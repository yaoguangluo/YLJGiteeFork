The Modern-Day Physician
No greater opportunity, responsibility, or obligation can fall to the lot of a human being than to become a physician. In the care of the suffering, [the physician] needs technical skill, scientific knowledge, and human understanding. . .. Tact, sympathy, and understanding are expected of the physician, for the patient is no mere collection of symptoms, signs, disordered functions, damaged organs, and disturbed emotions. [The patient] is human, fearful, and hopeful, seeking relief, help, and reassurance.
¡ªHarrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 1950
The practice of medicine has changed in significant ways since the first edition of this book appeared more than 60 years ago. The advent of molecular genetics, molecular biology, and molecular pathophysiology, sophisticated new imaging techniques, and advances in bioinformatics and information technology have contributed to an explosion of scientific information that has fundamentally changed the way physicians define, diagnose, treat, and prevent disease. This growth of scientific knowledge is ongoing and accelerating.
The widespread use of electronic medical records and the Internet have altered the way doctors practice medicine and exchange information. As today's physician struggles to integrate copious amounts of scientific knowledge into everyday practice, it is important to remember that the ultimate goal of medicine is to prevent disease and treat sick patients. Despite more than 60 years of scientific advances since the first edition of this text, it is critical to underscore that cultivating the intimate relationship between physician and patient still lies at the heart of successful patient care.
The Science and Art of Medicine

Deductive reasoning and applied technology form the foundation for the solution to many clinical problems. Spectacular advances in biochemistry, cell biology, and genomics, coupled with newly developed imaging techniques, allow access to the innermost parts of the cell and provide a window to the most remote recesses of the body. Revelations about the nature of genes and single cells have opened the portal for formulating a new molecular basis for the physiology of systems. Increasingly, physicians are learning how subtle changes in many different genes can affect the function of cells and organisms. Researchers are beginning to decipher the complex mechanisms by which genes are regulated. Doctors have developed a new appreciation of the role of stem cells in normal tissue function and in the development of cancer, degenerative disease, and other disorders, as well as their emerging role in the treatment of certain diseases. The knowledge gleaned from the science of medicine has already improved and undoubtedly will further improve physicians' understanding of complex disease processes and provide new approaches to disease treatment and prevention. Yet, skill in the most sophisticated application of laboratory technology and in the use of the latest therapeutic modality alone does not make a good physician.

When a patient poses challenging clinical problems, an effective physician must be able to identify the crucial elements in a complex history and physical examination; order the appropriate laboratory, imaging, and diagnostic tests; and extract the key results from the crowded computer printouts of data to determine whether to "treat" or to "watch." Deciding whether a clinical clue is worth pursuing or should be dismissed as a "red herring" and weighing whether a proposed test, preventive measure, or treatment entails a greater risk than the disease itself are essential judgments that a skilled clinician must make many times each day. This combination of medical knowledge, intuition, experience, and judgment defines the art of medicine, which is as necessary to the practice of medicine as is a sound scientific base.
 
Clinical Skills

History-Taking

The written history of an illness should include all the facts of medical significance in the life of the patient. Recent events should be given the most attention. The patient should, at some early point, have the opportunity to tell his or her own story of the illness without frequent interruption and, when appropriate, receive expressions of interest, encouragement, and empathy from the physician. Any event related by the patient, however trivial or seemingly irrelevant, may provide the key to solving the medical problem. In general, only patients who feel comfortable with the physician will offer complete information, and thus putting the patient at ease to the greatest extent possible contributes substantially to obtaining an adequate history.

An informative history is more than an orderly listing of symptoms; by listening to patients and noting the way in which they describe their symptoms, physicians can gain valuable insight into the problem. Inflections of voice, facial expression, gestures, and attitude, i.e., "body language," may reveal important clues to the meaning of the symptoms to the patient. Because patients vary in their medical sophistication and ability to recall facts, the reported medical history should be corroborated whenever possible. The social history also can provide important insights into the types of diseases that should be considered. The family history not only identifies rare Mendelian disorders within a family but often reveals risk factors for common disorders, such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, and asthma. A thorough family history may require input from multiple relatives to ensure completeness and accuracy, and once recorded, it can be updated readily. The process of history-taking provides an opportunity to observe the patient's behavior and watch for features to be pursued more thoroughly during the physical examination.

The very act of eliciting the history provides the physician with an opportunity to establish or enhance the unique bond that forms the basis for the ideal patient-physician relationship. This process helps the physician develop an appreciation of the patient's perception of the illness, the patient's expectations of the physician and the health care system, and the financial and social implications of the illness to the patient. Although current health care settings may impose time constraints on patient visits, it is important not to rush the history-taking since this may lead the patient to believe that what he or she is relating is not of importance to the physician and, therefore, may withhold relevant information. The confidentiality of the patient-physician relationship cannot be overemphasized.

Physical Examination

The purpose of the physical examination is to identify the physical signs of disease. The significance of these objective indications of disease is enhanced when they confirm a functional or structural change already suggested by the patient's history. At times, however, the physical signs may be the only evidence of disease.

The physical examination should be performed methodically and thoroughly, with consideration for the patient's comfort and modesty. Although attention is often directed by the history to the diseased organ or part of the body, the examination of a new patient must extend from head to toe in an objective search for abnormalities. Unless the physical examination is systematic and is performed in a consistent manner from patient to patient, important segments may be omitted inadvertently. The results of the examination, like the details of the history, should be recorded at the time they are elicited, not hours later, when they are subject to the distortions of memory. Skill in physical diagnosis is acquired with experience, but it is not merely technique that determines success in eliciting signs of disease. The detection of a few scattered petechiae, a faint diastolic murmur, or a small mass in the abdomen is not a question of keener eyes and ears or more sensitive fingers but of a mind alert to those findings. Because physical findings can change with time, the physical examination should be repeated as frequently as the clinical situation warrants. Because a large number of highly sensitive diagnostic tests are available, particularly imaging techniques, it may be tempting to put less emphasis on the physical examination. Indeed, many patients are seen for the first time after a series of diagnostic tests have been performed and the results are known. This fact should not deter the physician from performing a thorough physical examination since clinical findings are often present that have "escaped" the barrage of preexamination diagnostic tests. The act of examining (touching) the patient also offers an opportunity for communication and may have reassuring effects that foster the patient-physician relationship.

Diagnostic Studies

Physicians have become increasingly reliant on a wide array of laboratory tests to solve clinical problems. However, accumulated laboratory data do not relieve the physician from the responsibility of carefully observing, examining, and studying the patient. It is also essential to appreciate the limitations of diagnostic tests. By virtue of their impersonal quality, complexity, and apparent precision, they often gain an aura of authority regardless of the fallibility of the tests, the instruments used in the tests, and the individuals performing or interpreting them. Physicians must weigh the expense involved in the laboratory procedures against the value of the information they are likely to provide.

Single laboratory tests are rarely ordered. Instead, physicians generally request "batteries" of multiple tests, which often prove useful. For example, abnormalities of hepatic function may provide the clue to nonspecific symptoms such as generalized weakness and increased fatigability, suggesting the diagnosis of chronic liver disease. Sometimes a single abnormality, such as an elevated serum calcium level, points to a particular disease, such as hyperparathyroidism or an underlying malignancy.

The thoughtful use of screening tests such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol may be quite useful. A group of laboratory determinations can be carried out conveniently on a single specimen at relatively low cost. Screening tests are most informative when directed toward common diseases or disorders and when their results indicate the need for other useful tests or interventions that may be costly to perform. On the one hand, biochemical measurements, together with simple laboratory examinations such as blood count, urinalysis, and sedimentation rate, often provide a major clue to the presence of a pathologic process. On the other hand, the physician must learn to evaluate occasional abnormalities among the screening tests that may not necessarily connote significant disease. An in-depth workup after a report of an isolated laboratory abnormality in a person who is otherwise well is almost invariably wasteful and unproductive. Because so many tests are performed routinely as screening, it would not be unusual for one or two of them to be slightly abnormal. If there is no suspicion of an underlying illness, these tests ordinarily are repeated to ensure that the abnormality does not represent a laboratory error. If an abnormality is confirmed, it is important to consider its potential significance in the context of the patient's condition and other test results.

The development of technically improved imaging studies with greater sensitivity and specificity is one of the most rapidly advancing areas of medicine. These tests provide remarkably detailed anatomic information that can be a pivotal factor in medical decision-making. Ultrasonography, a variety of isotopic scans, CT, MRI, and positron emission tomography have benefited patients by supplanting older, more invasive approaches and opening new diagnostic vistas. In light of their capabilities and the rapidity with which they can lead to a diagnosis, it is tempting to order a battery of imaging studies. All physicians have had experiences in which imaging studies turned up findings that led to an unexpected diagnosis. Nonetheless, patients must endure each of these tests, and the added cost of unnecessary testing is substantial. Furthermore, investigation of an unexpected abnormal finding may be associated with risk and/or expense and may lead to the diagnosis of an irrelevant or incidental problem. A skilled physician must learn to use these powerful diagnostic tools judiciously, always considering whether the results will alter management and benefit the patient.
 
Principles of Patient Care

Evidence-Based Medicine

Evidence-based medicine refers to the concept that clinical decisions are formally supported by data, preferably data that are derived from prospectively designed, randomized, controlled clinical trials. This approach is in sharp contrast to anecdotal experience, which often may be biased. Unless they are attuned to the importance of using larger, more objective studies for making decisions, even the most experienced physicians can be influenced by recent encounters with selected patients. Evidence-based medicine has become an increasingly important part of the routine practice of medicine and has led to the publication of a number of practice guidelines.

Practice Guidelines

Professional organizations and government agencies are developing formal clinical-practice guidelines to aid physicians and other caregivers in making diagnostic and therapeutic decisions that are evidence-based, cost-effective, and most appropriate to a particular patient and clinical situation. As the evidence base of medicine increases, guidelines can provide a useful framework for managing patients with particular diagnoses or symptoms. They can protect patients¡ªparticularly those with inadequate health care benefits¡ªfrom receiving substandard care. Guidelines also can protect conscientious caregivers from inappropriate charges of malpractice and society from the excessive costs associated with the overuse of medical resources. There are, however, caveats associated with clinical-practice guidelines since they tend to oversimplify the complexities of medicine. Furthermore, groups with differing perspectives may develop divergent recommendations regarding issues as basic as the need for mammographic screening of women in their forties or a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) assay in the serum of men over age 50. Finally, guidelines do not¡ªand cannot be expected to¡ªaccount for the uniqueness of each individual and his or her illness. The physician's challenge is to integrate into clinical practice the useful recommendations offered by experts without accepting them blindly or being inappropriately constrained by them.

Medical Decision-Making

Medical decision-making is an important responsibility of the physician and occurs at each stage of the diagnostic and treatment process. It involves the ordering of additional tests, requests for consults, and decisions regarding treatment and prognosis. This process requires an in-depth understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of disease. As described above, medical decision-making should be evidence-based so that patients derive the full benefit of the scientific knowledge available to physicians. Formulating a differential diagnosis requires not only a broad knowledge base but also the ability to assess the relative probabilities of various diseases. Application of the scientific method, including hypothesis formation and data collection, is essential to the process of accepting or rejecting a particular diagnosis. Analysis of the differential diagnosis is an iterative process. As new information or test results are acquired, the group of disease processes being considered can be contracted or expanded appropriately.

Despite the importance of evidence-based medicine, much of medical decision-making relies on good clinical judgment, a process that is difficult to quantify or even to assess qualitatively. Physicians must use their knowledge and experience as a basis for weighing known factors along with the inevitable uncertainties and the need to use sound judgment; this synthesis of information is particularly important when a relevant evidence base is not available. Several quantitative tools may be invaluable in synthesizing the available information, including diagnostic tests, Bayes' theorem, and multivariate statistical models. Diagnostic tests serve to reduce uncertainty about a diagnosis or prognosis in a particular individual and help the physician decide how best to manage that individual's condition. The battery of diagnostic tests complements the history and the physical examination. The accuracy of a particular test is ascertained by determining its sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate) as well as the predictive value of a positive and a negative result. Bayes' theorem uses information on a test's sensitivity and specificity, in conjunction with the pretest probability of a diagnosis, to determine mathematically the posttest probability of the diagnosis. More complex clinical problems can be approached with multivariable statistical models, which generate highly accurate information even when multiple factors are acting individually or together to affect disease risk, progression, or response to treatment. Studies comparing the performance of statistical models with that of expert clinicians have documented equivalent accuracy, although the models tend to be more consistent. Thus, multivariate statistical models may be particularly helpful to less experienced clinicians. See Chap. 3 for a more thorough discussion of decision-making in clinical medicine.

Electronic Medical Records

Growing reliance on computers and the strength of information technology are playing an increasingly important role in medicine. Laboratory data are accessed almost universally through computers. Many medical centers now have electronic medical records, computerized order entry, and bar-coded tracking of medications. Some of these systems are interactive and provide reminders or warn of potential medical errors. In many ways, the health care system has lagged behind other industries in the adoption of information technology. Electronic medical records have extraordinary potential for providing rapid access to clinical information, imaging studies, laboratory results, and medications. This type of information is invaluable for ongoing efforts to enhance quality and improve patient safety. Ideally, patient records should be easily transferred across the health care system, providing reliable access to relevant data and historic information. However, technology limitations and concerns about privacy and cost continue to limit a broad-based utilization of electronic health records in most clinical settings. It also should be emphasized that information technology is merely a tool and can never replace the clinical decisions that are best made by the physician. In this regard, clinical knowledge and an understanding of the patient's needs, supplemented by quantitative tools, still seem to represent the best approach to decision-making in the practice of medicine.

Evaluation of Outcomes

Clinicians generally use objective and readily measurable parameters to judge the outcome of a therapeutic intervention. For example, findings on physical or laboratory examination¡ªsuch as the blood pressure level, the patency of a coronary artery on an angiogram, or the size of a mass on a radiologic examination¡ªcan provide critically important information. However, patients usually seek medical attention for subjective reasons; they wish to obtain relief from pain, preserve or regain function, and enjoy life. The components of a patient's health status or quality of life can include bodily comfort, capacity for physical activity, personal and professional function, sexual function, cognitive function, and overall perception of health. Each of these important areas can be assessed by means of structured interviews or specially designed questionnaires. Such assessments also provide useful parameters by which the physician can judge the patient's subjective view of his or her disability and the response to treatment, particularly in chronic illness. The practice of medicine requires consideration and integration of both objective and subjective outcomes.

Women's Health and Disease

Although past epidemiologic studies and clinical trials often focused predominantly on men, more recent studies have included more women, and some, like the Women's Health Initiative, have exclusively addressed women's health issues. Significant gender differences exist in diseases that afflict both men and women. Much is still to be learned in this arena, and ongoing studies should enhance physicians' understanding of the mechanisms of gender differences in the course and outcome of certain diseases. For a more complete discussion of women's health, see Chap. 6.

Care of the Elderly

The relative proportion of elderly individuals in the populations of developed nations has been growing considerably over the last few decades and will continue to grow. In this regard, the practice of medicine will continue to be greatly influenced by the health care needs of this growing elderly population. The physician must understand and appreciate the decline in physiologic reserve associated with aging; the diminished responses of the elderly to vaccinations such as those against influenza; the different responses of the elderly to common diseases; and disorders that occur commonly with aging, such as depression, dementia, frailty, urinary incontinence, and fractures. For a more complete discussion of medical care for the elderly, see Part 5, Chaps. 70, 71, and 72.

Errors in the Delivery of Health Care

A report from the Institute of Medicine called for an ambitious agenda to reduce medical error rates and improve patient safety by designing and implementing fundamental changes in health care systems. Adverse drug reactions occur in at least 5% of hospitalized patients, and the incidence increases with the use of a large number of drugs. No matter what the clinical situation is, it is the responsibility of the physician to use powerful therapeutic measures wisely, with due regard for their beneficial action, potential dangers, and cost. It is also the responsibility of hospitals and health care organizations to develop systems to reduce risk and ensure patient safety. Medication errors can be reduced through the use of ordering systems that eliminate misreading of handwriting. Implementation of infection control systems, enforcement of hand washing protocols, and careful oversight of antibiotic use can minimize the complications of nosocomial infections.

The Role of the Physician in the Informed Consent of the Patient

The fundamental principles of medical ethics require physicians to act in the patient's best interest and respect the patient's autonomy. This is particularly relevant to the issue of informed consent. Most patients possess only limited medical knowledge and must rely on their physicians for advice. Physicians must respect their patients' autonomy, fully discussing the alternatives for care and the risks, benefits, and likely consequences of each alternative. Special care should be taken to ensure that a physician seeking a patient's informed consent does not have a real or apparent conflict of interest involving personal gain.

Patients are required to sign a consent form for essentially any diagnostic or therapeutic procedure. In such cases, it is particularly important for the patient to understand clearly the risks and benefits of these procedures; this is the definition of informed consent. It is incumbent on the physician to explain the procedures in a clear and understandable manner and to ascertain that the patient comprehends both the nature of the procedure and the attendant risks and benefits. The dread of the unknown, inherent in hospitalization, can be mitigated by such explanations.

The Approach to Grave Prognoses and Death

No problem is more distressing than the diagnosis of an incurable disease, particularly when premature death is inevitable. What should the patient and family be told? What measures should be taken to maintain life? What can be done to maintain the quality of life?

Although some would argue otherwise, there is no ironclad rule that the patient must immediately be told "everything" even if the patient is an adult with substantial family responsibilities. Nevertheless, openness and honesty with the patient is a must. A patient must know the expected course of disease to make appropriate plans and preparations. The patient should participate in decision-making with an understanding of the treatment goals (cure or palliation), the disease effects, and the likely treatment effects. A wise and insightful physician often is guided by an understanding of what a patient wants to know and when he or she wants to know it. The patient's religious beliefs also may be taken into consideration. The patient must be given an opportunity to talk with the physician and ask questions. Patients may find it easier to share their feelings about death with their physician, who is likely to be more objective and less emotional, than with family members. As William Osler wrote, "One thing is certain; it is not for you to don the black cap and, assuming the judicial function, take hope away from any patient." Even when the patient directly inquires, "Am I dying?" the physician must attempt to determine whether this is a request for information or for reassurance. Only open communication between the patient and the physician can resolve this question and guide the physician in what to say and how to say it.

The physician should provide or arrange for emotional, physical, and spiritual support and must be compassionate, unhurried, and open. There is much to be gained by the laying on of hands. Pain should be controlled adequately, human dignity maintained, and isolation from family and close friends avoided. These aspects of care tend to be overlooked in hospitals, where the intrusion of life-sustaining apparatus can detract from attention to the whole person and encourage concentration instead on the life-threatening disease, against which the battle ultimately will be lost in any case. In the face of terminal illness, the goal of medicine must shift from cure to care in the broadest sense of the term. Primum succurrere, first hasten to provide help, is a guiding principle. In offering care to a dying patient, a physician must be prepared to provide information to family members and deal with their grief and sometimes their feelings of guilt. It is important for the doctor to assure the family that everything possible has been done. For a more complete discussion of end-of-life care, see Chap. 9.
 
The Patient-Physician Relationship

The significance of the intimate personal relationship between physician and patient cannot be too strongly emphasized, for in an extraordinarily large number of cases both the diagnosis and treatment are directly dependent on it. One of the essential qualities of the clinician is interest in humanity, for the secret of the care of the patient is in caring for the patient.

¡ªFrancis W. Peabody, 1881¨C1927

Physicians must never forget that patients are individual human beings with problems that all too often transcend their physical complaints. They are not "cases" or "admissions" or "diseases." Patients do not fail treatments; treatments fail to benefit patients. This point is particularly important in this era of high technology in clinical medicine. Most patients are anxious and fearful. Physicians should instill confidence and should be reassuring but should never be arrogant. A professional attitude, coupled with warmth and openness, can do much to alleviate anxiety and to encourage patients to share all aspects of their medical history. Empathy and compassion are the essential features of a caring physician. Whatever the patient's attitude is, the physician needs to consider the setting in which an illness occurs¡ªin terms not only of the patients themselves but also of their familial, social, and cultural backgrounds. The ideal patient-physician relationship is based on thorough knowledge of the patient, mutual trust, and the ability to communicate.

The Dichotomy of Inpatient and Outpatient Internal Medicine

The hospital environment has changed dramatically over the last few decades. In more recent times, emergency departments and critical care units have evolved to identify and manage critically ill patients, allowing them to survive formerly fatal diseases. There is increasing pressure to reduce the length of stay in the hospital and to manage complex disorders in the outpatient setting. This transition has been driven not only by efforts to reduce costs but also by the availability of new outpatient technologies, such as imaging and percutaneous infusion catheters for long-term antibiotics or nutrition, minimally invasive surgical procedures, and evidence that outcomes often are improved by minimizing inpatient hospitalization. Hospitals now consist of multiple distinct levels of care, such as the emergency department, procedure rooms, overnight observation units, critical care units, and palliative care units, in addition to traditional medical beds. A consequence of this differentiation has been the emergence of new specialties such as emergency medicine, intensivists, hospitalists, and end-of-life care. Moreover, these systems frequently involve "handoffs" from the outpatient to the inpatient environment, from the critical care unit to a general medicine floor, and from the hospital to the outpatient environment. Clearly, one of the important challenges in internal medicine is to maintain continuity of care and information flow during these transitions, which threaten the traditional one-to-one relationship between patient and physician. In the current environment, teams of physicians, specialists, and other health care professionals often replace the personal interaction between doctor and patient. The patient can benefit greatly from effective collaboration among a number of health care professionals; however, it is the duty of the patient's principal or primary physician to provide cohesive guidance through an illness. To meet this challenge, the primary physician must be familiar with the techniques, skills, and objectives of specialist physicians and allied health professionals. The primary physician must ensure that the patient will benefit from scientific advances and from the expertise of specialists when they are needed while retaining responsibility for the major decisions concerning diagnosis and treatment.

Appreciation of the Patient's Hospital Experience

The hospital is an intimidating environment for most individuals. Hospitalized patients find themselves surrounded by air jets, buttons, and glaring lights; invaded by tubes and wires; and beset by the numerous members of the health care team¡ªnurses, nurses' aides, physicians' assistants, social workers, technologists, physical therapists, medical students, house officers, attending and consulting physicians, and many others. They may be transported to special laboratories and imaging facilities replete with blinking lights, strange sounds, and unfamiliar personnel; they may be left unattended for periods of time; they may be obliged to share a room with other patients, who have their own health problems. It is little wonder that patients may lose their sense of reality. Physicians who can appreciate the hospital experience from the patient's perspective and make an effort to develop a strong personal relationship with the patient in which they may guide the patient through this experience can make a stressful situation more tolerable.

Trends in the Delivery of Health Care: A Challenge to the Humane Physician

Many trends in the delivery of health care tend to make medical care impersonal. These trends, some of which have been mentioned already, include (1) vigorous efforts to reduce the escalating costs of health care; (2) the growing number of managed-care programs, which are intended to reduce costs but in which the patient may have little choice in selecting a physician or in seeing that physician consistently; (3) increasing reliance on technological advances and computerization for many aspects of diagnosis and treatment; (4) the need for numerous physicians to be involved in the care of most patients who are seriously ill; and (5) an increased number of malpractice suits, some of which are justifiable because of medical errors but others of which reflect an unrealistic expectation on the part of many patients that their disease will be cured or that complications will not occur during the course of complex illnesses or procedures.

In light of these changes in the medical care system, it is a major challenge for physicians to maintain the humane aspects of medical care. The American Board of Internal Medicine, working together with the American College of Physicians¨CAmerican Society of Internal Medicine and the European Federation of Internal Medicine, has published a Charter on Medical Professionalism that underscores three main principles in physicians' contract with society: (1) the primacy of patient welfare, (2) patient autonomy, and (3) social justice. Medical schools appropriately place substantial emphasis on physician professionalism (Fig. 1-1). The humanistic qualities of a physician must encompass integrity, respect, and compassion. Availability, the expression of sincere concern, the willingness to take the time to explain all aspects of the illness, and a nonjudgmental attitude when dealing with patients whose cultures, lifestyles, attitudes, and values differ from those of the physician are just a few of the characteristics of a humane physician. Every physician will, at times, be challenged by patients who evoke strongly negative or positive emotional responses. Physicians should be alert to their own reactions to such patients and situations and consciously monitor and control their behavior so that the patient's best interest remains the principal motivation for their actions at all times.

An important aspect of patient care involves an appreciation of the patient's "quality of life," a subjective assessment of what each patient values most. This assessment requires detailed, sometimes intimate knowledge of the patient, which usually can be obtained only through deliberate, unhurried, and often repeated conversations. Time pressures will always threaten these interactions, but they should not diminish the importance of understanding and seeking to fulfill the priorities of the patient.
 
The Twenty-First-Century Physician: Expanding Frontiers

The era of "omics": genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, microbiomics, metagenomics, metabolomics . . .

In the spring of 2003, the complete sequencing of the human genome was announced, officially ushering in the genomic era. However, even before that landmark accomplishment, the practice of medicine had been evolving as a result of the insights gained from an understanding of the human genome as well as the genomes of a wide variety of microbes, whose genetic sequences were becoming widely available as a result of breathtaking advances in sequencing techniques and informatics. An example is the rapid identification of H1N1 influenza as a potentially fatal pandemic illness and the rapid development and dissemination of an effective protective vaccine. Today, gene expression profiles are being used to guide therapy and inform prognosis for a number of diseases, the use of genotyping is providing a new means to assess the risk of certain diseases as well as variation in response to a number of drugs, and physicians are beginning to understand better the role of certain genes in the causality of common conditions such as obesity and allergies. Despite these advances, scientists are still in the infancy of understanding and utilizing the complexities of genomics in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of disease. The task of physicians is complicated by the fact that phenotypes generally are determined not by genes alone but by the interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Indeed, researchers have just begun to scratch the surface of possibilities that the era of genomics will provide to the practice of medicine.

Rapid progress also is being made in other areas of molecular medicine. Epigenomics is the study of alterations in chromatin and histone proteins and methylation of DNA sequences that influence gene expression. Epigenetic alterations are associated with a number of cancers and other diseases. The study of the entire library of proteins made in a cell or organ and its relationship to disease is called proteomics. Proteomics is now recognized as far more complex than originally considered, enhancing the repertoire of the 30,000 genes in the human genome by alternate splicing and posttranslational processing as well as by an increasing number of posttranslational modifications, many with unique functional consequences. The presence or absence of particular proteins in the circulation or in cells is being explored for diagnostic and disease-screening uses. Microbiomics is the study of the bacterial flora of a person. Interesting research is suggesting that the composition of colonic flora may play a role in obesity and in other diseases. Metagenomics, of which microbiomics is a part, is the genomic study of environmental species that have the potential to influence human biology directly or indirectly. An example is the study of exposures to microorganisms in farm environments that might be responsible for the lower incidence of asthma among farm-raised children. Metabolomics is the study of the range of metabolites in cells or organs and the ways they are altered in disease states. The aging process itself may leave telltale metabolic footprints that allow the prediction (and possibly the prevention) of dysfunction and disease. It seems likely that disease-associated patterns will be sought in lipids, carbohydrates, membranes, mitochondria, and other vital components of cells and tissues. All this new information represents a challenge to the traditional reductionist approach to medical thinking. The variability of results in different patients, together with the large number of variables that can be assessed, creates difficulties in identifying preclinical disease and defining disease states unequivocally. Accordingly, the tools of systems biology are being applied to the myriad information now obtainable from every patient and may provide new approaches to classifying disease. For a more complete discussion of a complex systems approach to human disease, see Chap. e19.

The rapidity of these advances may seem overwhelming to the practicing physician. However, he or she has an important role to play in ensuring that these powerful technologies and sources of new information are applied with sensitivity and intelligence to the patient. Since "omics" is such a rapidly evolving field, physicians and other health care professionals must continue to educate themselves so that they can apply this new knowledge to the benefit of their patients' health and well-being. Genetic testing requires wise counsel based on an understanding of the value and limitations of the tests as well as the implications of their results for specific individuals. For a more complete discussion of genetic testing, see Chap. 63.

The Globalization of Medicine

Physicians should be cognizant of diseases and health care services beyond local boundaries. Global travel has implications for disease spread, and it is not uncommon for diseases endemic to certain regions to be seen in other regions after a patient has traveled to and returned from those regions. Patients have broader access to unique expertise or clinical trials at distant medical centers, and the cost of travel may be offset by the quality of care at those distant locations. As much as any other factor influencing global aspects of medicine, the Internet has transformed the transfer of medical information throughout the world. This change has been accompanied by the transfer of technological skills through telemedicine and international consultation for radiologic images and pathologic specimens. For a complete discussion of global issues, see Chap. 2.

Medicine on the Internet

On the whole, the Internet has had a very positive effect on the practice of medicine; a wide range of information is available to physicians and patients through personal computers almost instantaneously at any time and from anywhere in the world. This medium holds enormous potential for delivering current information, practice guidelines, state-of-the-art conferences, journal contents, textbooks (including this text), and direct communications with other physicians and specialists, expanding the depth and breadth of information available to the physician about the diagnosis and care of patients. Medical journals are now accessible online, providing rapid sources of new information. This medium also serves to lessen the information gap felt by physicians and health care providers in remote areas by bringing them into direct and timely contact with the latest developments in medical care.

Patients, too, are turning to the Internet in increasing numbers to acquire information about their illnesses and therapies and to join Internet-based support groups. Physicians increasingly are faced with the prospect of dealing with patients who arrive with sophisticated information about their illnesses. In this regard, physicians are challenged in a positive way to keep abreast of the latest relevant information while serving as an "editor" for the patients as they navigate this seemingly endless source of information, the accuracy and validity of which are not uniform.

A critically important caveat is that virtually anything can be published on the Internet, with easy circumvention of the peer-review process that is an essential feature of academic publications. Physicians or patients who search the Internet for medical information must be aware of this danger. Notwithstanding this limitation, appropriate use of the Internet is revolutionizing information access for physicians and patients and in this regard is a great benefit that was not available to earlier practitioners.

Public Expectations and Accountability

The level of knowledge and sophistication regarding health issues on the part of the general public has grown rapidly over the last few decades. As a result, expectations of the health care system in general and of physicians in particular have risen. Physicians are expected to master rapidly advancing fields (the science of medicine) while considering their patients' unique needs (the art of medicine). Thus, physicians are held accountable not only for the technical aspects of the care that they provide but also for their patients' satisfaction with the delivery and costs of care.

In many parts of the world, physicians increasingly are expected to account for the way in which they practice medicine by meeting certain standards prescribed by federal and local governments. The hospitalization of patients whose health care costs are reimbursed by the government and other third parties is subjected to utilization review. Thus, a physician must defend the cause for and duration of a patient's hospitalization if it falls outside certain "average" standards. Authorization for reimbursement increasingly is based on documentation of the nature and complexity of an illness, as reflected by recorded elements of the history and physical examination. There is a growing "pay for performance" movement that seeks to link reimbursement to quality of care. The goal of this movement is to improve standards of health care and contain spiraling health care costs. Physicians also are expected to give evidence of their continuing competence through mandatory continuing education, patient record audits, maintenance of certification, and relicensing.

Medical Ethics and New Technologies

The rapid pace of technological advances has profound implications for medical applications far beyond their traditional roles to prevent, treat, and cure disease. Cloning, genetic engineering, gene therapy, human-computer interfaces, nanotechnology, and designer drugs have the potential to modify inherited predispositions to disease, select desired characteristics in embryos, augment "normal" human performance, replace failing tissues, and substantially prolong life span. Because of their unique training, physicians have a responsibility to help shape the debate concerning the appropriate uses of and limits that should be placed on these new techniques.

The Physician as Perpetual Student

It becomes all too apparent from the time doctors graduate from medical school that as physicians their lot is that of the "perpetual student" and the mosaic of their knowledge and experiences is eternally unfinished. This concept can be at the same time exhilarating and anxiety-provoking. It is exhilarating because doctors will continue to expand knowledge that can be applied to their patients; it is anxiety-provoking because doctors realize that they will never know as much as they want or need to know. At best, doctors will translate this latter feeling into energy to continue to improve themselves and realize their potential as physicians. In this regard, it is the responsibility of a physician to pursue new knowledge continually by reading, attending conferences and courses, and consulting colleagues and the Internet. This is often a difficult task for a busy practitioner; however, such a commitment to continued learning is an integral part of being a physician and must be given the highest priority.

The Physician as Citizen

Being a physician is a privilege. The capacity to apply one's skills for the benefit of one's fellow human beings is a noble calling. The doctor-patient relationship is inherently unbalanced in the distribution of power. In light of a doctor's influence, he or she must always be aware of the potential impact of what he or she does and says and must always strive to strip away individual biases and preferences to find what is best for the patient. To the extent possible, a physician also should try to act within his or her community to promote health and alleviate suffering. Meeting these goals begins by setting a healthy example and continues in actions that may be taken to deliver needed care even when personal financial compensation may not be available.

G. H. T. Kimble wrote: "It is bad enough that a [person] should be ignorant, for this cuts him [or her] off from the commerce of [people's] minds. It is perhaps worse that a [person] should be poor, for this condemns him [or her] to a life of stint and scheming in which there is no time for dreams and no respite from weariness. But what surely is worse is that a [person] should be unwell, for this prevents his [or her] doing anything much about either his [or her] poverty or his [or her] ignorance." A goal for medicine and its practitioners is to strive to provide the means by which the poor can cease to be unwell.

Learning Medicine

It has been about 100 years since the publication of the Flexner Report, a seminal study that transformed medical education and emphasized the scientific foundations of medicine as well as the acquisition of clinical skills. In an era of burgeoning information and access to medical simulation and informatics, many schools are implementing new curricula that emphasize lifelong learning and the acquisition of competencies in teamwork, communication skills, system-based practice, and professionalism. These and other features of the medical school curriculum provide the foundation for many of the themes highlighted in this chapter and are expected to allow physicians to progress from competency to proficiency to mastery with progressive experience and learning.

At a time when the amount of information that one must master to practice medicine continues to expand, increasing pressures both within and outside of medicine have produced strict restrictions on the amount of time a physician in training can spend in the hospital. It was felt that the benefits associated with the continuity of medical care and observation of the patient's progress over time were outstripped by the stresses of long hours on the trainees and the fatigue-related errors they made in caring for patients. Accordingly, physicians in training had limits set on the number of patients they could carry at a time, the number of new patients they could evaluate in a day on call, and the number of hours they could spend in the hospital. In 1980, residents in medicine worked in the hospital more than 90 hours a week on average. In 1989, their hours were restricted to no more than 80 a week. Resident physicians' hours further decreased by about 10% between 1996 and 2008, and in 2010, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) placed further restrictions on continuing in-hospital duty hours for first year residents (16 hours/shift). The impact of these changes is continuing to be assessed, but the evidence that medical errors have decreased as a consequence is sparse. An unavoidable by-product of fewer hours at work is an increase in the number of "handoffs" of patient responsibility from one physician to another. These transfers often involve a transition from a physician who knows the patient well, having evaluated the patient on admission, to a physician who knows the patient less well. It is imperative that these transitions of responsibility be handled with care and thoroughness with all the relevant information exchanged and acknowledged. The issue of coverage is not limited to physicians in graduate training. The average practicing physician worked 54 hours per week in 1996¨C1998 and 51 hours per week in 2006¨C2008.

Research, Teaching, and the Practice of Medicine

The title doctor is derived from the Latin docere, "to teach," and physicians should share information and medical knowledge with colleagues, students of medicine and related professions, and their patients. The practice of medicine is dependent on the sum total of medical knowledge, which in turn is based on an unending chain of scientific discovery, clinical observation, analysis, and interpretation. Advances in medicine depend on the acquisition of new information through research, and improved medical care requires the transmission of that information. As part of broader societal responsibilities, the physician should encourage patients to participate in ethical and properly approved clinical investigations if they do not impose undue hazard, discomfort, or inconvenience. However, physicians engaged in clinical research must be alert to potential conflicts of interest between their research goals and their obligations to individual patients; the best interests of the patient must always take priority.

To wrest from nature the secrets which have perplexed philosophers in all ages, to track to their sources the causes of disease, to correlate the vast stores of knowledge, that they may be quickly available for the prevention and cure of disease¡ªthese are our ambitions.

Why Global Health?

Global health, it has been noted, is not a discipline; it is, rather, a collection of problems. A leading group of scholars have defined global health as the study and practice concerned with improving the health of all people and achieving health equity worldwide, with an emphasis on addressing problems that are transnational. No single review can do much more than identify the leading problems in applying evidence-based medicine in settings of great poverty or across national boundaries. This chapter introduces the major international bodies that address these problems; identifies the more significant barriers to improving the health of people who to date have not, by and large, had access to modern medicines; and summarizes population-based data on the most common health problems faced by people living in poverty. Examining specific problems¡ªnotably AIDS (Chap. 189) but also tuberculosis (TB, Chap. 165), malaria (Chap. 210), and key noncommunicable diseases¡ªhelps sharpen the discussion of barriers to prevention, diagnosis, and care as well as the means of overcoming them. The chapter then discusses the role of health systems and the problem of "brain drain" on those systems. It closes by discussing global health equity, drawing on notions of social justice that once were central to international public health but have fallen out of favor over the last several decades.
 
Brief History of Global Health Institutions

Concern about health across national boundaries dates back many centuries, predating the Black Plague and other pandemics. The first organization founded explicitly to tackle cross-border health issues was the Pan American Sanitary Bureau, which was formed by 11 countries in the Americas in 1902. The primary goal of what later became the Pan American Health Organization was the control of infectious diseases across the Americas. Of special concern was yellow fever, which had been running a deadly course through much of South and Central America and posed a threat to the construction of the Panama Canal. In 1948, the United Nations formed the first truly global health institution: the World Health Organization (WHO). In 1958, under the aegis of the WHO and in line with a long-standing focus on communicable diseases that cross borders, leaders in global health initiated the effort that led to what some see as the greatest success in international health: the eradication of smallpox. Naysayers were surprised when the smallpox eradication campaign, which engaged public health officials throughout the world, proved successful in 1979 during the Cold War. The influence of the WHO waned during the 1980s. In the early 1990s, many observers argued that with its vastly superior financial resources and close if unequal relationships with the governments of poor countries, the World Bank had eclipsed the WHO as the most important multilateral institution working in the area of health. One of the stated goals of the World Bank was to help poor countries identify "cost-effective" interventions worthy of international public support. At the same time, the World Bank encouraged many of those nations to reduce public expenditures in health and education as part of later discredited structural adjustment programs that were imposed as a condition for access to credit and assistance through international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). At the same time, there was a resurgence of many diseases, including malaria, trypanosomiasis, are schistosomiasis, in Africa.Tuberculosis, an eminently curable disease, remained the world's leading infectious killer of adults. Half a million women per year died in childbirth during the last decade of the twentieth century, and few of the world's largest philanthropic or funding institutions focused on global health.

AIDS, first described in 1981, precipitated a change. In the United States, the advent of this newly described infectious killer marked the culmination of a series of events that discredited talk of "closing the book" on infectious diseases. In Africa, which would emerge as the global epicenter of the pandemic, HIV disease strained TB control programs, and malaria continued to take as many lives as ever. At the dawn of the twenty-first century, these three diseases alone killed an estimated 6 million people each year. New research, new policies, and new funding mechanisms were called for. The last decade has seen the rise of important multilateral global health institutions such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (GFATM) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS); bilateral efforts such as the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR); and private philanthropic organizations such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Yet with its 193 member states and 147 country offices, the WHO remains preeminent in matters relating to the cross-border spread of infectious diseases and other health threats. In the aftermath of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2003, the International Health Regulations¡ªwhich provide a legal foundation for the WHO's direct investigation of a wide range of global health problems, including pandemic influenza, in any member state¡ªwere strengthened and brought into force in May 2007.

Even as attention to and resources for health problems in poor countries grow, the lack of coherence in and among global health institutions may undermine efforts to forge a more comprehensive and effective response. The WHO is still woefully underfunded despite the ever-growing need to engage a wider and more complex range of health issues. In another instance of the paradoxical impact of success, the rapid growth of the Gates Foundation, which is clearly one of the most important developments in the history of global health, has led other foundations to question the wisdom of continuing to invest their more modest resources in this field. This indeed may be what some have called "the golden age of global health," but leaders of major organizations such as the WHO, the GFATM, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), UNAIDS, PEPFAR, and the Gates Foundation must work together to design an effective architecture that will make the most of the opportunities that now exist. To this end, new and old players in global health must invest heavily in discovery (relevant basic science), the development of new tools (preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic), and delivery to ensure the equitable provision of health products and services to all who need them.
 
The Economics of Global Health

Political and economic concerns have often guided global health interventions. As mentioned, early efforts to control yellow fever were tied to the completion of the Panama Canal. However, the precise nature of the link between economics and health remains a matter for debate. Some economists and demographers argue that improving the health status of populations must begin with economic development; others maintain that addressing ill health is the starting point for development in poor countries. In either case, investment in health care, especially the control of communicable diseases, should lead to increased productivity. The question is where to find the necessary resources to start the predicted "virtuous cycle."

Since 1999, spurred by the leadership of the Gates Foundation and the growing interest in addressing novel and persistent challenges such as AIDS, spending on health in poor countries has increased, with over $80 billion in new funds earmarked for the discovery and development of drugs and diagnostics targeting diseases of the poor; comprehensive responses to the AIDS, TB, and malaria epidemics; vaccine development and delivery; and even improved methods of data collection in resource-poor settings. Nevertheless, to reach the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, that include targets for poverty reduction, universal primary education, and gender equality, spending in the health sector must be increased further. To determine by how much and for how long, it is imperative to improve the ability to assess the global burden of disease (GBD) and plan interventions that more precisely match the need. Refining metrics is an important task for global health: only recently have there been solid assessments of the GBD.
 
Mortality and the Global Burden of Disease

Since the late 1980s, serious efforts have been made to calculate the GBD. The first GBD study, conducted in 1990, laid the foundation for the first report on Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries (DCP1) and for the World Bank's 1993 World Development Report Investing in Health. Those efforts represented a major advance in the understanding of health status in developing countries. Investing in Health has been especially influential: it familiarized a broad audience with cost-effectiveness analysis for specific health interventions and with the notion of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The DALY, which has become a standard measure of the impact of a specific health condition on a population, combines in a single measure both absolute years of life lost and years lost due to disability for incident cases of a condition. (See Fig. 2-1 and Table 2-1 for an analysis of the GBD by DALYs.)

The most recent WHO analysis of the GBD was based on health data from 2004. This report reflects growth in the available data on health in the poorest countries and in the capacity to measure the impact of specific conditions on a population. Yet even in 2004, only 112 of 192 nations surveyed had reliable information on the causes of deaths within their borders. It is essential to expand efforts to collect the most basic health data; this task falls to the WHO, national governments, and certain academic institutions. The lack of complete data has led to considerable uncertainty in estimates of overall mortality rates. The level of uncertainty ranges from as low as ¡À 1% for estimates of all-cause mortality in developed countries to ¡À 20% for all-cause mortality in the WHO's African Region. The level of uncertainty in regional prevalence estimates ranges from ¡À 10% to ¡À 90%, with a median value of ¡À 41%. As analytic methods and data quality have improved, however, important trends can be identified in a comparison of GBD estimates from 1990 and 2004.

Of the 58.8 million deaths worldwide in 2004, 30% were due to communicable diseases, maternal and perinatal conditions, and nutritional deficiencies. Although the proportion of all deaths attributable to these causes has decreased marginally since 1990, the share of all deaths due to HIV/AIDS grew from just 2% to >3.5%. Among the fraction of all deaths related to communicable diseases, maternal and perinatal conditions, and nutritional deficiencies, 97% occurred in middle- and low-income countries. The leading cause of death among adults in 2004 was ischemic heart disease, accounting for 16.3% of all deaths in high-income countries, 13.9% in middle-income countries, and 9.4% in low-income countries (Table 2-2). In second place was cerebrovascular disease, that accounted for 9.3% of deaths in high-income countries, 14.2% in middle-income countries, and 5.6% in low-income countries. Although the third leading cause of death in high-income countries was tracheal, bronchial, and lung cancers (that accounted for 5.9% of all deaths), those conditions did not even register in the top 10 places in low-income countries. Among the 10 leading causes of death in low-income countries, 6 were communicable diseases; in high-income countries, however, only one communicable disease¡ªlower respiratory infection¡ªranked among the top 10 causes of death.

A recent study found that the worldwide mortality figure among children <5 years of age dropped from 11.9 million deaths in 1990 to 7.7 million in 2010. Of the deaths in 2010, 3.1 million (40%) occurred in the neonatal period. About one-third of these deaths among children <5 years old occurred in southern Asia and almost one-half in sub-Saharan Africa; <1% occurred in high-income countries.

Among persons 15¨C59 years of age, noncommunicable diseases accounted for more than one-half of all deaths in all regions except sub-Saharan Africa, where communicable diseases, maternal and perinatal conditions, and nutritional deficiencies together accounted for two-thirds of all deaths. Indeed, the HIVmortality rate among 15- to 59-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa was higher than the mortality rate due to all causes among adults in high-income countries. In this age group, injuries accounted for 23% of all deaths worldwide. Overall, death rates in this age group declined between 1990 and 2004 in all areas except Europe and Central Asia, where cardiovascular diseases and injuries caused increased mortality rates, and sub-Saharan Africa, where the impact of HIV/AIDS in this age cohort was particularly devastating.

There is greater uncertainty in calculating years of life lived with disability for specific conditions than in calculating years of life lost. Best estimates from 2004 reveal that although the prevalence of diseases common in older populations (e.g., dementia and musculoskeletal disease) was higher in high-income countries, the disability experienced as a result of cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and the long-term impact of communicable diseases was greater in low- and middle-income countries. In most low- and middle-income countries, people lived shorter lives and experienced disability and poor health for a greater proportion of their lives. Indeed, >50% of the GBD occurred in southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, which together account for only one-third of the world's population.

Noncommunicable diseases accounted for almost 60% of all deaths in 2004 but, because of the later onset of those diseases, accounted for only 48% of years of life lost. In contrast, because they more often involve younger people, injuries accounted for 12% of years of life lost but for only 10% of deaths. Notably, 45% of the disease burden in middle-income countries in 2004 resulted from noncommunicable conditions; in 1990, the figure was 35%.

Poverty remains one of the most important root causes of poor health worldwide, and the global burden of poverty continues to be high. Among the 6.8 billion people alive today, 43% (~2.7 billion) live on <$2 per day and 17% (~1.1 billion) live on <$1 per day. Comparison of national health indicators with gross domestic product per capita among nations shows a clear relationship between higher gross domestic product and better health, with only a few outliers. Numerous studies also have documented the link between poverty and health within countries.

The Global Burden of Disease Study found that undernutrition was the leading risk factor for poor health. In an era that has seen obesity become a major health concern in many developed countries, the persistence of undernutrition is surely cause for great consternation. Inability to feed the hungry provides evidence of many years of failed development projects and must be addressed as a problem of the highest priority. Indeed, no health care initiative, however generously funded and scientifically justified, will be effective without adequate nutrition.

The second edition of Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries (DCP2), published in 2006, is a document of stunning breadth and ambition, providing cost-effectiveness analyses for >100 interventions and including 21 chapters focused on strategies for strengthening health systems. Cost-effectiveness analyses that compare two relatively equal interventions and facilitate the best choices under constraint are important; however, as both resources and ambitions for global health grow, cost-effectiveness analyses (particularly those based on past conditions) must not hobble the increased worldwide commitment to provide resources and accessible services to all who need them. To illustrate this point, it is instructive to look to AIDS, that in the course of the last three decades has become the world's leading infectious cause of adult death.

AIDS

Chapter 189 provides an overview of the AIDSepidemic in the world today. Here the discussion will be limited to AIDS in the developing world. Lessons learned in tackling AIDS in resource-constrained settings are highly relevant to discussions of other chronic diseases, including noncommunicable diseases, for which effective therapies have been developed. Several of these lessons are highlighted below.

In the United States, the availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) for AIDS has transformed this disease from an inescapably fatal destruction of cell-mediated immunity into a manageable chronic illness. In developing countries, treatment has been offered more broadly only since 2003, and only in the fall of 2008 did the number of patients receiving treatment exceed 40% of the number who need it. (It remains to be seen how many of these fortunate few are receiving ART regularly and with the requisite social support.) Before 2003, many arguments were raised to justify not moving forward rapidly with ART programs for people living with HIV/AIDS in resource-limited settings. The standard litany included the price of therapy compared with the poverty of the patient, the complexity of the intervention, the lack of infrastructure for laboratory monitoring, and the lack of trained health care providers. Narrow cost-effectiveness arguments that created false dichotomies¡ªprevention or treatment rather than both¡ªtoo often went unchallenged. The greatest obstacle at the time was the ambivalence, if not outright silence, of political leaders and experts in public health. The cumulative effect of these factors was to condemn to death tens of millions of poor people in developing countries who had become ill as a result of HIV infection.

The inequity between rich and poor countries in access to HIV treatment has given rise to widespread moral indignation. In several middle-income countries, including Brazil, visionary programs have bridged the access gap. Other innovative projects pioneered by international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in diverse settings have clearly established that a very simple approach to ART that is based on intensive community engagement and support can achieve remarkable results. In 2000, the United Nations Accelerating Access Initiative finally brought the research-based and generic pharmaceutical industries into play, and prices of AIDS drugs have fallen significantly. At the same time, fixed-dose combination drugs that are easier to administer have become more widely available.

Building on these lessons, the WHO advocated a public health approach to the treatment of people with AIDS in resource-limited settings. This approach, derived from models of care pioneered by the NGO Partners In Health and other groups, proposed standard first-line treatment regimens based on a simple five-drug formulary, with a more complex (and far more expensive) set of second-line options in reserve. Common clinical protocols were standardized, and intensive training packages for health and community health workers were developed and implemented in many countries. Those efforts were supported by new funding from the World Bank, the GFATM, and PEPFAR. In 2003, the lack of access to ART was declared a global public health emergency by the WHO and UNAIDS, and those two agencies launched the "3 by 5 initiative," setting an ambitious target: to have 3 million people in developing countries in treatment by the end of 2005. Many countries have since set corresponding national targets and have worked to integrate ART into their national AIDS programs and health systems and to harness the synergies between HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention activities. The efficacy of ART is well documented: in the United States, such therapy has prolonged life by an estimated average of 13 years per patient¡ªa better success rate than that obtained with almost any treatment for cancer or for complications of coronary artery disease. Further lessons with implications for policy and action have come from efforts now underway in the developing world. During the last decade, through experiences in >50 countries thus far, the world has seen that ambitious policy goals, adequate funding, and knowledge about implementation can dramatically transform the prospects of people living with HIV infection in developing nations.

Tuberculosis

Chapter 165 provides a concise overview of the pathophysiology and treatment of TB, which is closely linked to HIV infection in much of the world. Indeed, a substantial proportion of the resurgence of TB registered in southern Africa may be attributed to HIV co-infection. Even before the advent of HIV, however, it was estimated that fewer than one-half of all cases of TB in developing countries were ever diagnosed, much less treated.

Primarily because of the common failure to diagnose and treat TB, international authorities devised a single strategy to reduce the burden of disease. The DOTS strategy (directly observed therapy using short-course isoniazid- and rifampin-based regimens) was promoted in the early 1990s as highly cost-effective by the World Bank, the WHO, and other international bodies. Passive case finding of smear-positive patients was central to the strategy, and an uninterrupted drug supply was, of course, deemed necessary for cure. DOTS was clearly effective for most uncomplicated cases of drug-susceptible TB, but a number of shortcomings soon were identified. First, the diagnosis of TB based solely on smear microscopy¡ªa method dating from the late nineteenth century¡ªis not sensitive. Many patients with pulmonary TB and all patients with exclusively extrapulmonary TB are missed by smear microscopy, as are most children with active disease. Second, passive case finding relies on the availability of health care services, that is uneven in the settings where TB is most prevalent. Third, patients with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) are by definition infected with strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to isoniazid and rifampin; thus, exclusive reliance on these drugs is ineffective in settings in which drug resistance is an established problem.

The crisis of antibiotic resistance registered in U.S. hospitals is not confined to the industrialized world or to bacterial infections. In some settings, a substantial minority of patients with TB are infected with strains resistant to at least one first-line anti-TB drug. As an effective DOTS-based response to MDR-TB, global health authorities adopted DOTS-Plus, that adds the diagnostics and drugs necessary to manage drug-resistant disease. Even before DOTS-Plus could be brought to scale in resource-constrained settings, however, new strains of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) M. tuberculosis began to threaten the success of TB control programs in already beleaguered South Africa, for example, where high rates of HIV infection have led to a doubling of TB incidence over the last decade.

Tuberculosis and AIDS as Chronic Diseases: Lessons Learned

Strategies effective against MDR-TB have implications for the management of drug-resistant HIV infection and even drug-resistant malaria, which, through repeated infections and a lack of effective therapy, has become a chronic disease in parts of Africa. Indeed, examining AIDS and TB together as chronic diseases makes it possible to draw a number of conclusions, many of them pertinent to global health in general (Fig. 2-2).

First, charging fees for AIDS prevention and care will pose insurmountable problems for people living in poverty, many of whom will always be unable to pay even modest amounts for services or medications. Like efforts to battle airborne TB, such services might best be seen as a public good for public health. Initially, this approach will require sustained donor contributions, but many African countries have set targets for increased national investments in health, a pledge that could render ambitious programs sustainable in the long run. Meanwhile, as local investments increase, the price of AIDS care is decreasing. The development of generic medications means that ART can now cost <$0.25 per day, and costs continue to decrease to affordable levels in developing countries.

Second, the effective scale-up of pilot projects will require strengthening and sometimes rebuilding health care systems, including those charged with delivering primary care. In the past, the lack of health care infrastructure has been cited as a barrier to providing ART in the world's poorest regions; however, AIDS resources, which are at last considerable, may be marshaled to rebuild public health systems in sub-Saharan Africa and other HIV-burdened regions¡ªprecisely the settings in which TB is resurgent.

Third, a lack of trained health care personnel, most notably doctors, is invoked as a reason for the failure to treat AIDS in poor countries. The lack is real, and the brain drain (discussed below) continues. However, one reason doctors leave Africa is that they lack the tools to practice their trade there. AIDS funding provides an opportunity not only to recruit physicians and nurses to underserved regions but also to strengthen health systems by building infrastructure, providing diagnostic and therapeutic resources, and training community health workers to supervise care for AIDS and many other diseases within their communities. Such training should be undertaken even in places where physicians are abundant, since community-based, closely supervised care represents the highest standard of care for chronic disease, whether in the First World or the Third.

Fourth, extreme poverty makes it difficult for many patients to comply with therapy for chronic diseases, whether communicable or not. Indeed, poverty in its many dimensions is far and away the greatest barrier to the scale-up of treatment and prevention programs. It is possible to remove many of the social and economic barriers to adherence, but only with what sometimes are termed "wrap-around services": food supplements for the hungry, help with transportation to clinics, child care, and housing. In many rural regions of Africa, hunger is the major coexisting condition in patients with AIDS or TB, and those consumptive diseases cannot be treated effectively without adequate caloric intake.

Finally, there is a need for a renewed basic-science commitment to the discovery and development of vaccines; more reliable, less expensive diagnostic tools; and new classes of therapeutic agents. This need applies not only to the three leading infectious killers¡ªagainst none of which is there an effective vaccine¡ªbut also to many other neglected diseases of poverty.

Malaria

Chapter 210 reviews the etiology, pathogenesis, and clinical treatment of malaria, the world's third-ranking infectious killer. Malaria's human cost is enormous, with the greatest toll among children, especially African children, living in poverty. An estimated 250 million people have malarial disease each year, and the disease annually kills 1 million people, mostly children under age 5. The poor disproportionately experience the consequences of malaria: 58% of malaria deaths occur in the poorest 20% of the world's population, and 90% are registered in sub-Saharan Africa. The differential magnitude of this mortality burden is greater than that associated with any other disease. Likewise, the morbidity differential is greater for malaria than for diseases caused by other pathogens, as documented in a study from Zambia that revealed a 40% greater prevalence of parasitemia among children under age 5 in the poorest quintile than in the richest.

Despite experiencing the greatest consequences of malaria, the poor are those least able to access effective prevention and treatment tools. Economists describe the complex interactions between malaria and poverty from an opposite but complementary perspective: they delineate ways in which malaria arrests economic development both for individuals and for whole nations. Microeconomic analyses focusing on direct and indirect costs estimate that malaria may consume up to 10% of a household's annual income. A Ghanaian study that categorized the population by income group highlighted the regressive nature of this cost: the burden of malaria represents only 1% of a wealthy family's income but 34% of a poor household's income.

At the national level, macroeconomic analyses estimate that malaria may reduce the per capita gross national product of a disease-endemic country by 50% relative to that of a nonmalarial country. The causes of this drag include high fertility rates, impaired cognitive development of children, decreased schooling, decreased saving, decreased foreign investment, and restriction of worker mobility. In light of this enormous cost, it is little wonder that an important review by the economists Sachs and Malaney concludes that "where malaria prospers most, human societies have prospered least."

Rolling Back Malaria

In part because of differences in vector distribution and climate, resource-rich countries offer few blueprints for malaria control and treatment that are applicable in tropical (and resource-poor) settings. In 2001, African heads of state endorsed the WHO Roll Back Malaria (RBM) campaign, which prescribes strategies appropriate for sub-Saharan African countries. In 2008, the RBM partnership launched the Global Malaria Action Plan (GMAP). This global strategy has set out a coordinated approach to control and eliminate the disease and to ensure that gains in one nation are not lost because of failed control measures in neighboring countries. The GMAP recommends a number of key tools to reduce malaria-related morbidity and mortality rates: the use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) as well as intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy, prompt diagnosis, and other vector control measures such as larviciding and environmental management.

Insecticide-Treated Bed Nets

ITNs are an efficacious and cost-effective public health intervention. A meta-analysis of controlled trials indicates that malaria incidence is reduced by 50% among persons who sleep under ITNs compared with the incidence among those who do not use nets at all. Even untreated nets reduce malaria incidence by one-quarter. On an individual level, the utility of ITNs extends beyond protection from malaria. Several studies suggest that all-cause mortality is reduced among children under age 5 to a greater degree than can be attributed to the reduction in malarial disease alone. Morbidity (specifically that due to anemia), which predisposes children to diarrheal and respiratory illnesses and pregnant women to the delivery of low-birth-weight infants, is also reduced in populations using ITNs. In some areas, ITNs offer a supplemental benefit by preventing transmission of lymphatic filariasis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, Chagas' disease, and tick-borne relapsing fever. At the community level, investigators suggest that the use of an ITN in just one household may reduce the number of mosquito bites in households up to several hundred meters away. The cost of ITNs per DALY saved is estimated at $10¨C$38, which qualifies ITNs as a "very efficient use of resources and [a] good candidate for public subsidy."

The WHO recommends that all individuals living in malaria-endemic areas sleep under protective ITNs. About 140 million long-lasting ITNs were distributed in high-burden African countries in 2006¨C2008, and rates of household ownership of ITNs in high-burden countries increased to 31%. Although the RBM partnership has seen modest success, the WHO's 2009 World Malaria Report states that the percentage of children <5 years of age using an ITN (24%) remains well below the World Health Assembly's target of 80%. Limited success in scaling up ITN coverage reflects the inadequately acknowledged economic barriers that prevent the destitute sick from accessing critical preventive technologies and the challenges in designing and implementing effective delivery platforms for these products.

Indoor Residual Spraying

IRS is one of the most common interventions for preventing the transmission of malaria in endemic areas. Vector control using insecticides approved by the WHO, including DDT, can effectively reduce or even interrupt malaria transmission. However, studies have indicated that spraying is effective in controlling malaria transmission only if most (~80%) of the structures in the targeted community are treated. Moreover, since a successful program is dependent on well-trained spraying teams as well as on effective monitoring and planning, IRS is difficult to employ and is often reliant on health systems with a strong infrastructure that renders the approach feasible. Regardless of the limitations of IRS, the WHO recommends its use in combination with ITNs. Neither intervention alone is sufficient to prevent transmission of malaria entirely.

Artemisinin-Based Combination Therapy

The emergence and spread of chloroquine resistance have increased the necessity for antimalarial combination therapy. To limit the spread of resistance, the WHO now recommends only the use of ACT for uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Like that of other antimalarial interventions, the use of ACT has increased in the last few years, but coverage remains very low in several countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In a 2007¨C2008 study, fewer than 15% of children under the age of 5 with a fever were receiving ACT in 11 of 13 countries surveyed, although the World Health Assembly's target is 80%. In response, the RBM partnership has focused significant investment on enhancing access to ACT by facilitating its delivery through the public-health sector and developing innovative funding mechanisms (e.g., the Affordable Medicines Facility¡ªmalaria) through which consumer prices for ACT can be reduced significantly and ineffective artemisinin monotherapies can be eliminated from the market.

In the last several years, resistance to antimalarial medicines and insecticides has become an even larger problem. In 2009, confirmation of artemisinin resistance was reported. Although the WHO has called for an end to the use of artemisinin monotherapy, the marketing of such therapies continues in many countries. Ongoing use of artemisinin monotherapy increases the likelihood of drug resistance, a deadly prospect that will make malaria far more difficult to treat.

Meeting the challenge of malaria control will continue to require careful study of appropriate preventive and therapeutic strategies in the context of an increasingly sophisticated molecular understanding of the pathogen, vector, and host. However, an appreciation of the economic and structural devastation wrought by malaria¡ªlike that inflicted by diarrhea, AIDS, and TB¡ªon the most vulnerable populations should heighten the commitment to the critical analysis of ways to implement proven strategies for the prevention and treatment of these diseases.

Noncommunicable Chronic Diseases

Although the burden of communicable diseases¡ªespecially HIV infection, tuberculosis, and malaria¡ªstill accounts for the majority of deaths in resource-poor regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, 60% of all deaths worldwide in 2004 were due to noncommunicable chronic diseases (NCDs). Moreover, 80% of deaths attributable to NCDs occurred in low- and middle-income countries, where 86% of the global population lives. In 2005, 8.5 million people in the world died of an NCD before their 60th birthday, a figure exceeding the total number of deaths due to AIDS, TB, and malaria combined. By 2020, NCDs will account for 80% of the GBD and for 7 out of every 10 deaths in developing countries. The recent rise in resources for and attention to communicable diseases is both welcome and long overdue, but developing countries already are carrying a "double burden" of communicable and noncommunicable diseases.

Cardiovascular Disease

Unlike TB, HIV infection, and malaria¡ªdiseases caused by single pathogens that damage multiple organs¡ªcardiovascular diseases reflect injury to a single organ system downstream of a variety of insults. The burden of chronic cardiovascular disease in low-income countries represents one consequence of decades of health system neglect; furthermore, cardiovascular research and investment have long focused on the ischemic conditions that are increasingly common in high- and middle-income countries. Meanwhile, despite awareness of its health impact during the early twentieth century, cardiovascular damage in response to infection and malnutrition has fallen out of view until recently.

The perception of cardiovascular diseases as a problem of elderly populations in middle- and high-income countries has contributed to their neglect by global health institutions. Even in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, where the collapse of the Soviet Union was followed by a catastrophic surge in cardiovascular disease deaths (mortality rates from ischemic heart disease nearly doubled between 1991 and 1994 in Russia, for example), the modest flow of overseas development assistance to the health sector focused on the communicable causes that accounted for <1 in 20 excess deaths during that period.

Predictions of an imminent rise in the share of deaths and disabilities due to NCDs in developing countries have led to calls for preventive policies to restrict tobacco use, improve diet, and increase exercise along with the prescription of multidrug regimens for persons with high levels of vascular risk. Although this agenda could do much to prevent pandemic NCD, it will do little to help those with established heart disease stemming from nonatherogenic pathologies.

The epidemiology of heart failure reflects inequalities in risk factorprevalence and treatment. Heart failure as a consequence of pericardial, myocardial, endocardial, or valvular injury accounts for as many as 1 in 10 admissions to hospitals around the world. Countries have reported a remarkably similar burden of this condition at the health system level since the 1950s, but the causes of heart failure and the age of the people affected vary with resources and ecology. In populations with a high human-development index, coronary artery disease and hypertension among the elderly account for most cases of heart failure. Among the world's poorest billion people, however, heart failure reflects poverty-driven exposure of children and young adults to rheumatogenic strains of streptococci and cardiotropic microorganisms (e.g., HIV, Trypanosoma cruzi, enteroviruses, M. tuberculosis), untreated high blood pressure, and nutrient deficiencies. The mechanisms of other causes of heart failure common in these populations¡ªsuch as idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, peripartum cardiomyopathy, and endomyocardial fibrosis¡ªremain unclear.

Among the 2.4 million annual cases of pediatric rheumatic heart disease, more than 40% occur in sub-Saharan Africa. This disease leads to more than 33,000 cases of endocarditis, 252,000 strokes, and 680,000 deaths per year¡ªalmost all in developing countries. Researchers in Ethiopia have reported annual death rates as high as 12.5% in rural areas. In part because the prevention of rheumatic heart disease has not advanced since the disappearance of this disease in wealthy countries, no part of sub-Saharan Africa has eradicated rheumatic heart disease despite examples of success in Costa Rica, Cuba, and some Caribbean nations.

Strategies to eliminate rheumatic heart disease may depend on active case finding confirmed by echocardiography among high-risk groups as well as efforts to extend access to surgical interventions among children with advanced valvular damage. Partnerships between established surgical programs and areas with limited or nonexistent facilities may help develop capacity and provide care to patients who otherwise would have an early and painful death. A long-term goal is the establishment of regional centers of excellence equipped to provide consistent, accessible, high-quality services.

In stark contrast to the extraordinary lengths to which patients in wealthy countries will go to treat ischemic cardiomyopathy, young patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathies in resource-poor settings have received little attention. These conditions account for as many as 25¨C30% of admissions for heart failure in sub-Saharan Africa and include poorly understood entities such as peripartum cardiomyopathy (which has an incidence in rural Haiti of 1 per 300 live births) and HIV cardiomyopathy. Multidrug regimens that include beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and other neurohormonal antagonists can dramatically reduce mortality risk and improve quality of life for these patients. Lessons learned in the scale-up of chronic care for HIV infection and TB may be illustrative as progress is made in establishing means to deliver heart failure therapies.

Because systemic investigation of the causes of stroke and heart failure in sub-Saharan Africa has begun only recently, little is known about the impact of elevated blood pressure in this portion of the continent. Modestly elevated blood pressure in the absence of tobacco use in populations with low rates of obesity may confer little risk of adverse events in the short run. In contrast, persistently elevated blood pressure above 180/110 goes largely undetected, untreated, and uncontrolled in this setting. In the Framingham cohort of men 45¨C74 years old, the prevalence of blood pressures above 210/120 declined from 1.8% in the 1950s to 0.1% in the 1990s with the introduction of effective antihypertensive agents. Although debate continues about appropriate screening strategies and treatment thresholds, rural health centers staffed by nonphysicians must quickly gain access to essential antihypertensive medications.

In 1960, Paul Dudley White and colleagues reported on the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in the region near the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in Lambar¨¦n¨¦, Gabon. Although the group found little evidence of myocardial infarction, they concluded that "the high prevalence of mitral stenosis [sic] is astonishing. . . . We believe strongly that it is a duty to help bring to these sufferers the benefits of better penicillin prophylaxis and of cardiac surgery when indicated. The same responsibility exists for those with correctable congenital cardiovascular defects." Leaders from tertiary centers in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere have continued to call for prevention and treatment of the cardiovascular conditions of the poor. The reconstruction of health services in response to pandemic infectious disease offers an opportunity to identify and treat patients with organ damage and to undertake the prevention of cardiovascular and other chronic conditions of poverty.

Cancer

Low- and middle-income countries accounted for 54% and 60%, respectively, of the 12.4 million cases and 7.6 million deaths due to cancer in 2008. By 2020, the total number of new cancer cases will rise by 29% in developed countries and by 73% in developing countries. Also by 2020, overall mortality from cancer will increase by 104%, and the increase will be fivefold higher in developing than in developed countries. "Western" lifestyle changes will be responsible for the increased incidence of cancers of the breast, colon, and prostate, but historic realities, sociocultural and behavioral factors, genetics, and poverty itself also will have a profound impact on cancer-related mortality and morbidity rates. Whereas infectious causes are responsible for <10% of cancers in developed countries, they account for 25% of all malignancies in low- and middle-income countries. Infectious causes of cancer such as human papillomavirus (cervical cancer), hepatitis B virus (liver cancer), and Helicobacter pylori (stomach cancer) will continue to have a much larger impact in developing countries. Environmental and dietary factors such as indoor air pollution and high-salt diets also help account for increased rates of certain cancers (e.g., lung and stomach cancers). Tobacco use (both smoking and chewing) is the most important source of increased mortality from lung and oral cancers. In contrast to decreasing tobacco use in many developed countries, the number of smokers is growing in developing countries, especially among women and young people.

For many reasons, outcomes of malignancies are far worse in developing countries than in developed nations. Overstretched health systems in poor countries simply are not capable of early detection; 80% of patients already have incurable malignancies at diagnosis. Treatment of cancers is available for only a very small number of mostly wealthy citizens in the majority of poor countries, and even when treatment is available, the range and quality of services are often substandard. Yet this need not be the future. Only a decade ago, MDR-TB and HIV infection were considered untreatable for all but the wealthiest among the world's population. The last decade has made clear the feasibility of creating innovative programs that reduce technical and financial barriers to the provision of care for complex diseases for the world's poorest populations.

Diabetes

The International Diabetes Federation reports that the number of diabetic patients in the world is expected to increase from 285 million in 2010 to 438 million by 2030. Already, more than 70% of diabetic patients live in developing countries where, because those affected are far more frequently under age 65, the complications of micro- and macrovascular disease take a far greater toll. In 2009, the Federation projected an estimated 4 million deaths from diabetes-related illnesses in 2010, with almost 80% of those deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries.

Obesity and Tobacco Use

In 2004, the WHO released its Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health, which focused on the populationwide promotion of healthy diet and regular physical activity in an effort to reduce the growing global problem of overweight and obesity. Passing this strategy at the World Health Assembly proved difficult because of strong opposition from the food industry and from a number of WHO member states, including the United States. Although globalization has had many positive effects, one negative aspect has been the growth in both developed and developing countries of well-financed lobbies that have aggressively promoted unhealthy dietary changes and increased consumption of alcohol and tobacco. Foreign direct investment in tobacco, beverage, and food products in developing countries reached $327 million in 2002¡ªa figure nearly five times greater than the amount spent during that year to address NCDs by bilateral funding agencies, the WHO, and the World Bank combined.

The Three Pillars of Prevention

The WHO estimates that 80% of all cases of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes as well as 40% of all cancers can be prevented through the three pillars of healthy diet, physical activity, and avoidance of tobacco. Although there is some evidence that population-based measures can have some impact on these behaviors, it is sobering to note that increasing obesity levels have not been reversed in any population, including the populations of high-income countries with robust diet industries. Nonetheless, in Mauritius, for example, a single policy measure that changed the type of cooking oil available to the population led to a fall in mean serum cholesterol levels. Tobacco avoidance may be the most important and most difficult behavioral modification of all. In the twentieth century, 100 million people worldwide died of tobacco-related diseases; it is projected that >1 billion people will die of these diseases in the twenty-first century, with the vast majority of those deaths in developing countries. Today, 80% of the world's 1.2 billion smokers live in low- and middle-income countries, and although tobacco consumption is falling in most developed countries, it continues to rise at a rate of ~3.4% per year in developing countries. The WHO's 2003 Framework Convention on Tobacco Control represented a major advance, committing all of its signatories to a set of policy measures that have been shown to reduce tobacco consumption. However, most developing countries have continued to take a passive approach to the control of smoking.

Environmental Health

In a recent publication that examined how specific diseases and injuries are affected by environmental risk, the WHO determined that ~24% of the total GBD, one-third of the GBD among children, and 23% of all deaths are due to modifiable environmental factors. Many of these factors lead to deaths from infectious diseases; others lead to deaths from malignancies. Increasingly, etiology and nosology are difficult to parse. As much as 94% of diarrheal disease, which is linked to unsafe drinking water and poor sanitation, can be attributed to environmental factors. Risk factors such as indoor air pollution due to use of solid fuels, exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke, and outdoor air pollution account for 20% of lower respiratory infections in developed countries and as many as 42% of such infections in developing countries. Various forms of unintentional injury and malaria top the list of health problems to which environmental factors contribute. Some 4 million children die every year from causes related to unhealthy environments, and the number of infant deaths due to environmental factors in developing countries is 12 times that in developed countries.

Mental Health

The WHO reports that some 450 million people worldwide are affected by mental, neurologic, or behavioral problems at any given time and that ~873,000 people die by suicide every year. Major depression is the leading cause of years lost to disability in the world today. One in four patients visiting a health service has at least one mental, neurologic, or behavioral disorder, but most of these disorders are neither diagnosed nor treated. Most low- and middle-income countries devote <1% of their health expenditures to mental health.

Increasingly effective therapies exist for many of the major causes of mental disorders. Effective treatments for many neurologic diseases, including seizure disorders, have long been available. One of the greatest barriers to delivery of such therapies is the paucity of skilled personnel. Most sub-Saharan African countries have only a handful of psychiatrists, for example; most practice in cities and are unavailable within the public sector or to patients living in poverty. Among the few patients who are fortunate enough to see a psychiatrist or neurologist, fewer still are able to adhere to treatment regimens: several surveys of already diagnosed patients ostensibly receiving daily therapy have revealed that among the poor, few can take their medications as prescribed. The same barriers that prevent the poor from having reliable access to insulin or ART prevent them from benefiting from antidepressant, antipsychotic, and antiepileptic agents. To alleviate this problem, some authorities are proposing the training of health workers to provide community-based adherence support, counseling services, and referrals for patients in need of mental health services.

World Mental Health: Problems and Priorities in Low-Income Countries offers a comprehensive analysis of the burden of mental, behavioral, and social problems in low-income countries and relates the mental health consequences of social forces such as violence, dislocation, poverty, and disenfranchisement of women to current economic, political, and environmental concerns.

Primary Care

At the International Conference on Primary Health Care in Alma-Ata (in what is now Kazakhstan) in 1978, public health officials from around the world agreed on a commitment to "Health for All by 2000," a goal to be achieved by providing universal access to primary health care worldwide. Critics argued that the attainment of this goal by the proposed date was impossible. In the ensuing years, a strategy of selective primary health care emerged that included four inexpensive interventions collectively known as GOBI: growth monitoring, oral rehydation, breast-feeding, and immunizations for diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, polio, TB, and measles. GOBI later was expanded to GOBI-FFF, which also included female education, food, and family planning. Some public health figures saw this as an interim strategy to achieve "health for all," but others criticized it as a retreat from the commitments of Alma-Ata. Similar debates still rage, with "vertical" disease-specific programs for HIV, TB, and malaria often seen as competing with primary health care efforts for critical economic, human, and political resources. Global primary care is examined in detail in Chap. e1.
 
Health Systems and the Brain Drain

A significant and frequently invoked barrier to effective health care in resource-poor settings is the lack of medical personnel. In what is termed the brain drain, many physicians and nurses emigrate from their home countries to pursue opportunities abroad, leaving behind health systems that are understaffed and ill equipped to deal with the epidemic diseases that ravage local populations. The WHO recommends a minimum of 20 physicians and 100 nurses per 100,000 persons, but recent reports from that organization and others confirm that many countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, fall far short of those target numbers. More than one-half of those countries register fewer than 10 physicians per 100,000 population. In contrast, the United States and Cuba register 279 and 596 doctors per 100,000 population, respectively. Similarly, the majority of sub-Saharan African countries do not have even half of the WHO-recommended minimum number of nurses. In addition to these appalling national aggregates, further inequalities in health care staffing exist within countries. Rural-urban disparities in health care personnel mirror disparities of both wealth and health. For instance, nearly 90% of Malawi's population is rural, but more than 95% of clinical officers work at urban facilities, and 47% of nurses work at tertiary care facilities. Even community health workers trained to provide first-line services to rural populations often transfer to urban districts. In addition to inter- and intranational transfer of personnel, the AIDS epidemic contributes to personnel shortages across Africa. Although data on the prevalence of HIV infection among health professionals are scarce, the available numbers suggest substantial and adverse impacts on an already overburdened health sector. A study that examined the fates of a small cohort of Ugandan physicians found that at least 22 of the 77 doctors who graduated from Makerere University Medical School in 1984 had died by 2004¡ªmost, presumably, of AIDS. The shortage of medical personnel in the areas hardest hit by HIV has profound implications for prevention and treatment efforts in those regions. The cycle of health-sector impoverishment, brain drain, and lack of personnel to fill positions when they are available conspires against ambitious programs to bring ART to persons living with both AIDS and poverty. Furthermore, the education of medical trainees is jeopardized as the ranks of the health and academic communities continue to shrink as a result of migration or disease. The long-term implications are sobering.

A proper biosocial analysis of the brain drain confirms that the flight of health personnel¡ªalmost always, as most reviews suggest, from poor to less poor regions¡ªis not simply a question of desire for more equitable remuneration. Epidemiologic trends and access to the tools of the trade are also relevant, as are working conditions in general. In many settings now losing skilled health personnel, the advent of HIV has led to a sharp rise in TB incidence; in the eyes of health care providers, other opportunistic infections also have become insuperable challenges. Together, these forces have conspired to render the provision of proper care almost impossible. One Kenyan medical resident noted, "Before training we thought of doctors as supermen. . . . [Now] we are only mortuary attendants."

In light of the difficult conditions under which these health care personnel work, is it any surprise that the U.S. government's Global AIDS Coordinator remarked in 2004 that there were more Ethiopian physicians practicing in Chicago than in all of Ethiopia? When providing care for the sick becomes a nightmare for those at the beginning of clinical training, physician burnout soon follows among those who carry on in settings of impoverishment. In the public-sector institutions put in place to care for the poorest people, the confluence of epidemic disease, lack of resources with which to respond, and unrealistically high user fees has led to widespread burnout among health workers. Patients and their families are those who pay most dearly for provider burnout, just as they bear the burden of disease and¡ªwith the introduction of user fees¡ªmuch of the cost of responding, however inadequately, to new epidemics and persistent plagues.
 
Conclusion: Toward a Science of Implementation

Public-health strategies draw largely on quantitative methods¡ªepidemiology, biostatistics, and economics. Clinical practice, including internal medicine, draws on a rapidly expanding knowledge base but remains focused on individual patient care; clinical interventions are rarely population-based. In fact, neither public health nor clinical approaches alone will prove adequate in addressing the problems of global health. There is a long way to go before evidence-based internal medicine is applied effectively among the world's poor. Complex infectious diseases such as AIDS and TB have proved difficult but not impossible to manage; drug resistance and a lack of effective health systems have complicated such work. Beyond communicable disease, in the arena of chronic diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease), global health is a nascent endeavor. Efforts to address any one of these problems in settings of great scarcity need to be integrated into broader efforts to strengthen failing health systems and alleviate the growing personnel crisis within these systems.

For these reasons, scholarly work and practice in the field once known as international health and now often designated global health equity are changing rapidly. That work is still informed by the tension between clinical practice and population-based interventions, between analysis and action. Once metrics are refined, how might they inform efforts to lessen premature morbidity and mortality rates among the world's poor? As in the nineteenth century, human rights perspectives have proved helpful in turning attention to the problems of the destitute sick; such perspectives also may inform strategies of delivering care equitably. A number of university hospitals are developing training programs for physicians with an interest in global health. In medical schools across the United States and in other wealthy countries, interest in global health has been exploding. An informal survey at Harvard Medical School in 2006 revealed that nearly one-quarter of the 160 entering students either had significant global health experience or were planning a career in global health. A similar sea change among trainees has been reported at other medical schools. Half a century or even a decade ago, such high levels of interest would have been unimaginable.

Persistent epidemics, improved metrics, and growing interest have only recently been matched by an unprecedented investment in addressing the health problems of poor people in the developing world. This is a moment of opportunity. To ensure that the opportunity is not wasted, the facts need to be laid out for specialists and laypeople alike. More than 12 million people die each year simply because they live in poverty. An absolute majority of these premature deaths occur in Africa, with the poorer regions of Asia not far behind. Most of these deaths occur because the world's poorest do not have access to the fruits of science. They include deaths from vaccine-preventable illness, deaths during childbirth, deaths from infectious diseases that might be cured with access to antibiotics and other essential medicines, deaths from malaria that would have been prevented by bed nets and access to therapy, and deaths from waterborne illnesses. Other excess mortality is attributable to the inadequacy of efforts to develop new preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic tools. Those funding the discovery and development of new tools typically neglect the concurrent need for strategies to make them available to the poor. Indeed, some would argue that the biggest challenge facing those who seek to address this outcome gap is the lack of practical means of distribution in the most heavily affected regions.

The development of tools must be followed quickly by their equitable distribution. When new preventive and therapeutic tools are developed without concurrent attention to delivery or implementation, one encounters what sometimes are termed perverse effects: even as new tools are developed, inequalities of outcome¡ªlower morbidity and mortality rates among those who can afford access, with sustained high morbidity and mortality among those who cannot¡ªwill grow in the absence of an equity plan to deliver the tools to those most at risk. Preventing such a future is the most important goal of global health.

Decision-Making in Clinical Medicine: Introduction

To a medical student who requires 2 hours to collect a patient's history and perform a physical examination and several additional hours to organize that information into a coherent presentation, an experienced clinician's ability to decide on a diagnosis and management plan in a fraction of the time seems extraordinary. What separates the experienced clinician's performance from that of the novice is an elusive quality called "expertise." The first part of this chapter will provide a brief introduction to what is known about the development of expertise in clinical reasoning.

Equally bewildering to the student are the proper use of diagnostic tests and the integration of the results into the patient's clinical assessment. A novice medical practitioner typically uses a "shotgun" approach to testing, hoping to hit a target without knowing exactly what that target is. The expert, in contrast, usually has a specific target in mind and adjusts the testing strategy to it. The second part of the chapter will review briefly some of the crucial basic statistical concepts useful in the interpretation of diagnostic tests. Quantitative tools available to assist in clinical decision-making also will be discussed.

Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the term used to describe the integration of the best available research evidence with clinical judgment and experience as applied to the care of individual patients. The third part of the chapter will provide a brief overview of some of the tools of EBM.

Brief Introduction to Clinical Reasoning

Clinical Expertise

It is surprisingly difficult to define clearly what is meant by "clinical expertise." Chess has its masters, music its virtuoso performers, and athletics its Olympians. But in medicine, once training is complete and the boards are passed, there are no further tests or benchmarks of performance or ability that can be used to identify those who have attained the highest level of abilities in their clinical roles. Of course, there are always a few clinicians who are believed by their colleagues to have special problem-solving abilities: the "elite" who are consulted when particularly difficult or obscure cases have baffled everyone else. But for all their expertise, such doctors typically cannot explain what processes and methods they use to achieve their impressive results. Furthermore, it is not clear that their diagnostic virtuosity can be generalized. In other words, an expert on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be no better (and possibly worse) than a first-year resident at diagnosing and managing a patient with neutropenia, fever, and hypotension.

Broadly construed, clinical expertise includes not only cognitive dimensions and the integration of verbal and visual cues or information but also complex motor skills that are required in the performance of various invasive and noninvasive procedures and tests. In addition, the ability to communicate effectively with patients and work effectively with members of the medical team could be included as important aspects of "the complete package" of expertise in medicine. In this chapter, however, the focus will be on the cognitive elements (clinical reasoning), particularly as they relate to diagnosis. This focus is driven by two factors. First, the most important "actions" in clinical medicine are not procedures or prescriptions but the judgments (both diagnoses and treatment choices) from which all other aspects of medical care flow. Second, although the research on medical expertise is relatively sparse overall, it is best developed in the area of diagnostic decision-making. Much less work has been done on treatment decisions or the technical skills involved in the performance of procedures.

The obvious difficulty involved in the study of clinical reasoning is that it takes place in the heads of doctors and is therefore not readily observable. Further, doctors may not even be aware of how they reason in many cases, and so they may be unable to describe the processes they use. To overcome this difficulty, one line of research has focused on how doctors should reason diagnostically rather than on how they actually do reason. In addition, because of the difficulties of empirical research in this area, much of what is known about clinical reasoning comes from empirical studies of nonmedical problem-solving behavior. The field has been influenced by important work from cognitive psychology, sociology, medical education, economics, informatics, and decision sciences. However, because of this diversity of perspectives, no single integrated model of clinical reasoning exists, and not infrequently, different terms and models are proposed for similar phenomena.

Intuitive versus Analytic Reasoning

One useful contemporary model of reasoning (dual-process theory) distinguishes two general systems of cognitive processes. Intuition (System 1) provides rapid effortless judgments from memorized associations¡ªfor example, African-American women and hilar adenopathy equals sarcoid¡ªor from the reduction of complex data by means of pattern recognition and other heuristics. Typically, the clinician is unable to say how those judgments were formulated. Analysis (System 2), the other form of reasoning in the dual-process model, is slow, methodical, and effortful. These are, of course, idealized extremes of the cognitive continuum. The way these systems interact in different decision problems and the way they differ between experts and novices remain the subject of considerable debate. Much work has also been done to identify how each of these systems can lead to errors in judgment.

Pattern recognition is a complex cognitive process that appears largely intuitive. One can recognize people's faces, the breed of a dog, or the model of an automobile without necessarily being able to say what specific features prompted the recognition. Analogously, an experienced clinician often can recognize the pattern of a diagnosis she or he is very familiar with after a very short amount of time with the patient. The student, who does not have that stored repertoire of diagnostic patterns, must use a more laborious analytic approach along with much more intensive data collection to reach the diagnosis.

The following three brief scenarios of a patient with hemoptysis present three distinct patterns:

A 46-year-old man presents to his internist with a chief complaint of hemoptysis. He is otherwise healthy, is a nonsmoker, and is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. For this patient, the pattern would suggest that the acute bronchitis is responsible for the small amount of blood-streaked sputum the patient has observed. In this case, a chest x-ray may provide sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is not present.
In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient with the same chief complaint who has a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest CT scan.
In the third scenario, a 46-year-old patient with hemoptysis who is from a developing country is evaluated with an echocardiogram as well, because the physician thinks she hears a soft diastolic rumbling murmur at the apex on cardiac auscultation, suggesting rheumatic mitral stenosis.
The primary mistake that can result from relying on the free use of pattern recognition in diagnosis is premature closure: concluding that one already knows the correct diagnosis and therefore failing to complete the data collection that would demonstrate the lack of fit of the initial pattern selected. Consider the following hypothetical example. A 45-year-old male patient with a 3-week history of a "flulike" upper respiratory infection (URI) presented to his physician with symptoms of dyspnea and a productive cough. On the basis of the presenting complaint, the clinician pulled out a "URI assessment form" to obtain patient information that could be beneficial in improving the quality and efficiency of care. The physician quickly completed the examination components outlined on this structured form, noting in particular the absence of fever and a clear chest examination. He then prescribed an antibiotic for presumed bronchitis, showed the patient how to breathe into a paper bag to relieve his "hyperventilation," and sent him home with the reassurance that his illness was not serious. After a sleepless night with significant dyspnea unrelieved by breathing into a bag, the patient developed nausea and vomiting and collapsed. He was brought into the emergency department in cardiac arrest and could not be resuscitated. Autopsy showed a posterior wall myocardial infarction (MI) and a fresh thrombus in an atherosclerotic right coronary artery. What went wrong? The clinician decided, on the basis of the patient's appearance, even before starting the history, that the patient's complaints were not serious. He therefore felt confident that he could perform an abbreviated and focused examination by using the URI assessment protocol rather than considering the broader range of possibilities and performing appropriate tests to confirm or refute his initial hypotheses. In particular, by concentrating on the URI, the clinician failed to elicit the full dyspnea history, which would have suggested a far more serious disorder, and he neglected to search for other symptoms that could have directed him to the correct diagnosis.

Cognitive shortcuts or rules of thumb, sometimes referred to as heuristics, are another type of intuitive mental process that can be invoked to understand how experts solve complex problems of the sort encountered daily in clinical medicine with great efficiency. The original work on the use of heuristics in problem solving was done largely in laboratory experiments on psychology undergraduates. The objective of the research program was to test the statistical intuition of those subjects against the rules of statistics to understand how such intuitions could be biased. Hence, discussions of the use of heuristics in decision-making tend to focus more on ways in which their use can lead to errors in judgment than on their successes. Although there are many heuristics of possible relevance to clinical reasoning, only four will be mentioned here.

When assessing a particular patient, clinicians often weigh the probability that the patient's clinical features match those of the class of patients with the leading diagnostic hypotheses being considered. In other words, the clinician is searching for the diagnosis for which the patient appears to be a representative example; this cognitive shortcut is called the representativeness heuristic. This heuristic is analogous to pattern recognition. However, if there are two (or more) competing diagnoses that could explain the patient's symptoms, physicians who use the representativeness heuristic can reach erroneous conclusions if they fail to consider the underlying prevalence of the two competing diagnoses (i.e., the prior, or pretest, probabilities). Consider a patient with pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, and a low-grade fever. A clinician might consider acute pneumonia and acute pulmonary embolism to be the two leading diagnostic alternatives. Using the representativeness heuristic, the clinician might judge both diagnostic candidates to be equally likely, although doing so would be wrong if pneumonia was much more prevalent in the underlying population. Mistakes also may result from a failure to consider that a pattern based on experience with a small number of prior cases probably will be less reliable than one based on greater experience.

A second commonly used cognitive shortcut, the availability heuristic, involves judgments made on the basis of how easily prior similar cases or outcomes can be brought to mind. For example, an experienced clinician may recall 20 elderly patients seen over the last few years who presented with painless dyspnea of acute onset and were found to have acute MI. A novice clinician may spend valuable time seeking a pulmonary cause for the symptoms before considering and then confirming the cardiac diagnosis. In this situation, the patient's clinical pattern does not fit the expected pattern of acute MI, but experience with this atypical presentation, along with the ability to recall it, can help direct the physician to the diagnosis.

Errors with the availability heuristic can come from several sources of recall bias. For example, rare catastrophes are likely to be remembered with a clarity and force out of proportion to their value¡ªfor example, a patient with a sore throat eventually found to have leukemia or a young athlete with leg pain eventually found to have a sarcoma¡ªand recent experience is, of course, easier to recall and therefore more influential on clinical judgments.

The third commonly used cognitive shortcut, the anchoring heuristic, involves estimating a probability by starting from a familiar point (the anchor) and adjusting to the new case from that perspective. Anchoring can be a powerful tool for diagnosis but may be used incorrectly. For example, a clinician may judge the probability of coronary artery disease (CAD) to be very high after a positive exercise thallium test because the prediction has been anchored to the test result ("positive test = high probability of CAD"). Yet, as discussed below, this prediction would be inaccurate if the clinical (pretest) picture of the patient being tested indicated a low probability of disease (e.g., a 30-year-old woman with no risk factors). As illustrated in this example, anchors are not necessarily the same as the pretest probability (see "Measures of Disease Probability and Bayes' Theorem," below).

The fourth heuristic, which might be termed the simplicity heuristic, states that clinicians should use the simplest explanation possible that will account adequately for the patient's symptoms or findings (Occam's razor). Although this is an attractive and often useful principle, it is important to remember that there is no biologic basis for it.

Experienced physicians use analytic reasoning processes (System 2) much more often when the problem they face is recognized to be complex or to involve important unfamiliar elements or features. In such situations, the clinician proceeds much more methodically in what has been referred to as the hypothetico-deductive model of reasoning. From the outset, the expert clinician is generating, refining, and discarding diagnostic hypotheses. The questions she asks in the history are driven by the hypotheses she is working with at the moment. Even the physical examination is focused on specific questions. Is the spleen enlarged? How big is the liver? Is it tender? Does it have any palpable masses or nodules? Each question focuses the attention of the examiner on the exclusion of all other inputs until it is answered, allowing the examiner to move on to the next specific question. Each diagnostic hypothesis sets a context for the diagnostic steps to follow and provides testable predictions. For example, if the enlarged and quite tender liver felt on physical examination is due to acute hepatitis (the hypothesis), certain specific liver function tests should be markedly elevated (the prediction). If the tests come back normal, the hypothesis may have to be discarded or substantially modified.

Negative findings often are neglected but are as important as positive ones in establishing and refining diagnostic hypotheses. Chest discomfort that is not provoked or worsened by exertion in an active patient reduces the likelihood that chronic ischemic heart disease is the underlying cause. The absence of a resting tachycardia and thyroid gland enlargement reduces the likelihood of hyperthyroidism in a patient with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

The acuity of a patient's illness can play an important role in overriding considerations of prevalence and the other issues described above. For example, clinicians are taught to consider aortic dissection routinely as a possible cause of acute severe chest discomfort along with MI, even though the typical history of dissection is different from that of MI and dissection is far less prevalent (Chap. 248). This recommendation is based on the recognition that a relatively rare but catastrophic diagnosis such as aortic dissection is very difficult to make unless it is explicitly considered as a diagnostic imperative. If the clinician fails to elicit any of the characteristic features of dissection by history and finds equivalent blood pressures in both arms and no pulse deficits, he may feel comfortable discarding the aortic dissection hypothesis. If, however, the chest x-ray shows a possible widened mediastinum, the hypothesis may be reinstated and a diagnostic test ordered [e.g., thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan, transesophageal echocardiogram] to evaluate it more fully. In nonacute situations, the prevalence of potential alternative diagnoses should play a much more prominent role in diagnostic hypothesis generation.

Cognitive scientists studying the thought processes of expert clinicians have observed that clinicians group data into packets, or "chunks," that are stored in their memories and manipulated to generate diagnostic hypotheses. Because short-term memory typically can hold only 7¨C10 items at a time, the number of packets that can be actively integrated into hypothesis-generating activities is similarly limited. For this reason, the cognitive shortcuts discussed above can play a key role in the generation of diagnostic hypotheses, many of which are discarded as rapidly as they are formed (thus demonstrating that the distinction between analytic and intuitive reasoning is arbitrary and simplistic but useful nonetheless).

Research into the hypothetico-deductive model of reasoning has had surprising difficulty identifying the elements that distinguish experts from novices. This has led to a shift from examining the problem-solving process of experts to analyzing the organization of their knowledge. For example, diagnosis may be based on the resemblance of a new case to prior individual instances (exemplars). Experts have a larger store of recalled cases, for example, visual memory in radiology. In the more abstract prototype model of knowledge, clinicians do not simply rely on specific cases but have constructed elaborate conceptual networks or models of disease to arrive at their conclusions. That is, expertise involves an increased ability to connect symptoms, signs, and risk factors to one another; relate those findings to possible diagnoses; and identify the additional information necessary to confirm the diagnosis. More recently, fuzzy trace theory has placed greater emphasis on intuitionism in which expertise involves the ability to distill the "gist" or essence of diagnosis by processing less information and discarding extraneous data with an emphasis on memory and meaning or recognition and retrieval.

Although no single theory has emerged to account for the key features of expertise in medical diagnosis, experts have more knowledge about more things and a larger repertoire of cognitive tools to employ in problem solving than do novices. One definition of expertise highlights the ability to make powerful distinctions. Memorization alone is insufficient; instead, expertise involves a working knowledge of the diagnostic possibilities and what features distinguish one from another. What remains less clear is whether there is any didactic program that would allow the accelerated development of a novice into an expert or ensure the same high level of expertise among more experienced physicians. Some current recommendations include using a combined approach to clinical reasoning, that is, emphasizing to students the importance of both conscious deliberative analytic and intuitive pattern recognition nonanalytic reasoning strategies and thus giving students flexibility in applying any particular reasoning strategy to overcome case-specific weaknesses.

Important Modifiers of Clinical Decision-Making

More than a decade of research on variations in clinician practice patterns has shed much light on the forces that shape clinical decisions. These factors can be grouped conceptually into three overlapping categories: (1) factors related to physicians' personal characteristics and practice style, (2) factors related to the practice setting, and (3) factors related to economic incentives.

Factors Related to Practice Style

One of the key roles of the physician in medical care is to serve as the patient's agent to ensure that necessary care is provided at a high level of quality. Factors that influence this role include the physician's knowledge, training, and experience. It is obvious that physicians cannot practice evidence-based medicine (described later in the chapter) if they are unfamiliar with the evidence. As would be expected, specialists generally know the evidence in their field better than do generalists. Surgeons may be more enthusiastic about recommending surgery than are medical doctors because their belief in the beneficial effects of surgery is stronger. For the same reason, invasive cardiologists are much more likely to refer chest pain patients for diagnostic catheterization than are noninvasive cardiologists or generalists. The physician beliefs that drive these different practice styles are based on personal experience, recollection, and interpretation of the available medical evidence. For example, heart failure specialists are much more likely than generalists to achieve target angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy in their heart failure patients because they are more familiar with what the targets are (as defined by large clinical trials), have more familiarity with the specific drugs (including doses and side effects), and are less likely to overreact to foreseeable problems in therapy such as a rise in creatinine levels or symptomatic hypotension. Other intriguing research has shown a wide distribution of acceptance times of antibiotic therapy for peptic ulcer disease after widespread dissemination of the "evidence" in the medical literature. Some gastroenterologists accepted this new therapy before the evidence was clear (reflecting, perhaps, an aggressive practice style), and some lagged behind (a conservative practice style, associated in this case with older physicians). As a group, internists lagged several years behind gastroenterologists.

An example of the mixed effects on patient outcomes associated with rapid acceptance of new evidence involves the case of adding spironolactone (an aldosterone receptor antagonist) to the drug regimen for patients with systolic heart failure. In a large, well-done clinical trial (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study, RALES) published in 1999, this therapy produced a significant reduction in all-cause mortality rates. Over the next 2 years the use of spironolactone increased fivefold in the province of Ontario, Canada. That rapid uptake was associated with a significant increase in the rates of hospital admission for both hyperkalemia- and hyperkalemia-associated deaths. At least some of these adverse effects of using this "evidence-based medicine" appeared to be related to treatment of patients who would not have been eligible for the RALES trial and who had contraindications to the use of the drug.

The opinion of influential leaders also can have an important effect on practice patterns. That influence can occur at both the national level (e.g., expert physicians teaching at national meetings) and the local level (e.g., local educational programs, "curbside consultations"). Opinion leaders do not have to be physicians. When conducting rounds with clinical pharmacists, physicians are less likely to make medication errors and more likely to use target levels of evidence-based therapies.

The patient's welfare is not the only concern that drives clinical decisions. The physician's perception about the risk of a malpractice suit resulting from either an erroneous decision or a bad outcome creates a style of practice referred to as defensive medicine. This practice involves using tests and therapies with very small marginal returns to preclude future criticism if there is an adverse outcome. For example, a 40-year-old woman who presents with a long-standing history of intermittent headache and a new severe headache along with a normal neurologic examination has a very low likelihood of having structural intracranial pathology. Performance of a head CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan in this situation would constitute defensive medicine. However, the results of the test could provide reassurance to an anxious patient.

Practice Setting Factors

Factors in this category relate to the physical resources available to the physician's practice and the practice environment. Physician-induced demand is a term that refers to the repeated observation that physicians have a remarkable ability to accommodate to and employ the medical facilities available to them. One of the foundational studies in outcomes research showed that physicians in Boston, where the ratio of hospital beds to patients was higher, had an almost 50% higher hospital admission rate than did physicians in New Haven, despite there being no obvious differences in the resulting health or mortality rate of the cities' inhabitants. The physicians in New Haven were not aware of using fewer hospital beds for their patients, nor were the Boston physicians aware of using less stringent criteria to admit patients. In both cities, physicians unconsciously adopted their practice styles to the available level of hospital beds.

Other environmental factors that can influence decision-making include the local availability of specialists for consultations and procedures; "high-tech" facilities such as angiography suites, a heart surgery program, and MRI machines; and fragmentation of care.

Economic Incentives

Economic incentives are closely related to the other two categories of practice-modifying factors. Financial issues can exert both stimulatory and inhibitory influences on clinical practice. In general, physicians are paid on a fee-for-service, capitation, or salary basis. In fee-for-service, the more the physician does, the more he gets paid. The economic incentive in this case is to do more. When fees are reduced (discounted fee-for-service), doctors tend to increase the number of services provided. Capitation, in contrast, provides a fixed payment per patient per year, encouraging physicians to take on more patients but to provide each patient with fewer services. Expensive services are more likely to be affected by this type of incentive than are inexpensive preventive services. Salary compensation plans pay physicians the same regardless of the amount of clinical work performed. The incentive here is to see fewer patients.

In summary, expert clinical decision-making can be appreciated as a complex interplay between cognitive processes used to simplify and organize large amounts of complex information and physician biases reflecting education, training, and experience, all of which are shaped by powerful, sometimes perverse, external forces. In the next section, we will review a set of statistical tools and concepts that can be useful in making clinical decisions in the presence of uncertainty.
 
Interpretation of Diagnostic Tests in the Context of Decision-Making

Despite the great technological advances in medicine over the last century, uncertainty remains a key challenge in all aspects of medical decision-making. Compounding this challenge is the massive information overload that characterizes modern medicine. Today's experienced clinician needs access to close to 2 million pieces of information to practice medicine. According to one estimate, doctors subscribe to an average of seven journals, representing over 2500 new articles each year. Of course, to be useful, this information must be integrated with the specific data collected on each patient being cared for. Although computers appear to offer the obvious solution both for management of information and for better quantitation and management of the daily uncertainties of medical care, many practical problems must be solved before computers can be integrated into the clinician's reasoning process in a way that demonstrably improves the quality of care.

Although a fully-integrated computed-based system of diagnosis and management remains a distant possibility, there are tools available now that can assist in aspects of patient management. In addition, understanding the nature of diagnostic test information can help make a clinician a more efficient user of such data. This section of the chapter will review some important concepts related to diagnostic testing.

Diagnostic Testing: Measures of Test Accuracy

The purpose of performing a test on a patient is to reduce uncertainty about the patient's diagnosis or prognosis and to aid the clinician in making management decisions. Although diagnostic tests commonly are thought of as laboratory tests (e.g., measurement of serum amylase level) or procedures (e.g., colonoscopy or bronchoscopy), any technology that changes a physician's understanding of the patient's problem qualifies as a diagnostic test. Thus, even the history and physical examination can be considered a form of diagnostic test. In clinical medicine, it is common to reduce the results of a test to a dichotomous outcome, such as positive or negative, normal or abnormal. In many cases, this simplification results in the waste of useful information. However, such simplification makes it easier to demonstrate some of the quantitative ways in which test results data can be used.

The accuracy of diagnostic tests is defined in relation to an accepted "gold standard," which is presumed to reflect the true state of the patient (Table 3-1). To define the diagnostic performance of a new test, an appropriate population must be identified (ideally, patients on whom the new test would be used), and both the new and the gold standard tests are applied to all subjects (use of an inappropriate population or incomplete application of the gold standard test may lead to biased estimates of test performance). The results of the two tests are then compared. The sensitivity, or true-positive, rate of the new test is the proportion of patients with disease (defined by the gold standard) who have a positive (new) test. This measure reflects how well the test identifies patients with disease. The proportion of patients with disease who have a negative test is the false-negative rate and is calculated as 1 ¨C sensitivity. The proportion of patients without disease who have a negative test is the specificity, or true-negative, rate. This measure reflects how well the test correctly identifies patients without disease. The proportion of patients without disease who have a positive test is the false-positive rate, calculated as 1 ¨C specificity. A perfect test would have a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 100% and would completely separate patients with disease from those without it.

  Disease Status 
Test Result Present Absent 
Positive True-positive (TP) False-positive (FP) 
negative false-negative (fn) true-negative (tn) 
Identification of patients with disease      
True-positive rate (sensitivity) = TP/(TP + FN)     
False-negative rate = FN/(TP + FN)     
True-positive rate = 1 ¨C false-negative rate     
Identification of patients without disease      
True-negative rate (specificity) = TN/(TN + FP)     
False-positive rate = FP/(TN + FP)     
True-negative rate = 1 ¨C false-positive rate     
 

 

Calculating sensitivity and specificity requires selection of a threshold value or cut point at or above which the test is considered "positive." For any specific test, as this cut point is moved to improve sensitivity, specificity falls and vice versa. This dynamic trade-off between more accurate identification of subjects with disease versus those without disease is often displayed graphically as a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Fig. 3-1). An ROC curve plots sensitivity (y axis) versus 1 ¨C specificity (x axis). Each point on the curve represents a potential cut point with an associated sensitivity and specificity value. The area under the ROC curve often is used as a quantitative measure of the information content of a test. Values range from 0.5 (no diagnostic information from testing at all; the test is equivalent to flipping a coin) to 1.0 (perfect test).

Figure 3-1

 
 
 
Each ROC curve illustrates a trade-off that occurs between improved test sensitivity (accurate detection of patients with disease) and improved test specificity (accurate detection of patients without disease), as the test value defining when the test turns from "negative" to "positive" is varied. A 45¡ã line would indicate a test with no predictive value (sensitivity = specificity at every test value). The area under each ROC curve is a measure of the informa-tion content of the test. Thus, a larger ROC area signifies increased diagnostic accuracy.
 
 

In the testing literature, ROC areas often are used to compare alternative tests that can be employed for a particular diagnostic problem. The test with the highest area (i.e., closest to 1.0) is presumed to be the most accurate. However, ROC curves are not a panacea for evaluation of diagnostic test utility. Like Bayes' theorem (discussed below), they typically are focused on only one possible test parameter (e.g., ST-segment response in a treadmill exercise test) to the exclusion of other potentially relevant data. In addition, ROC area comparisons do not simulate the way test information actually is used in clinical practice. Finally, biases in the underlying population used to generate the ROC curves (e.g., related to assessment of the test in individuals unrepresentative of those in whom the test will be used clinically) can bias the ROC area and the validity of a comparison among tests.

Measures of Disease Probability and Bayes' Theorem

Unfortunately, there are no perfect tests. After every test is completed, the true disease state of the patient remains uncertain. Quantifying this residual uncertainty can be done with Bayes' theorem. This theorem provides a simple mathematical way to calculate the posttest probability of disease from three parameters: the pretest probability of disease, the test sensitivity, and the test specificity (Table 3-2). The pretest probability is a quantitative expression of the confidence in a diagnosis before the test is performed. In the absence of more relevant information, it is usually estimated from the prevalence of the disease in the underlying population. For some common conditions, such as CAD, nomograms and statistical models have been created to generate better estimates of pretest probability from elements of the history and physical examination. The posttest probability, then, is a revised statement of the confidence in the diagnosis, taking into account what was known both before and after the test.

Table 3-2 Measures of Disease Probability

 
 
Pretest probability of disease = probability of disease before test is performed. May use population prevalence of disease or more patient-specific data to generate this probability estimate. 
Posttest probability of disease = probability of disease accounting for both pretest probability and test results. Also called pre-dictive value of the test. 
Bayes' theorem computational version: 
 
Bayes' theorem example: With a pretest probability of 0.50 and a "positive" diagnostic test result (test sensitivity = 0.90, test specificity = 0.90): 
 
 

 

The term predictive value often is used as a synonym for the posttest probability. Unfortunately, clinicians commonly misinterpret reported predictive values as intrinsic measures of test accuracy. Studies of diagnostic tests compound the confusion by calculating predictive values on the same sample used to measure sensitivity and specificity. Since all posttest probabilities are a function of the prevalence of disease in the tested population, such calculations may be misleading unless the test is applied subsequently to populations with the same disease prevalence. For these reasons, the term predictive value is best avoided in favor of the more informative posttest probability.

To understand conceptually how Bayes' theorem estimates the posttest probability of disease, it is useful to examine a nomogram version of Bayes' theorem (Fig. 3-2). In this nomogram, the accuracy of the diagnostic test in question is summarized by the likelihood ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the probability of a given test result (e.g., "positive" or "negative") in a patient with disease to the probability of that result in a patient without disease.

Figure 3-2

 
 
 
Nomogram version of Bayes' theorem used to predict the posttest probability of disease (right-hand scale) using the pretest probability of disease (left-hand scale) and the likelihood ratio for a positive test (middle scale). See text for information on calculation of likelihood ratios. To use, place a straightedge connecting the pretest probability and the likelihood ratio and read off the posttest probability. The right-hand part of the figure illustrates the value of a positive exercise treadmill test (likelihood ratio 4, green line) and a positive exercise thallium single-photon emission CT perfusion study (likelihood ratio 9, broken yellow line) in a patient with a pretest probability of coronary artery disease of 50%. (Adapted from Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine: Likelihood ratios. Available at http://www.cebm.net/index.aspx?o=1043.)
 
 

For a positive test, the likelihood ratio positive is calculated as the ratio of the true-positive rate to the false-positive rate [or sensitivity/(1 ¨C specificity)]. For example, a test with a sensitivity of 0.90 and a specificity of 0.90 has a likelihood ratio of 0.90/ (1 ¨C 0.90), or 9. Thus, for this hypothetical test, a "positive" result is 9 times more likely in a patient with the disease than in a patient without it. Most tests in medicine have likelihood ratios for a positive result between 1.5 and 20. Higher values are associated with tests that are more accurate at identifying patients with disease, with values of 10 or greater are of particular note. If sensitivity is excellent but specificity is less so, the likelihood ratio will be reduced substantially (e.g., with a 90% sensitivity but a 60% specificity, the likelihood ratio is 2.25).

For a negative test, the corresponding likelihood ratio negative is the ratio of the false-negative rate to the true-negative rate [or (1 ¨C sensitivity)/specificity]. The smaller the likelihood ratio (i.e., the closer to 0) is, the better the test performs at ruling out disease. The hypothetical test considered above with a sensitivity of 0.9 and a specificity of 0.9 would have a likelihood ratio for a negative test result of (1 ¨C 0.9)/0.9, or 0.11, meaning that a negative result is almost 10 times more likely if the patient is disease-free than if the patient has disease.

Applications to Diagnostic Testing in CAD

Consider two tests commonly used in the diagnosis of CAD: an exercise treadmill and an exercise single-photon emission CT (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging test (Chap. 229). Meta-analysis has shown that a positive treadmill ST-segment response has an average sensitivity of 66% and an average specificity of 84%, yielding a likelihood ratio of 4.1 [0.66/(1 ¨C 0.84)]. If this test is used on a patient with a pretest probability of CAD of 10%, the posttest probability of disease after a positive result rises to only about 30%. If a patient with a pretest probability of CAD of 80% has a positive test result, the posttest probability of disease is about 95%.

The exercise SPECT myocardial perfusion test is a more accurate test for the diagnosis of CAD. For our purposes, assume that the finding of a reversible exercise-induced perfusion defect has both a sensitivity and a specificity of 90%, yielding a likelihood ratio for a positive test of 9.0 [0.90/(1 ¨C 0.90)]. If we again test the low pretest probability patient and that patient has a positive test, by using Fig. 3-2 it can be demonstrated that the posttest probability of CAD rises from 10 to 50%. However, from a decision-making point of view, the more accurate test may not improve diagnostic confidence enough to change management. In fact, the test has moved the physician from being fairly certain that the patient did not have CAD to being completely undecided (a 50:50 chance of disease). In a patient with a pretest probability of 80%, using the more accurate exercise SPECT test raises the posttest probability to 97% (compared with 95% for the exercise treadmill). Again, the more accurate test does not provide enough improvement in posttest confidence to alter management, and neither test has improved much on what was known from clinical data alone.

Although it depends on the sensitivity and specificity, in general, if the pretest probability is low (e.g., 20%), even a positive result on a very accurate test will not move the posttest probability to a range high enough to rule in disease (e.g., 80%). Pretest probabilities are often particularly low in screening situations in which patients are asymptomatic. In such cases, specificity becomes particularly important. For example, in screening first-time female blood donors without risk factors for HIV, a positive test raised the likelihood of HIV to only 67% despite a specificity of 99.995% because the prevalence was 0.01%. One useful mnemonic is positive SpPin: a positive test with high specificity rules in disease (keeping in mind the caveats just noted about pretest probability). Conversely, with a high pretest probability, a negative test may not rule out disease adequately if it is not sufficiently sensitive. The other mnemonic is negative SnNout: a negative test with high sensitivity rules out disease. Thus, the largest gain in diagnostic confidence from a test occurs when the clinician is most uncertain before performing it (e.g., pretest probability between 30% and 70%). For example, if a patient has a pretest probability for CAD of 50%, a positive exercise treadmill test will move the posttest probability to 80% and a positive exercise SPECT perfusion test will move it to 90% (Fig. 3-2).

Bayes' theorem, as presented above, employs a number of important simplifications that should be considered. First, few tests have only two useful outcomes, positive and negative, and many tests provide numerous pieces of data about the patient. Even if these data can be integrated into a summary result, multiple levels of useful information may be present (e.g., strongly positive, positive, indeterminate, negative, strongly negative). Although Bayes' theorem can be adapted to this more detailed test result format, it is computationally complex to do so. Similarly, when multiple tests are performed, the posttest probability may be used as the pretest probability to interpret the second test. However, this simplification assumes conditional independence¡ªthat is, that the results of the first test do not affect the likelihood of the second test result¡ªand this is often not true.

Finally, it has long been asserted that sensitivity and specificity are prevalence-independent parameters of test accuracy, and many texts still make this statement. This statistically useful assumption, however, is clinically simplistic. A treadmill exercise test, for example, has a sensitivity in a population of patients with one-vessel CAD of around 30%, whereas its sensitivity in patients with severe three-vessel CAD approaches 80%. Thus, the best estimate of sensitivity to use in a particular decision often varies, depending on the distribution of disease stages present in the tested population. A hospitalized, symptomatic, or referral population typically has a higher prevalence of disease and, in particular, a higher prevalence of more advanced disease than does an outpatient population. As a consequence, test sensitivity will tend to be higher in hospitalized patients, whereas test specificity will be higher in outpatients.

Statistical Prediction Models

Bayes' theorem, as presented above, deals with a clinical prediction problem that is unrealistically simple relative to most problems a clinician faces. Prediction models that are based on multivariable statistical models can handle much more complex problems and substantially enhance predictive accuracy for specific situations. Their particular advantage is the ability to take into account many overlapping pieces of information and assign a relative weight to each on the basis of its unique contribution to the prediction in question. For example, a logistic regression model to predict the probability of CAD considers all the relevant independent factors from the clinical examination and diagnostic testing and their significance instead of the small handful of data that clinicians can manage in their heads or with Bayes' theorem. However, despite this strength, the models are too complex computationally to use without a calculator or computer (although this limitation may be overcome once medicine is practiced from a fully computerized platform).

To date, only a handful of prediction models have been validated properly. The importance of independent validation in a population separate from the one used to develop the model cannot be overstated. An unvalidated prediction model should be viewed with the skepticism appropriate for a new drug or medical device that has not been through rigorous clinical trial testing.

When statistical models have been compared directly with expert clinicians, they have been found to be more consistent, as would be expected, but not significantly more accurate. Their biggest promise, then, would seem to be to help less-experienced clinicians become more accurate in their predictions.
 
Formal Decision Support Tools

Decision Support Systems

Over the last 40 years, many attempts have been made to develop computer systems to aid clinical decision-making and patient management. Conceptually, computers offer a very attractive way to handle the vast information load that today's physicians face. The computer can help by making accurate predictions of outcome, simulating the whole decision process, or providing algorithmic guidance. Computer-based predictions using Bayesian or statistical regression models inform a clinical decision but do not actually reach a "conclusion" or "recommendation." Artificial intelligence systems attempt to simulate or replace human reasoning with a computer-based analogue. To date, such approaches have achieved only limited success. Reminder or protocol-directed systems do not make predictions but use existing algorithms, such as guidelines, to guide clinical practice. In general, however, decision support systems have had little impact on practice. Reminder systems, although not yet in widespread use, have shown the most promise, particularly in correcting drug dosing and promoting adherence to guidelines. The full impact of these approaches will be evaluable only when computers are fully integrated into medical practice.

Decision Analysis

Compared with the methods discussed above, decision analysis represents a completely different approach to decision support. Its principal application is in decision problems that are complex and involve a substantial risk, a high degree of uncertainty in some key area, or an idiosyncratic feature that does not "fit" the available evidence. An example decision tree created to evaluate strategies for screening for HIV infection is shown in Fig. 3-3. Infected individuals who are unaware of their illness may cause up to 20,000 new cases of HIV infection annually in the United States. In addition, because of delayed diagnosis, about 40% of HIV-positive patients progress to AIDS within a year of the initial diagnosis. Early identification offers the opportunity both to prevent progression to AIDS through the use of serial CD4 counts and measurements of viral load linked to selective use of combination antiretroviral therapy and to encourage reduction of risky sexual behavior.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) proposed in 2003 that routine HIV testing should be a part of standard medical care. In a decision-model exploration of this proposed strategy compared with usual care, assuming a 1% prevalence of unidentified HIV infection in the population, routine screening of a cohort of 43-year-old men and women increased life expectancy by 5.5 days and cost $194 per subject screened. The cost-effectiveness ratio for screening relative to usual care was $15,078 per quality-adjusted life year (the additional cost to society to increase population health by 1 year of perfect health). Results were sensitive to assumptions about the effectiveness of behavior modification on subsequent sexual behavior, the benefits of early therapy for HIV infection, and the prevalence and incidence of HIV infection in the population targeted. This model, which required over 75 separate data points, provides novel insights into a clinical management problem that has not been subjected to a randomized clinical trial.

Although such models have been developed and used to estimate short- and long-term survival for alternative choices, the process of building and evaluating decision models is generally too complex for use in real-time clinical management. The potential for this tool therefore lies in the development of a set of published or online models addressing a particular decision or policy area that can serve to highlight key pressure points in the problem.
 
Evidence-Based Medicine

The "art of medicine" is defined traditionally as a practice combining medical knowledge (including scientific evidence), intuition, and judgment in the care of patients (Chap. 1). EBM updates this construct by placing much greater emphasis on the processes by which clinicians gain knowledge of the most up-to-date and relevant clinical research to determine for themselves whether medical interventions alter the disease course and improve the length or quality of life. The meaning of practicing EBM becomes clearer through an examination of its four key steps:

Formulating the management question to be answered

Searching the literature and online databases for applicable research data

Appraising the evidence gathered with regard to its validity and relevance

Integrating this appraisal with knowledge about the unique aspects of the patient (including the patient's preferences about the possible outcomes)

Step 1 involves generating well-formulated questions that involve four or five components¡ªPICOD: patient or population, intervention, comparator, outcome, and, sometimes, D for study design, (e.g., does routine percutaneous coronary intervention improve survival compared with initial medical management in 60-year-old men with stable angina and known CAD?) Steps 2 and 3 are the heart of EBM as it is currently used in practice and relate to the underlying fundamental principle that the strength of medical evidence supporting a therapy or strategy is hierarchical. The process of searching the world's research literature and appraising the quality and relevance of studies thus identified can be quite time-consuming and requires skills and training that most clinicians do not possess. Thus, the best starting point for most EBM searches is the identification of recent systematic overviews of the problem in question (Table 3-3).

Generally, the EBM tools listed in Table 3-3 provide access to research information in one of two forms. The first, primary research reports, is the original peer-reviewed research work that is published in medical journals. Initial access to this information in an EBM search may be gained through MEDLINE, which provides access to a huge amount of data in abstract form. However, in using MEDLINE it is often difficult to locate reports that are on point in a sea of irrelevant or unhelpful information and be reasonably certain that important reports have not been overlooked. The second form, systematic reviews, comprehensively summarizes the available evidence on a particular topic up to a certain date and provides the interpretation of the reviewer and thus is the highest level of evidence in the hierarchy. Explicit criteria are used to find all the relevant scientific research and grade its quality. The prototype for this kind of resource is the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. One of the key components of a systematic review is a meta-analysis. The next two sections will review some of the major types of clinical research reports available in the literature and the process of aggregating those data into meta-analyses.

Sources of Evidence: Clinical Trials and Registries

The notion of learning from observation of patients is as old as medicine itself. Over the last 50 years, physicians' understanding of how best to turn raw observation into useful evidence has evolved considerably. Case reports, personal anecdotal experience, and small single-center case series are now recognized as having severe limitations in validity and generalizability, and although they may generate hypotheses or be the first reports of adverse events, they have no role in formulating modern standards of practice. The major tools used to develop reliable evidence consist of the randomized clinical trial and the large observational registry. A registry or database typically is focused on a disease or syndrome (e.g., cancer, CAD, heart failure), a clinical procedure (e.g., bone marrow transplantation, coronary revascularization), or an administrative process (e.g., claims data used for billing and reimbursement).

By definition, in observational data, the care of the patient is not controlled by the investigator. Carefully collected prospective observational data can achieve a level of quality approaching that of major clinical trial data. At the other end of the spectrum, data collected retrospectively (e.g., chart review) are limited in form and content to what previous observers thought was important to record, which may not serve the research question under study particularly well. Data not specifically collected for research (e.g., claims data) often have important limitations that cannot be overcome in the analysis phase of the research. Advantages of observational data include the ability to capture a broader population than is typically represented in clinical trials because of inclusion and exclusion criteria. In addition, observational data are the primary source of evidence for questions for which a randomized trial cannot or will not be performed. For example, it may be difficult or unethical to randomize patients to test diagnostic or therapeutic strategies that are unproven but widely accepted in practice. In addition, patients cannot be randomized to a sex, racial/ethnic group, socioeconomic status, or country of residence. Physicians are also not willing to randomize patients to a potentially harmful intervention, such as smoking or overeating to develop obesity.

The major difference between a well-done randomized clinical trial and a well-done prospective observational study of a particular management strategy is the lack of protection from treatment selection bias in the latter. The use of observational data to compare diagnostic or therapeutic strategies assumes that there is sufficient uncertainty in practice to ensure that similar patients will be managed differently by different physicians. In short, the analysis assumes that there is an element of randomness (in the sense of disorder rather than in the formal statistical sense) to clinical management. In such cases, statistical models attempt to adjust for important imbalances and "level the playing field" so that a fair comparison among treatment options can be made. When management is clearly not random (e.g., all eligible left main coronary artery disease patients are referred for coronary bypass surgery), the problem may be too confounded (biased) for statistical correction, and observational data may not provide reliable evidence.

In general, the use of concurrent controls is vastly preferable to that of historical controls. For example, comparison of current surgical management of left main CAD with left main CAD patients treated medically during the 1970s (the last time these patients were routinely treated with medicine alone) would be extremely misleading since the quality of "medical therapy" has made substantial improvements in the interval.

Randomized controlled clinical trials include the careful prospective design features of the best observational data studies but also include the use of random allocation of treatment. This design provides the best protection against confounding due to treatment selection bias (a major aspect of internal validity). However, the randomized trial may not have good external validity (generalizability) if the process of recruitment into the trial resulted in the exclusion of many potentially eligible subjects.

Consumers of medical evidence need to be aware that randomized trials vary widely in their quality and applicability to practice. The process of designing such a trial often involves a great many compromises. For example, trials designed to gain U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for an investigational drug or device have to address certain regulatory requirements that may result in a trial design different from what practicing clinicians would find useful.

Meta-Analysis

The Greek prefix meta signifies something at a later or higher stage of development. Meta-analysis is research done on research data for the purpose of combining and summarizing the available evidence quantitatively. Although it can be used to combine nonrandomized studies, meta-analysis is used most typically to summarize all the randomized trials on a particular therapeutic problem. Ideally, unpublished trials should be identified and included to avoid publication bias (i.e., "negative" trials may not be published). Furthermore, some of the best meta-analyses obtain and analyze the raw individual patient-level data from all trials rather than working only with what is available in the published reports of each trial. Not all published meta-analyses are reliable sources of evidence on a particular problem. Their methodology must be scrutinized carefully to ensure proper study design and analysis. The results of a well-done meta-analysis are likely to be most persuasive if they include at least several large-scale, properly performed randomized trials. Although meta-analysis can help detect benefits when individual trials are inadequately powered (e.g., the benefits of streptokinase thrombolytic therapy in acute MI demonstrated by ISIS-2 in 1988 were evident by the early 1970s through meta-analysis), in cases in which the available trials are small or poorly done, meta-analysis should not be viewed as a remedy for the deficiency in primary trial data.

Meta-analyses typically focus on summary measures of relative treatment benefit, such as odds ratios or relative risks. Clinicians also should examine what absolute risk reduction (ARR) can be expected from the therapy. A useful summary metric of absolute treatment benefit is the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one adverse outcome event (e.g., death, stroke). NNT is simply 1/ARR. For example, if a hypothetical therapy reduced mortality rates over a 5-year follow-up by 33% (the relative treatment benefit) from 12% (control arm) to 8% (treatment arm), the absolute risk reduction would be 12% ¨C 8% = 4% and the NNT would be 1/.04, or 25. Thus, it would be necessary to treat 25 patients for 5 years to prevent 1 death. If the hypothetical treatment was applied to a lower-risk population, say, with a 6% 5-year mortality, the 33% relative treatment benefit would reduce absolute mortality by 2% (from 6 to 4%), and the NNT for the same therapy in this lower-risk group of patients would be 50. Although not always made explicit, comparisons of NNT estimates from different studies should account for the duration of follow-up used to create each estimate.

Clinical Practice Guidelines

According to the 1990 Institute of Medicine definition, clinical practice guidelines are "systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances." This definition emphasizes several crucial features of modern guideline development. First, guidelines are created by using the tools of EBM. In particular, the core of the development process is a systematic literature search followed by a review of the relevant peer-reviewed literature. Second, guidelines usually are focused on a clinical disorder (e.g., adult diabetes, stable angina pectoris) or a health care intervention (e.g., cancer screening). Third, the primary objective of guidelines is to improve the quality of medical care by identifying areas where care should be standardized, based on compelling evidence. Guidelines are intended to "assist" decision-making, not to define explicitly what decisions should be made in a particular situation, in part because evidence alone is never enough for clinical decision-making (e.g., deciding whether to intubate and administer antibiotics for pneumonia in a terminally ill individual, in an individual with dementia, or in an otherwise healthy 30-year-old mother).

Guidelines are narrative documents constructed by an expert panel whose composition often is determined by interested professional organizations. These panels vary in the degree to which they represent all relevant stakeholders. The guideline documents consist of a series of specific management recommendations, a summary indication of the quantity and quality of evidence supporting each recommendation, and a narrative discussion of the recommendations. Many recommendations have little or no supporting evidence and thus reflect the expert consensus of the guideline panel. In part to protect against errors by individual panels, the final step in guideline construction is peer review, followed by a final revision in response to the critiques provided.

Guidelines are closely tied to the process of quality improvement in medicine through their identification of evidence-based best practices. Such practices can be used as quality indicators. Examples include the proportion of acute MI patients who receive aspirin upon admission to a hospital and the proportion of heart failure patients with a depressed ejection fraction treated with an ACE inhibitor. Routine measurement and reporting of such quality indicators can produce selective improvements in quality, since many physicians prefer not to be outliers.
 
Conclusions

In this era of EBM, it is tempting to think that all the difficult decisions practitioners face have been or soon will be solved and digested into practice guidelines and computerized reminders. However, EBM provides practitioners with an ideal rather than a finished set of tools with which to manage patients. The significant contribution of EBM has been to promote the development of more powerful and user-friendly EBM tools that can be accessed by busy practitioners. This is an enormously important contribution that is slowly changing the way medicine is practiced. One of the repeated admonitions of EBM pioneers has been to replace reliance on the local "gray-haired expert" (who may be wrong but is rarely in doubt) with a systematic search for and evaluation of the evidence. But EBM has not eliminated the need for subjective judgments. Each systematic review or clinical practice guideline presents the interpretation of "experts" whose biases remain largely invisible to the review's consumers. Moreover, even with such evidence, it is always worth remembering that the response to therapy of the "average" patient represented by the summary clinical trial outcomes may not be what can be expected for the patient sitting in front of a physician in the clinic or hospital. In addition, meta-analyses cannot generate evidence when there are no adequate randomized trials, and most of what clinicians confront in practice will never be thoroughly tested in a randomized trial. For the foreseeable future, excellent clinical reasoning skills and experience supplemented by well-designed quantitative tools and a keen appreciation for individual patient preferences will continue to be of paramount importance in the professional life of medical practitioners.

Screening and Prevention of Disease: Introduction

A primary goal of health care is to prevent disease or detect it early enough that intervention will be more effective. Strategies for disease screening and prevention are driven by evidence that testing and intervention are practical and effective. Currently, most screening tests are readily available and inexpensive. Examples include tests that are biochemical (e.g., cholesterol, glucose), physiologic (e.g., blood pressure, growth curves), or radiologic (e.g., mammogram, bone densitometry) or that involve tissue specimens (e.g., Pap smear). In the future, it is anticipated that genetic testing will play an increasingly important role in predicting disease risk (Chap. 63). However, such tests are not widely used except for individuals at risk for high-penetrancegenes on the basis of family or ethnic history (e.g., BRCA1, BRCA2). The identification of low-penetrance but high-frequency genes that cause common disorders such as diabetes, hypertension, and macular degeneration offers the possibility of new genetic tests. However, any new screening test, whether based on genetic or other methods, must be subjected to rigorous evaluation of its sensitivity, specificity, impact on disease, and cost-effectiveness. Physicians and patients are introduced continually to new screening tests, often in advance of complete evaluation. For example, the use of whole-body CT imaging has been advocated as a means to screen for a variety of disorders. Though it is appealing in concept, there is currently no evidence to justify this approach, which is associated with high cost and a substantial risk of false-positive results.

This chapter will review the basic principles of screening and prevention in the primary care setting. Recommendations for specific disorders such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer are provided in the chapters dedicated to those topics.

Basic Principles of Screening

In general, screening is most effective when applied to relatively common disorders that carry a large disease burden (Table 4-1). The five leading causes of mortality in the United States are heart diseases, malignantneoplasms, accidents, cerebrovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Thus, many prevention strategies are targeted at these conditions. From a global health perspective, these conditions are priorities, but malaria, malnutrition, AIDS, tuberculosis, and violence also carry a heavy disease burden (Chap. 2).

Table 4-1 Lifetime Cumulative Risk

 
 
Breast cancer for women 10% 
Colon cancer 6% 
Cancer of the cervix for womena
  2% 
Domestic violence for women Up to 15% 
Hip fracture for white women 16% 
 


aAssuming an unscreened population.
 

A primary goal of screening is the early detection of a risk factor or disease at a stage at which it can be corrected or cured. For example, most cancers have a better prognosis when identified as premalignant lesions or when they are still resectable. Similarly, early identification of hypertension or hyperlipidemia allows therapeutic interventions that reduce the long-term risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events. However, early detection does not necessarily influence survival. For example, in some studies of lung cancer screening, tumors are identified at an earlier stage but the overall mortality rate does not differ between screened and unscreened populations. The apparent improvement in 5-year survival rates can be attributed to the detection of smaller tumors rather than to a real change in clinical course after diagnosis. Similarly, the detection of prostate cancer may not lead to a difference in the mortality rate because the disease is often indolent and competing morbidities, such as coronary artery disease, may ultimately cause mortality (Chap. 82).

Disorders with a long latency period increase the potential gains associated with detection. For example, cancer of the cervix has a long latency between dysplasia and invasive carcinoma, providing an opportunity for detection by routine screening. It is hoped that the introduction of new papillomavirus vaccines will provide additional disease prevention, ultimately reducing reliance on screening for cervical cancer. For colon cancer, an adenomatous polyp progresses to invasive cancer over 4¨C12 years, providing an opportunity to detect early lesions by fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) or endoscopy. In contrast, breast cancer screening in premenopausal women is more challenging¡ªand controversial¡ªbecause of the relatively short interval between development of a localized breast cancer and metastasis to regional nodes (estimated to be ¨C12 months).

Methods of Measuring Health Benefits

It is not practical to perform all possible screening procedures. For example, screening for laryngeal cancer in smokers is not currently recommended. It is necessary to examine the strength of evidence in favor of screening measures relative to the cost and risk of false-positive tests. For example, should ultrasound be used to screen for ovarian cancer in average-risk women? It is currently estimated that the unnecessary laparotomies triggered by finding benign ovarian masses would cause more harm than the benefit derived from detecting the occasional curable ovarian cancer.

A variety of endpoints are used to assess the potential gain from screening and prevention interventions:

The number of subjects screened to alter the outcome in one individual. It is estimated, for example, that 731 women ages 65¨C69 would need to be screened by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and then treated appropriately to prevent one hip fracture from osteoporosis.

The absolute and relative impact of screening on disease outcome. A meta-analysis of Swedish mammography trials (ages 40¨C70) found that ¨C1.2 fewer women per thousand would die from breast cancer if they were screened over a 12-year period. By comparison, ¨C3 lives per 1000 might be saved from colon cancer in a population (ages 50¨C75) screened with annual FOBT over a 13-year period. Based on this analysis, colon cancer screening may actually save more womens lives than does mammography. The impact of FOBT (8.8/1000 versus 5.9/1000) might be stated either as 3 lives per 1000 or as a 30% reduction in colon cancer death; thus, it is important to consider both the relative impact and absolute impact on numbers of lives saved.

The cost per year of life saved is used to assess the effectiveness of many screening and prevention strategies. Typically, strategies that cost <$30,000¨C50,000 per year of life saved are considered "cost-effective" (Chap. 3). For example, using alendronate to treat 65-year-old women with osteoporosis approaches this threshold of approximately $30,000 per year of life saved.

Increase in average life expectancy for a population. Predicted increases in life expectancy for various screening procedures are listed in Table 4-2. It should be noted, however, that the increase in life expectancy is an average that applies to a population, not to an individual. In reality, the vast majority of the screened population does not derive any benefit and possibly incurs a slight risk from false-positive results. A small subset of patients, however, will benefit greatly from being screened. For example, Pap smears do not benefit the 98% of women who never develop cancer of the cervix. However, for the 2% who would develop localized cervical cancer, Pap smears may add as much as 25 years to their lives. Some studies suggest that a 1-month gain of life expectancy is a reasonable goal for a population-based preventive strategy.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) provides recommendations for evidence-based screening (Table 4-3). In addition to these population-based guidelines, it is reasonable to consider family and social history to identify individuals with special risk (www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstfix.htm). For example, when there is a significant family history of breast, colon, or prostate cancer, it is prudent to initiate screening about 10 years before the age at which the youngest family member developed cancer. Screening also should be considered for many other common disorders pending the development of further evidence. Three examples are screening for diabetes (using fasting blood glucose), domestic violence, and coronary artery disease in intermediate-risk asymptomatic individuals.

aScreening is performed earlier and more frequently when there is a strong family history. Randomized, controlled trials have documented that fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) confers a 15¨C30% reduction in colon cancer mortality. Although large randomized trials have not been performed for sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, well-designed case-control studies suggest similar or greater efficacy relative to FOBT.

bIf staff support are available.

cIn the future, Pap smear frequency may be influenced by HPV testing and the HPV vaccine.

Note:Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing is capable of enhancing the detection of early-stage prostate cancer, but evidence is inconclusive that it improves health outcomes. PSA testing is recommended by several professional organizations and is widely used in clinical practice, but it is not currently recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (Chap. 85).

Cost-Effectiveness

Screening techniques must be cost-effective if they are to be applied to large populations. Costs include not only the expense of testing but also time away from work, downstream costs from false-positive results, and other potential risks. When the risk-versus-benefit ratio is less favorable, it is useful to provide information to patients and factor their perspectives into the decision-making process. For example, many expert groups, including the USPSTF, recommend an individualized discussion about prostate cancer screening, as the decision-making process is complex and relies heavily on personal issues. Although the early detection of prostate cancer may seem desirable intuitively, risks include false-positive results that can lead to anxiety and unnecessary surgery. Randomized trials for prostate cancer screening have yielded mixed and relatively modest results. Potential complications from surgery and radiation treatment include erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and bowel dysfunction. Some men may decline screening, whereas others may be more willing to accept the risks of an early-detection strategy. Another example of shared decision-making involves the choice of techniques for colon cancer screening (Chap. 82). In controlled studies, the use of annual FOBT reduces colon cancer deaths by 15¨C30%. Flexible sigmoidoscopy reduces colon cancer deaths by ¨C60%. Colonoscopy offers the same benefit as or greater benefit than flexible sigmoidoscopy, but its use incurs additional costs and risks. These screening procedures have not been compared directly in the same population, but the estimated cost to society is similar: $10,000¨C25,000 per year of life saved. Thus, although one patient may prefer the ease of preparation, less time disruption, and the lower risk of flexible sigmoidoscopy, others may prefer the sedation and thoroughness of colonoscopy.

In considering the impact of screening tests, it is important to recognize that tobacco and alcohol use, diet, and exercise constitute the vast majority of factors that influence preventable deaths in developed countries. Perhaps the single greatest preventive health care measure is to help patients quit smoking (Chap. 395).

Commonly Encountered Issues

Despite compelling evidence that prevention strategies can have major health care benefits, implementation of these services is challenging because of competing demands on physician and patient time and because of gaps in health care reimbursement. Moreover, efforts to reduce disease risk frequently involve behavior changes (e.g., weight loss, exercise, seat belts) or the management of addictive conditions (e.g., tobacco and alcohol use) that are often recalcitrant to intervention. Public education and economic incentives are often useful, in addition to counseling by health care providers (Table 4-4).

A number of techniques can assist physicians with the growing number of recommended screening tests. An appropriately configured electronic health record can provide reminder systems that make it easier for physicians to track and meet guidelines. Some systems give patients secure access to their medical records, providing an additional means to enhance adherence to routine screening. Systems that provide nurses and other staff with standing orders are effective for smoking prevention and immunizations. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have developed flow sheets and electronic tools as part of their "Put Prevention into Practice" program (http://www.ahcpr.gov/clinic/ppipix.htm). Age-specific recommendations for screening and counseling are summarized in Table 4-5.

A routine health care examination should be performed every 1¨C3 years before age 50 and every year thereafter. History should include medication use (prescription and nonprescription), allergies, dietary history, use of alcohol and tobacco, sexual practices, and a thorough family history, if not obtained previously. Routine measurements should include assessments of height, weight (body mass index), and blood pressure, in addition to the relevant physical examination. The increasing incidence of skin cancer underscores the importance of screening for suspicious skin lesions. Hearing and vision should be tested after age 65, or earlier if the patient describes difficulties. Other sex- and age-specific examinations are listed in Table 4-3. Counseling and instruction about self-examination (e.g., skin, breast "awareness") can be provided during the routine examination.

Many patients see a physician for ongoing care of chronic illnesses, and this visit provides an opportunity to include a "measure of prevention" for other health problems. For example, a patient seen for management of hypertension or diabetes can have breast cancer screening incorporated into one visit and a discussion about colon cancer screening at the next visit. Other patients may respond more favorably to a clearly defined visit that addresses all relevant screening and prevention interventions. Because of age or comorbidities, it may be appropriate with some patients to abandon certain screening and prevention activities, although there are fewer data about when to "sunset" these services. The risk of certain cancers, such as cancer of the cervix, ultimately declines, and it is reasonable to cease Pap smears after about age 65 if recent Pap smears have been negative. For breast, colon, and prostate cancer, it is reasonable to reevaluate the need for screening after about age 75. For some older patients with advanced diseases such as severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure and for those who are immobile, the benefit of some screening procedures is low, and other priorities emerge when life expectancy is <10 years. This shift in focus needs to be done tactfully and allows greater focus on the conditions likely to affect quality and length of life.

Principles of Clinical Pharmacology: Introduction

Drugs are the cornerstone of modern therapeutics. Nevertheless, it is well recognized among physicians and in the lay community that the outcome of drug therapy varies widely among individuals. While this variability has been perceived as an unpredictable, and therefore inevitable, accompaniment of drug therapy, this is not the case. The goal of this chapter is to describe the principles of clinical pharmacology that can be used for the safe and optimal use of available and new drugs.

Drugs interact with specific target molecules to produce their beneficial and adverse effects. The chain of events between administration of a drug and production of these effects in the body can be divided into two components, both of which contribute to variability in drug actions. The first component comprises the processes that determine drug delivery to, and removal from, molecular taets. The resulting description of the relationship between drug concentration and time is termed pharmacokinetics. The second component of variability in drug action comprises the processes that determine variability in drug actions despite equivalent drug delivery to effector drug sites. This description of the relationship between drug concentration and effect is termed pharmacodynamics. As discussed further below, pharmacodynamic variability can arise as a result of variability in function of the target molecule itself or of variability in the broad biologic context in which the drug-target interaction occurs to achieve drug effects.

Two important goals of the discipline of clinical pharmacology are (1) to provide a description of conditions under which drug actions vary among human subjects; and (2) to determine mechanisms underlying this variability, with the goal of improving therapy with available drugs as well as pointing to new drug mechanisms that may be effective in the treatment of human disease. The first steps in the discipline were empirical descriptions of the influence of disease X on drug action Y or of individuals or families with unusual sensitivities to adverse drug effects. These important descriptive findings are now being replaced by an understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying variability in drug actions. Thus, the effects of disease, drug coadministration, or familial factors in modulating drug action can now be reinterpreted as variability in expression or function of specific genes whose products determine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Nevertheless, it is often the personal interaction of the patient with the physician or other health care provider that first identifies unusual variability in drug actions; maintained alertness to unusual drug responses continues to be a key component of improving drug safety.

Unusual drug responses, segregating in families, have been recognized for decades and initially defined the field of pharmacogenetics. Now, with an increasing appreciation of common polymorphisms across the human genome, comes the opportunity to reinterpret descriptive mechanisms of variability in drug action as a consequence of specific DNA variants, or sets of variants, among individuals. This approach defines the field of pharmacogenomics, which may hold the opportunity of allowing practitioners to integrate a molecular understanding of the basis of disease with an individual's genomic makeup to prescribe personalized, highly effective, and safe therapies.

Indications for Drug Therapy: Risk versus Benefit

It is self-evident that the benefits of drug therapy should outweigh the risks. Benefits fall into two broad categories: those designed to alleviate a symptom and those designed to prolong useful life. An increasing emphasis on the principles of evidence-based medicine and techniques such as large clinical trials and meta-analyses have defined benefits of drug therapy in broad patient populations. Establishing the balance between risk and benefit is not always simple. An increasing body of evidence supports the idea, with which practitioners are very familiar, that individual patients may display responses that are not expected from large population studies and often have comorbidities that typically exclude them from large clinical trials. In addition, therapies that provide symptomatic benefits but shorten life may be entertained in patients with serious and highly symptomatic diseases such as heart failure or cancer. These considerations illustrate the continuing, highly personal nature of the relationship between the prescriber and the patient.

Some adverse effects are so common and so readily associated with drug therapy that they are identified very early during clinical use of a drug. By contrast, serious adverse effects may be sufficiently uncommon that they escape detection for many years after a drug begins to be widely used. The issue of how to identify rare but serious adverse effects (that can profoundly affect the benefit-risk perception in an individual patient) has not been satisfactorily resolved. Potential approaches range from an increased understanding of the molecular and genetic basis of variability in drug actions to expanded postmarketing surveillance mechanisms. None of these have been completely effective, so practitioners must be continuously vigilant to the possibility that unusual symptoms may be related to specific drugs, or combinations of drugs, that their patients receive.

Beneficial and adverse reactions to drug therapy can be described by a series of dose-response relations (Fig. 5-1). Well-tolerated drugs demonstrate a wide margin, termed the therapeutic ratio, therapeutic index, or therapeutic window, between the doses required to produce a therapeutic effect and those producing toxicity. In cases where there is a similar relationship between plasma drug concentration and effects, monitoring plasma concentrations can be a highly effective aid in managing drug therapy by enabling concentrations to be maintained above the minimum required to produce an effect and below the concentration range likely to produce toxicity. Such monitoring has been widely used to guide therapy with specific agents, such as certain antiarrhythmics, anticonvulsants, and antibiotics. Many of the principles in clinical pharmacology and examples outlined below, which can be applied broadly to therapeutics, have been developed in these arenas.

Figure 5-1

 
 
 
The concept of a therapeutic ratio. Each panel illustrates the relationship between increasing dose and cumulative probability of a desired or adverse drug effect. Top. A drug with a wide therapeutic ratio, i.e., a wide separation of the two curves. Bottom. A drug with a narrow therapeutic ratio; here, the likelihood of adverse effects at therapeutic doses is increased because the curves are not well separated. Further, a steep dose-response curve for adverse effects is especially undesirable, as it implies that even small dosage increments may sharply increase the likelihood of toxicity. When there is a definable relationship between drug concentration (usually measured in plasma) and desirable and adverse effect curves, concentration may be substituted on the abscissa. Note that not all patients necessarily demonstrate a therapeutic response (or adverse effect) at any dose, and that some effects (notably some adverse effects) may occur in a dose-independent fashion.
 
 
 
Principles of Pharmacokinetics

The processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion¡ªcollectively termed drug disposition¡ªdetermine the concentration of drug delivered to target effector molecules.

Absorption

Bioavailability

When a drug is administered orally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, rectally, sublingually, or directly into desired sites of action, the amount of drug actually entering the systemic circulation may be less than with the intravenous route (Fig. 5-2A). The fraction of drug available to the systemic circulation by other routes is termed bioavailability. Bioavailability may be <100% for two reasons: (1) absorption is reduced, or (2) the drug undergoes metabolism or elimination prior to entering the systemic circulation.

Figure 5-2

 
 
 
Idealized time-plasma concentration curves after a single dose of drug.A. The time course of drug concentration after an instantaneous IV bolus or an oral dose in the one-compartment model shown. The area under the time-concentration curve is clearly less with the oral drug than the IV, indicating incomplete bioavailability. Note that despite this incomplete bioavailability, concentration after the oral dose can be higher than after the IV dose at some time points. The inset shows that the decline of concentrations over time is linear on a log-linear plot, characteristic of first-order elimination, and that oral and IV drug have the same elimination (parallel) time course. B. The decline of central compartment concentration when drug is distributed both to and from a peripheral compartment and eliminated from the central compartment. The rapid initial decline of concentration reflects not drug elimination but distribution.
 
 

When a drug is administered by a nonintravenous route, the peak concentration occurs later and is lower than after the same dose given by rapid intravenous injection, reflecting absorption from the site of administration (Fig. 5-2). The extent of absorption may be reduced because a drug is incompletely released from its dosage form, undergoes destruction at its site of administration, or has physicochemical properties such as insolubility that prevent complete absorption from its site of administration. Slow absorption rates are deliberately designed into "slow-release" or "sustained-release" drug formulations in order to minimize variation in plasma concentrations during the interval between doses.

"First-Pass" Effect

When a drug is administered orally, it must traverse the intestinal epithelium, the portal venous system, and the liver prior to entering the systemic circulation (Fig. 5-3). Once a drug enters the enterocyte, it may undergo metabolism, be transported into the portal vein, or undergo excretion back into the intestinal lumen. Both excretion into the intestinal lumen and metabolism decrease systemic bioavailability. Once a drug passes this enterocyte barrier, it may also be taken up into the hepatocyte, where bioavailability can be further limited by metabolism or excretion into the bile. This elimination in intestine and liver, which reduces the amount of drug delivered to the systemic circulation, is termed presystemic elimination, presystemic extraction, or first-pass elimination.

Drug movement across the membrane of any cell, including enterocytes and hepatocytes, is a combination of passive diffusion and active transport, mediated by specific drug uptake and efflux molecules. The drug transport molecule that has been most widely studied is P-glycoprotein, the product of the normal expression of the MDR1 gene. P-glycoprotein is expressed on the apical aspect of the enterocyte and on the canalicular aspect of the hepatocyte (Fig. 5-3); in both locations, it serves as an efflux pump, thus limiting availability of drug to the systemic circulation. P-glycoprotein is also an important component of the blood-brain barrier, discussed further below.

Drug metabolism generates compounds that are usually more polar and, hence, more readily excreted than parent drug. Metabolism takes place predominantly in the liver but can occur at other sites such as kidney, intestinal epithelium, lung, and plasma. "Phase I" metabolism involves chemical modification, most often oxidation accomplished by members of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) monooxygenase superfamily. CYPs that are especially important for drug metabolism (Table 5¨C1) include CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1, and each drug may be a substrate for one or more of these enzymes. "Phase II" metabolism involves conjugation of specific endogenous compounds to drugs or their metabolites. The enzymes that accomplish phase II reactions include glucuronyl-, acetyl-, sulfo-, and methyltransferases. Drug metabolites may exert important pharmacologic activity, as discussed further below.

Clinical Implications of Altered Bioavailability

Some drugs undergo near-complete presystemic metabolism and, thus, cannot be administered orally. Nitroglycerin cannot be used orally because it is completely extracted prior to reaching the systemic circulation. The drug is, therefore, used by the sublingual or transdermal routes, which bypass presystemic metabolism.

Some drugs with very extensive presystemic metabolism can still be administered by the oral route, using much higher doses than those required intravenously. Thus, a typical intravenous dose of verapamil is 1¨C5 mg, compared to the usual single oral dose of 40¨C120 mg. Administration of low-dose aspirin can result in exposure of cyclooxygenase in platelets in the portal vein to the drug, but systemic sparing because of first-pass aspirin deacylation in the liver. This is an example of presystemic metabolism being exploited to therapeutic advantage.

Distribution and Elimination

Most pharmacokinetic processes are first-order; that is, the rate of the process depends on the amount of drug present. Clinically important exceptions are discussed below (see "Principles of Dose Selection"). In the simplest pharmacokinetic model (Fig. 5-2A), a drug bolus (D) is administered instantaneously to a central compartment, from which drug elimination occurs as a first-order process. Occasionally, central and other compartments correspond to physiologic spaces (e.g., plasma volume), whereas in others they are simply mathematical functions used to describe drug disposition. The first-order nature of drug elimination leads directly to the relationship describing drug concentration (C) at any time (t) following the bolus:



where Vc is the volume of the compartment into which drug is delivered and t1/2 is elimination half-life. As a consequence of this relationship, a plot of the logarithm of concentration vs time is a straight line (Fig. 5-2A, inset). Half-life is the time required for 50% of a first-order process to be complete. Thus, 50% of drug elimination is achieved after one drug-elimination half-life, 75% after two, 87.5% after three, etc. In practice, first-order processes such as elimination are near-complete after four¨Cfive half-lives.

In some cases, drug is removed from the central compartment not only by elimination but also by distribution into peripheral compartments. In this case, the plot of plasma concentration vs time after a bolus may demonstrate two (or more) exponential components (Fig. 5-2B). In general, the initial rapid drop in drug concentration represents not elimination but drug distribution into and out of peripheral tissues (also first-order processes), while the slower component represents drug elimination; the initial precipitous decline is usually evident with administration by intravenous but not other routes. Drug concentrations at peripheral sites are determined by a balance between drug distribution to and redistribution from those sites, as well as by elimination. Once distribution is near-complete (four¨Cfive distribution half-lives), plasma and tissue concentrations decline in parallel.

Clinical Implications of Half-Life Measurements

The elimination half-life not only determines the time required for drug concentrations to fall to near-immeasurable levels after a single bolus, it is also the key determinant of the time required for steady-state plasma concentrations to be achieved after any change in drug dosing (Fig. 5-4). This applies to the initiation of chronic drug therapy (whether by multiple oral doses or by continuous intravenous infusion), a change in chronic drug dose or dosing interval, or discontinuation of drug.

Figure 5-4

 
 
 
Drug accumulation to steady state. In this simulation, drug was administered (arrows) at intervals = 50% of the elimination half-life. Steady state is achieved during initiation of therapy after 5 elimination half-lives, or 10 doses. A loading dose did not alter the eventual steady state achieved. A doubling of the dose resulted in a doubling of the steady state but the same time course of accumulation. Once steady state is achieved, a change in dose (increase, decrease, or drug discontinuation) results in a new steady state in 5 elimination half-lives.

Copyright 2003 with permission from Elsevier.]
 
 

Steady state describes the situation during chronic drug administration when the amount of drug administered per unit time equals drug eliminated per unit time. With a continuous intravenous infusion, plasma concentrations at steady state are stable, while with chronic oral drug administration, plasma concentrations vary during the dosing interval but the time-concentration profile between dosing intervals is stable (Fig. 5-4).

Drug Distribution

In a typical 70-kg human, plasma volume is 3 L, blood volume is 5.5 L, and extracellular water outside the vasculature is 20 L. The volume of distribution of drugs extensively bound to plasma proteins but not to tissue components approaches plasma volume; warfarin is one such example. By contrast, for drugs highly bound to tissues, the volume of distribution can be far greater than any physiologic space. For example, the volume of distribution of digoxin and tricyclic antidepressants is hundreds of liters, obviously exceeding total-body volume. Such drugs are not readily removed by dialysis, an important consideration in overdose.

Clinical Implications of Drug Distribution

In some cases, pharmacologic effects require drug distribution to peripheral sites. In this instance, the time course of drug delivery to and removal from these sites determines the time course of drug effects. Digoxin accesses its cardiac site of action slowly, over a distribution phase of several hours. Thus, after an intravenous dose, plasma levels fall, but those at the site of action increase over hours. Only when distribution is near-complete does the concentration of digoxin in plasma reflect the pharmacologic effect. For this reason, there should be a 6¨C8 h wait after administration before plasma levels of digoxin are measured as a guide to therapy. Similarly, anesthetic drug penetration into and removal from the central nervous system (CNS) determines the time course of anesthesia.

Animal models have suggested, and clinical studies are confirming, that limited drug penetration into the brain, the "blood-brain barrier," often represents a robust P-glycoprotein¨Cmediated efflux process from capillary endothelial cells in the cerebral circulation. Thus, drug distribution into the brain may be modulated by changes in P-glycoprotein function.

Loading Doses

For some drugs, the indication may be so urgent that administration of "loading" dosages is required to achieve rapid elevations of drug concentration and therapeutic effects earlier than with chronic maintenance therapy (Fig. 5-4). Nevertheless, the time required for true steady state to be achieved is still determined only by the elimination half-life.

Disease can alter loading requirements: in congestive heart failure, the central volume of distribution of lidocaine is reduced. Therefore, lower-than-normal loading regimens are required to achieve equivalent plasma drug concentrations and to avoid toxicity.

Rate of Intravenous Administration

Although the simulations in Fig. 5-2 use a single intravenous bolus, this is very rarely appropriate in practice because side effects related to transiently very high concentrations can result. Rather, drugs are more usually administered orally or as a slower intravenous infusion. Some drugs are so predictably lethal when infused too rapidly that special precautions should be taken to prevent accidental boluses. For example, solutions of potassium for intravenous administration >20 meq/L should be avoided in all but the most exceptional and carefully monitored circumstances. This minimizes the possibility of cardiac arrest due to accidental increases in infusion rates of more concentrated solutions.

While excessively rapid intravenous drug administration can lead to catastrophic consequences, transiently high drug concentrations after intravenous administration can occasionally be used to advantage. The use of midazolam for intravenous sedation, for example, depends upon its rapid uptake by the brain during the distribution phase to produce sedation quickly, with subsequent egress from the brain during the redistribution of the drug as equilibrium is achieved.

Similarly, adenosine must be administered as a rapid bolus in the treatment of reentrant supraventricular tachycardias (Chap. 233) to prevent elimination by very rapid (t1/2 of seconds) uptake into erythrocytes and endothelial cells before the drug can reach its clinical site of action, the atrioventricular node.

Plasma Protein Binding

Many drugs circulate in the plasma partly bound to plasma proteins. Since only unbound (free) drug can distribute to sites of pharmacologic action, drug response is related to the free rather than the total circulating plasma drug concentration.

Clinical Implications of Altered Protein Binding

For drugs that are normally highly bound to plasma proteins (>90%), small changes in the extent of binding (e.g., due to disease) can produce a large change in the amount of unbound drug, and hence drug effect. The acute-phase reactant 1-acid glycoprotein binds to basic drugs, such as lidocaine or quinidine, and is increased in a range of common conditions, including myocardial infarction, surgery, neoplastic disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and burns. This increased binding can lead to reduced pharmacologic effects at therapeutic concentrations of total drug. Conversely, conditions such as hypoalbuminemia, liver disease, and renal disease can decrease the extent of drug binding, particularly of acidic and neutral drugs, such as phenytoin. Here, plasma concentration of free drug is increased, so drug efficacy and toxicity are enhanced if total (free + bound) drug concentration is used to monitor therapy.

Clearance

Drug elimination reduces the amount of drug in the body over time. An important approach to quantifying this reduction is to consider that drug concentration at the beginning and end of a time period are unchanged and that a specific volume of the body has been "cleared" of the drug during that time period. This defines clearance as volume/time. Clearance includes both drug metabolism and excretion.

Clinical Implications of Altered Clearance

While elimination half-life determines the time required to achieve steady-state plasma concentrations (Css), the magnitude of that steady state is determined by clearance (Cl) and dose alone. For a drug administered as an intravenous infusion, this relationship is:



When drug is administered orally, the average plasma concentration within a dosing interval (Cavg,ss) replaces Css, and the dosage (dose per unit time) must be increased if bioavailability (F) is less than 1:



Genetic variants, drug interactions, or diseases that reduce the activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes or excretory mechanisms may lead to decreased clearance and, hence, a requirement for downward dose adjustment to avoid toxicity. Conversely, some drug interactions and genetic variants increase the function of drug elimination pathways, and, hence, increased drug dosage may be necessary to maintain a therapeutic effect.

Active Drug Metabolites

From an evolutionary point of view, drug metabolism may have developed as a defense against noxious xenobiotics (foreign substances, e.g., from plants) to which our ancestors inadvertently exposed themselves. The organization of the drug uptake and efflux pumps and the location of drug metabolism in the intestine and liver prior to drug entry to the systemic circulation (Fig. 5-3) support this idea of a primitive protective function.

However, drug metabolites are not necessarily pharmacologically inactive. Metabolites may produce effects similar to, overlapping with, or distinct from those of the parent drug. For example, N-acetylprocainamide (NAPA) is a major metabolite of the antiarrhythmic procainamide. While it exerts antiarrhythmic effects, its electrophysiologic properties differ from those of the parent drug. Indeed, NAPA accumulation is the usual explanation for marked QT prolongation and torsades des pointes ventricular tachycardia (Chap. 233) during therapy with procainamide. Thus, the common laboratory practice of adding procainamide to NAPA concentrations to estimate a total therapeutic effect is inappropriate.

Prodrugs are inactive compounds that require metabolism to generate active metabolites that mediate the drug effects. Examples include many angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan, the antineoplastic irinotecan, the anti-estrogen tamoxifen, the analgesic codeine (whose active metabolite morphine probably underlies the opioid effect during codeine administration), and the antiplatelet drug clopidogrel. Drug metabolism has also been implicated in bioactivation of procarcinogens and in generation of reactive metabolites that mediate certain adverse drug effects (e.g., acetaminophen hepatotoxicity, discussed below).

The Concept of High-Risk Pharmacokinetics

When plasma concentrations of active drug depend exclusively on a single metabolic pathway, any condition that inhibits that pathway (be it disease-related, genetic, or due to a drug interaction) can lead to dramatic changes in drug concentrations and marked variability in drug action. This problem of high-risk pharmacokinetics is especially pronounced in two settings. First, variability in bioactivation of a prodrug can lead to striking variability in drug action; examples include decreased CYP2D6 activity, which prevents analgesia by codeine, and decreased CYP2C19 activity, which reduces the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel. The second setting is drug elimination that relies on a single pathway. In this case, inhibition of the elimination pathway leads to striking elevation of drug concentration. For drugs with a narrow therapeutic window, this leads to an increased likelihood of dose-related toxicity. An example is digoxin, whose elimination is dependent on P-glycoprotein; many drugs inhibit P-glycoprotein activity (amiodarone, quinidine, erythromycin, cyclosporine, itraconazole) and coadministration of these with digoxin reduces digoxin clearance, and increases toxicity unless maintenance doses are lowered. When drugs undergo elimination by multiple-drug metabolizing or excretory pathways, absence of one pathway (due to a genetic variant or drug interaction) is much less likely to have a large impact on drug concentrations or drug actions.
 
Principles of Pharmacodynamics

Once a drug accesses a molecular site of action, it alters the function of that molecular target, with the ultimate result of a drug effect that the patient or health care provider can perceive. For drugs used in the urgent treatment of acute symptoms, little or no delay is anticipated (or desired) between the drug-target interaction and the development of a clinical effect. Examples of such acute situations include vascular thrombosis, shock, malignanthypertension, or status epilepticus.

For many conditions, however, the indication for therapy is less urgent, and a delay between the interaction of a drug with its pharmacologic target(s) and a clinical effect is clinically acceptable. Pharmacokinetic mechanisms that can contribute to such a delay include slow elimination (resulting in slow accumulation to steady state), uptake into peripheral compartments, or accumulation of active metabolites. Another common explanation for such a delay is that the clinical effect develops as a downstream consequence of the initial molecular effect the drug produces. Thus, administration of a proton-pump inhibitor or an H2-receptor blocker produces an immediate increase in gastric pH but ulcer healing that is delayed. Cancer chemotherapy very frequently produces delayed therapeutic effects, often long after drug is undetectable in plasma and tissue. Translation of a molecular drug action to a clinical effect can thus be highly complex and dependent on the details of the pathologic state being treated. These complexities have made pharmacodynamics and its variability less amenable than pharmacokinetics to rigorous mathematical analysis. Nevertheless, some clinically important principles can be described.

A drug effect often depends on the presence of underlying pathophysiology. Thus, a drug may produce no action or a different spectrum of actions in unaffected individuals compared to patients. Further, concomitant disease can complicate interpretation of response to drug therapy, especially adverse effects. For example, high doses of anticonvulsants such as phenytoin may cause neurologic symptoms, which may be confused with the underlying neurologic disease. Similarly, increasing dyspnea in a patient with chronic lung disease receiving amiodarone therapy could be due to drug, underlying disease, or an intercurrent cardiopulmonary problem. Thus, the presence of chronic lung disease may alter the risk-benefit ratio in a specific patient to argue against the use of amiodarone.

While drugs interact with specific molecular receptors, drug effects may vary over time, even if stable drug and metabolite concentrations are maintained. The drug-receptor interaction occurs in a complex biologic milieu that can vary to modulate the drug effect. For example, ion channel blockade by drugs, an important anticonvulsant and antiarrhythmic effect, is often modulated by membrane potential, itself a function of factors such as extracellular potassium or local ischemia. Receptors may be up- or downregulated by disease or by the drug itself. For example, -adrenergic blockers upregulate -receptor density during chronic therapy. While this effect does not usually result in resistance to the therapeutic effect of the drugs, it may produce severe agonist¨Cmediated effects (such as hypertension or tachycardia) if the blocking drug is abruptly withdrawn.
 
Principles of Dose Selection

The desired goal of therapy with any drug is to maximize the likelihood of a beneficial effect while minimizing the risk of adverse effects. Previous experience with the drug, in controlled clinical trials or in postmarketing use, defines the relationships between dose (or plasma concentration) and these dual effects and provides a starting point for initiation of drug therapy.

Figure 5-1 illustrates the relationships among dose, plasma concentrations, efficacy, and adverse effects and carries with it several important implications:

The target drug effect should be defined when drug treatment is started. With some drugs, the desired effect may be difficult to measure objectively, or the onset of efficacy can be delayed for weeks or months; drugs used in the treatment of cancer and psychiatric disease are examples. Sometimes a drug is used to treat a symptom, such as pain or palpitations, and here it is the patient who will report whether the selected dose is effective. In yet other settings, such as anticoagulation or hypertension, the desired response can be repeatedly and objectively assessed by simple clinical or laboratory tests.

The nature of anticipated toxicity often dictates the starting dose. If side effects are minor, it may be acceptable to start at a dose highly likely to achieve efficacy and downtitrate if side effects occur. However, this approach is rarely, if ever, justified if the anticipated toxicity is serious or life-threatening; in this circumstance, it is more appropriate to initiate therapy with the lowest dose that may produce a desired effect.

The above considerations do not apply if these relationships between dose and effects cannot be defined. This is especially relevant to some adverse drug effects (discussed in further detail below) whose development are not readily related to drug dose.

If a drug dose does not achieve its desired effect, a dosage increase is justified only if toxicity is absent and the likelihood of serious toxicity is small. For example, some patients with seizures require plasma levels of phenytoin >20 g/mL for optimal anticonvulsant activity. Dosages to achieve this effect may be appropriate, if tolerated. Conversely, clinical experience with flecainide suggests that high dosages (e.g., >400 mg/d) may be associated with an increased risk of sudden death; thus dosage increases beyond this limit are ordinarily not appropriate, even if a higher dosage might seem tolerated.

Other mechanisms that can lead to failure of drug effect should also be considered; drug interactions and noncompliance are common examples. These are situations in which measurement of plasma drug concentrations, if available, can be especially useful. Noncompliance is an especially frequent problem in the long-term treatment of diseases such as hypertension and epilepsy, occurring in 25% of patients in therapeutic environments in which no special effort is made to involve patients in the responsibility for their own health. Multidrug regimens with multiple doses per day are especially prone to noncompliance.

Monitoring response to therapy, by physiologic measures or by plasma concentration measurements, requires an understanding of the relationships between plasma concentration and anticipated effects. For example, measurement of QT interval is used during treatment with sotalol or dofetilide to avoid marked QT prolongation that can herald serious arrhythmias. In this setting, evaluating the electrocardiogram at the time of anticipated peak plasma concentration and effect (e.g., 1¨C2 h postdose at steady state) is most appropriate. Maintained high aminoglycoside levels carry a risk of nephrotoxicity, so dosages should be adjusted on the basis of plasma concentrations measured at trough (predose). On the other hand, ensuring aminoglycoside efficacy is accomplished by adjusting dosage so that peak drug concentrations are above a minimal antibacterial concentration. For dose adjustment of other drugs (e.g., anticonvulsants), concentration should be measured at its lowest during the dosing interval, just prior to a dose at steady state (Fig. 5-4), to ensure a maintained therapeutic effect.

Concentration of Drugs in Plasma as a Guide to Therapy

Factors such as interactions with other drugs, disease-induced alterations in elimination and distribution, and genetic variation in drug disposition combine to yield a wide range of plasma levels in patients given the same dose. Hence, if a predictable relationship can be established between plasma drug concentration and beneficial or adverse drug effect, measurement of plasma levels can provide a valuable tool to guide selection of an optimal dose. This is particularly true when there is a narrow range between the plasma levels yielding therapeutic and adverse effects, as with digoxin, theophylline, some antiarrhythmics, aminoglycosides, cyclosporine, and anticonvulsants. By contrast, if no such relationship can be established (e.g., if drug access to important sites of action outside plasma is highly variable), monitoring plasma concentration may not provide an accurate guide to therapy (Fig. 5-5A).

Figure 5-5

 
 
 
 
A. The efflux pump P-glycoprotein excludes drugs from the endothelium of capillaries in the brain, and so constitutes a key element of the blood-brain barrier. Thus, reduced P-glycoprotein function (e.g., due to drug interactions or genetically determined variability in gene transcription) increases penetration of substrate drugs into the brain, even when plasma concentrations are unchanged. B. The graph shows an effect of a 1-receptor polymorphism on receptor function in vitro. Patients with the hypofunctional variant (red) may display lesser heart-rate slowing or blood pressure lowering on exposure to a receptor blocking agent.
 
 

The common situation of first-order elimination implies that average, maximum, and minimum steady-state concentrations are related linearly to the dosing rate. Accordingly, the maintenance dose may be adjusted on the basis of the ratio between the desired and measured concentrations at steady state; for example, if a doubling of the steady-state plasma concentration is desired, the dose should be doubled. In some cases, elimination becomes saturated at high doses, and the process then occurs at a fixed amount per unit time (zero order). For drugs with this property (e.g., phenytoin and theophylline), plasma concentrations change disproportionately more than the alteration in the dosing rate. In this situation, changes in dose should be small to minimize the degree of unpredictability, and plasma concentration monitoring should be used when available to ensure that dose modification achieves the desired level.

An increase in dosage is usually best achieved by changing the drug dose but not the dosing interval, e.g., by giving 200 mg every 8 h instead of 100 mg every 8 h. However, this approach is acceptable only if the resulting maximum concentration is not toxic and the trough value does not fall below the minimum effective concentration for an undesirable period of time. Alternatively, the steady state may be changed by altering the frequency of intermittent dosing but not the size of each dose. In this case, the magnitude of the fluctuations around the average steady-state level will change¡ªthe shorter the dosing interval, the smaller the difference between peak and trough levels.
 
Effects of Disease on Drug Concentration and Response

Renal Disease

Renal excretion of parent drug and metabolites is generally accomplished by glomerular filtration and by specific drug transporters, only now being identified. If a drug or its metabolites are primarily excreted through the kidneys and increased drug levels are associated with adverse effects, drug dosages must be reduced in patients with renal dysfunction to avoid toxicity. The antiarrhythmics dofetilide and sotalol undergo predominant renal excretion and carry a risk of QT prolongation and arrhythmias if doses are not reduced in renal disease. Thus, in end-stage renal disease, sotalol can be given as 40 mg after dialysis (every second day), compared to the usual daily dose, 80¨C120 mg every 12 h. The narcotic analgesic meperidine undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, so that renal failure has little effect on its plasma concentration. However, its metabolite, normeperidine, does undergo renal excretion, accumulates in renal failure, and probably accounts for the signs of CNS excitation, such as irritability, twitching, and seizures, that appear when multiple doses of meperidine are administered to patients with renal disease. Protein binding of some drugs (e.g., phenytoin) may be altered in uremia, so measuring free drug concentration may be desirable.

In non-end-stage renal disease, changes in renal drug clearance are generally proportional to those in creatinine clearance, which may be measured directly or estimated from the serum creatinine (Chap. 278). This estimate, coupled with the knowledge of how much drug is normally excreted renally vs nonrenally, allows an estimate of the dose adjustment required. In practice, most decisions involving dosing adjustment in patients with renal failure use published recommended adjustments in dosage or dosing interval based on the severity of renal dysfunction indicated by creatinine clearance. Any such modification of dose is a first approximation and should be followed by plasma concentration data (if available) and clinical observation to further optimize therapy for the individual patient.

Liver Disease

In contrast to the predictable decline in renal clearance of drugs in renal insufficiency, the effects of diseases like hepatitis or cirrhosis on drug disposition range from impaired to increased drug clearance in an unpredictable fashion. Standard tests of liver function are not useful in adjusting doses. First-pass metabolism may decrease, leading to increased oral bioavailability as a consequence of disrupted hepatocyte function, altered liver architecture, and portacaval shunts. The oral bioavailability for high first-pass drugs such as morphine, meperidine, midazolam, and nifedipine is almost doubled in patients with cirrhosis, compared to those with normal liver function. Therefore, the size of the oral dose of such drugs should be reduced in this setting.

Heart Failure and Shock

Under conditions of decreased tissue perfusion, the cardiac output is redistributed to preserve blood flow to the heart and brain at the expense of other tissues (Chap. 234). As a result, drugs may be distributed into a smaller volume of distribution, higher drug concentrations will be present in the plasma, and the tissues that are best perfused (the brain and heart) will be exposed to these higher concentrations. If either the brain or heart is sensitive to the drug, an alteration in response will occur. As well, decreased perfusion of the kidney and liver may impair drug clearance. Another consequence of severe heart failure is decreased gut perfusion, which may reduce drug absorption and, thus, lead to reduced or absent effects of orally administered therapies.

Drug Use in the Elderly

In the elderly, multiple pathologies and medications used to treat them result in more drug interactions and adverse effects. Aging also results in changes in organ function, especially of the organs involved in drug disposition. Initial doses should be less than the usual adult dosage and should be increased slowly. The number of medications, and doses per day, should be kept as low as possible.

Even in the absence of kidney disease, renal clearance may be reduced by 35¨C50% in elderly patients. Dosage adjustments are therefore necessary for drugs that are eliminated mainly by the kidneys. Because muscle mass and therefore creatinine production are reduced in older individuals, a normal serum creatinine concentration can be present even though creatinine clearance is impaired; dosages should be adjusted on the basis of creatinine clearance, as discussed above. Aging also results in a decrease in the size of, and blood flow to, the liver and possibly in the activity of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes; accordingly, the hepatic clearance of some drugs is impaired in the elderly. As with liver disease, these changes are not readily predicted.

Elderly patients may display altered drug sensitivity. Examples include increased analgesic effects of opioids, increased sedation from benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants, and increased risk of bleeding while receiving anticoagulant therapy, even when clotting parameters are well controlled. Exaggerated responses to cardiovascular drugs are also common because of the impaired responsiveness of normal homeostatic mechanisms. Conversely, the elderly display decreased sensitivity to -adrenergic receptor blockers.

Adverse drug reactions are especially common in the elderly because of altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, the frequent use of multidrug regimens, and concomitant disease. For example, use of long half-life benzodiazepines is linked to the occurrence of hip fractures in elderly patients, perhaps reflecting both a risk of falls from these drugs (due to increased sedation) and the increased incidence of osteoporosis in elderly patients. In population surveys of the noninstitutionalized elderly, as many as 10% had at least one adverse drug reaction in the previous year.
 
Genetic Determinants of the Response to Drugs

Principles of Genetic Variation and Human Traits

(See also Chaps. 61 and 63) The concept that genetically determined variations in drug metabolism might be associated with variable drug levels and hence, effect, was advanced at the end of the nineteenth century, and the examples of familial clustering of unusual drug responses were noted in the mid-twentieth century. Variants in the human genome resulting in variation in level of expression or function of molecules important for pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are increasingly recognized. These may be mutations (very rare variants, often associated with disease) or polymorphisms, variants that are much more common in a population. Variants may occur at a single nucleotide [single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)] or involve insertion or deletion of one or more nucleotides, occasionally up to thousands. They may be in the exons (coding regions), introns (noncoding intervening sequences), or intergenic regions. Exonic polymorphisms may or may not alter the encoded protein, and variant proteins may or may not display altered function. Similarly, polymorphisms in noncoding regions may or may not alter gene expression and protein level.

As variation in the human genome is increasingly well documented, associations are being described between polymorphisms and various traits (including response to drug therapy). Some of these rely on well-developed chains of evidence, including in vitro studies demonstrating variant protein function, familial aggregation of the variant allele with the trait, and association studies in large populations. In other cases, the associations are less compelling. Identifying replicated associations with important clinical consequences is a challenge that must be overcome before the concept of genotyping to identify optimal drugs (or dosages) in individual patients prior to prescribing can be considered for widespread clinical practice.

Rates of drug efficacy and adverse effects often vary among ethnic groups. Many explanations for such differences are plausible; genomic approaches have now established one mechanism that functionally important variants determining differences in drug response often display differing distributions among ethnic groups. This finding may have importance for drug use among ethnic groups, as well as in drug development.

Approaches to Identifying Genetic Variants Modulating Drug Action

A goal of traditional Mendelian genetics is to identify DNA variants associated with a distinct phenotype in multiple related family members (Chap. 63). The usual approach, linkage analysis, does not generally lend itself to identifying genetic variants contributing to variable drug actions, because it is unusual for a drug response phenotype to be accurately measured in more than one family member, let alone across a kindred. Thus, alternate approaches are used to identify and validate DNA variants contributing to variable drug actions.

Most studies to date have used an understanding of the molecular mechanisms modulating drug action to identify candidate genes in which variants could explain variable drug responses. One very common scenario is that variable drug actions can be attributed to variability in plasma drug concentrations. When plasma drug concentrations vary widely (e.g., more than an order of magnitude), especially if their distribution is nonunimodal as in Fig. 5-6, variants in single genes controlling drug concentrations often contribute. In this case, the most obvious candidate genes are those responsible for drug metabolism and elimination. Other candidate genes are those encoding the target molecules with which drugs interact to produce their effects or molecules modulating that response, including those involved in disease pathogenesis.

Figure 5-6

 
 
 
 
A. CYP2D6 metabolic activity was assessed in 290 subjects by administration of a test dose of a probe substrate and measurement of urinary formation of the CYP2D6-generated metabolite. The heavy arrow indicates a clear antimode, separating poor metabolizer subjects (PMs, green), with two loss-of-function CYP2D6 alleles, indicated by the intron-exon structures below the bar chart. Individuals with one or two functional alleles are grouped together as extensive metabolizers (EMs, blue). Also shown are ultra-rapid metabolizers (UMs), with 2¨C12 functional copies of the gene (red), displaying the greatest enzyme activity. (Adapted by permission from M-L Dahl et al: J Pharmacol Exp Ther 274:516, 1995.) B. These simulations show the predicted effects of CYP2D6 genotype on disposi-tion of a substrate drug. With a single dose (left), there is an inverse "gene-dose" relationship between the number of active alleles and the areas under the time-concentration curves (smallest in UM subjects; highest in PM subjects); this indicates that clearance is greatest in UM subjects. In addition, elimination half-life is longest in PM subjects. The right panel shows that these single dose differences are exaggerated during chronic therapy: steady-state concentration is much higher in PM subjects (decreased clearance), as is the time required to achieve steady state (longer elimination half-life).
 
 

The field has also had some success with "unbiased" approaches such as genome-wide association (GWA) (Chap. 61). GWA makes no a priori assumptions about the genetic loci modulating variable drug response and, instead, searches across the whole genome in an "unbiased fashion" to identify loci linked to variable drug response.

Genetically Determined Drug Disposition and Variable Effects

Clinically important genetic variants have been described in multiple molecular pathways of drug disposition (Table 5¨C2). A distinct multimodal distribution of drug disposition (as shown in Fig. 5-6) argues for a predominant effect of variants in a single gene in the metabolism of that substrate. Individuals with two alleles (variants) encoding for nonfunctional protein make up one group, often termed poor metabolizers (PM phenotype); many variants can produce such a loss of function, complicating the use of genotyping in clinical practice. Individuals with one functional allele make up a second (intermediate metabolizers) and may or may not be distinguishable from those with two functional alleles (extensive metabolizers, EMs). Ultra-rapid metabolizers with especially high enzymatic activity (occasionally due to gene duplication; Fig. 5-6) have also been described for some traits. Many drugs in widespread use can inhibit specific drug disposition pathways (Table 5¨C1), and so EM individuals receiving such inhibitors can respond like PM patients (phenocopying). Polymorphisms in genes encoding drug uptake or drug efflux transporters may be other contributors to variability in drug delivery to target sites and, hence, in drug effects.

CYP Variants

CYP3A4 is the most abundant hepatic and intestinal CYP and is also the enzyme responsible for metabolism of the greatest number of drugs in therapeutic use. CYP3A4 activity is highly variable (up to an order of magnitude) among individuals, but the underlying mechanisms are not yet well understood. A closely related gene, encoding CYP3A5 (which shares substrates with CYP3A4), does display loss-of-function variants, especially in African populations. CYP3A refers to both enzymes.

CYP2D6 is second to CYP3A4 in the number of commonly used drugs that it metabolizes. CYP2D6 activity is polymorphically distributed, with about 7% of European- and African-derived populations (but very few Asians) displaying the PM phenotype (Fig. 5-6). Dozens of loss-of-function variants in the CYP2D6 gene have been described; the PM phenotype arises in individuals with two such alleles. In addition, ultra-rapid metabolizers with multiple functional copies of the CYP2D6 gene have been identified, particularly in Ethiopian, Eritrean, and Saudi individuals.

Codeine is biotransformed by CYP2D6 to the potent active metabolite morphine, so its effects are blunted in PMs and exaggerated in ultra-rapid metabolizers. In the case of drugs with beta-blocking properties metabolized by CYP2D6, greater signs of beta blockade (e.g., bradycardia) are seen in PM subjects than in EMs. This can be seen not only with orally administered beta blockers such as metoprolol and carvedilol, but also with ophthalmic timolol and with the sodium channel¨Cblocking antiarrhythmic propafenone, a CYP2D6 substrate with beta-blocking properties. Further, in EM subjects, propafenone elimination becomes zero-order at higher doses; so, for example, a tripling of the dose may lead to a tenfold increase in drug concentration. Ultra-rapid metabolizers may require very high dosages of tricyclic antidepressants to achieve a therapeutic effect and, with codeine, may display transient euphoria and nausea due to very rapid generation of morphine. Tamoxifen undergoes CYP2D6-mediated biotransformation to an active metabolite, so its efficacy may be in part related to this polymorphism. In addition, the widespread use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to treat tamoxifen-related hot flashes may also alter the drug's effects because many SSRIs, notably fluoxetine and paroxetine, are also CYP2D6 inhibitors.

The PM phenotype for CYP2C19 is common (20%) among Asians and rarer (3¨C5%) in European-derived populations. The impact of polymorphic CYP2C19-mediated metabolism has been demonstrated with the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole, where ulcer cure rates with "standard" dosages were markedly lower in EM patients (29%) than in PMs (100%). Thus, understanding the importance of this polymorphism would have been important in developing the drug, and knowing a patient's CYP2C19 genotype should improve therapy. CYP2C19 is responsible for bioactivation of the antiplatelet drug clopidogrel, and several large studies have documented decreased efficacy (e.g., increased myocardial infarction after placement of coronary stents) among Caucasian subjects with reduction of function alleles. In addition, some studies suggest that omeprazole and possibly other proton inhibitors phenocopy this effect.

There are common allelic variants of CYP2C9 that encode proteins with loss of catalytic function. These variant alleles are associated with increased rates of neurologic complications with phenytoin, hypoglycemia with glipizide, and reduced warfarin dose required to maintain stable anticoagulation (discussed further below). The angiotensin-receptor blocker losartan is a prodrug that is bioactivated by CYP2C9; as a result, PMs and those receiving inhibitor drugs may display little response to therapy.

Transferase Variants

One of the most extensively studied phase II polymorphisms is the PM trait for thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT). TPMT bioinactivates the antileukemic drug 6-mercaptopurine. Further, 6-mercaptopurine is itself an active metabolite of the immunosuppressive azathioprine. Homozygotes for alleles encoding the inactive TPMT (1 in 300 individuals) predictably exhibit severe and potentially fatal pancytopenia on standard doses of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine. On the other hand, homozygotes for fully functional alleles may display less anti-inflammatory or antileukemic effect with the drugs.

N-acetylation is catalyzed by hepatic N-acetyl transferase (NAT), which represents the activity of two genes, NAT-1 and NAT-2. Both enzymes transfer an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A to the drug; NAT-1 activity is generally constant, while polymorphisms in NAT-2 result in individual differences in the rate at which drugs are acetylated and thus define "rapid acetylators" and "slow acetylators." Slow acetylators make up 50% of European- and African-derived populations but are less common among Asians.

Slow acetylators have an increased incidence of the drug-induced lupus syndrome during procainamide and hydralazine therapy and of hepatitis with isoniazid. Induction of CYPs (e.g., by rifampin) also increases the risk of isoniazid-related hepatitis, likely reflecting generation of reactive metabolites of acetylhydrazine, itself an isoniazid metabolite.

Individuals homozygous for a common promoter polymorphism that reduces transcription of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) have benign hyperbilirubinemia (Gilbert's syndrome; Chap. 302). This variant has also been associated with diarrhea and increased bone marrow depression with the antineoplastic prodrug irinotecan, whose active metabolite is normally detoxified by UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation.

Variability in the Molecular Targets with Which Drugs Interact

Multiple polymorphisms identified in the 2-adrenergic receptor appear to be linked to specific phenotypes in asthma and congestive heart failure, diseases in which 2-receptor function might be expected to determine prognosis. Polymorphisms in the 2-receptor gene have also been associated with response to inhaled 2-receptor agonists, while those in the 1-adrenergic receptor gene have been associated with variability in heart rate slowing and blood pressure lowering (Fig. 5-5B). In addition, in heart failure, a common polymorphism in the 1-adrenergic receptor gene has been implicated in variable clinical outcome during therapy with the investigational beta blocker bucindolol. Response to the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton in asthma has been linked to polymorphisms that determine the expression level of the 5-lipoxygenase gene.

Drugs may also interact with genetic pathways of disease to elicit or exacerbate symptoms of the underlying conditions. In the porphyrias, CYP inducers are thought to increase the activity of enzymes proximal to the deficient enzyme, exacerbating or triggering attacks (Chap. 358). Deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), most often in individuals of African, Mediterranean, or South Asian descent, increases risk of hemolytic anemia in response to primaquine and a number of other drugs that do not cause hemolysis in patients with normal amounts of the enzyme (Chap. 106). Patients with mutations in the ryanodine receptor, which controls intracellular calcium in skeletal muscle and other tissues, may be asymptomatic until exposed to certain general anesthetics, which trigger the syndrome of malignant hyperthermia. Certain antiarrhythmics and other drugs can produce marked QT prolongation and torsades des pointes (Chap. 233), and in some patients this adverse effect represents unmasking of previously subclinical congenital long QT syndrome.

Tumor and Infectious Agent Genomes

The actions of drugs used to treat infectious or neoplastic disease may be modulated by variants in these non-human germline genomes. Genotyping tumors is a rapidly evolving approach to target therapies to underlying mechanisms and to avoid potentially toxic therapy in patients who would derive no benefit (Chap. 83). Trastuzumab, which potentiates anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity, is ineffective in breast cancers that do not express the herceptin receptor. Imatinib targets a specific tyrosine kinase, BCR-Abl1, that is generated by the translocation that creates the Philadelphia chromosome typical of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). BCR-Abl1 is not only active but may be central to the pathogenesis of CML; its use in BCR-Abl1-positive tumors has resulted in remarkable antitumor efficacy. Similarly, the antiepidermal growth factor (EGFR) antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab appear especially effective in colon cancers in which K-ras, a G-protein in the EGFR pathway, is not mutated.

Polymorphisms that Modulate the Biologic Context Within Which the Drug-Target Interactions Occur

The interaction of a drug with its molecular target is translated into a clinical action in a complex biologic milieu that is itself often perturbed by disease. Thus, polymorphisms that determine variability in this biology may profoundly influence drug response, although the genes involved are not themselves directly targets of drug action. Polymorphisms in genes important for lipid homeostasis (such as the ABCA1 transporter and the cholesterol ester transport protein) modulate response to 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, "statins." In one large study, the combination of diuretic use combined with a variant in the adducin gene (encoding a cytoskeletal protein important for renal tubular sodium absorption) decreased stroke or myocardial infarction risk, while neither factor alone had an effect. Common polymorphisms in ion channel genes that are not themselves the target of QT-prolonging drugs may nevertheless influence the extent to which those drugs affect the electrocardiogram and produce arrhythmias. Severe skin rashes during treatment with the anticonvulsant carbamazepine and the antiretroviral abacavir have been associated with variants in the HLA gene cluster (Table 5¨C2).

Multiple Variants Modulating Drug Effects

Polymorphisms in multiple candidate genes can be associated with variability in the effect of a single drug. CYP2C9 loss-of-function variants are associated with a requirement for lower maintenance doses of the vitamin K antagonist anticoagulant warfarin. In rarer (<2%) individuals homozygous for these variant alleles, maintenance warfarin dosages may be difficult to establish, and the risk of bleeding complications appears increased. In addition to CYP2C9, multiple variants in the promoter region of VKORC1, encoding a vitamin K epoxide reductase (the warfarin target), predict warfarin dosages; these promoter variants are in tight linkage disequilibrium, i.e., genotyping at one polymorphic site within this haplotype block provides reliable information on the identity of genotypes at other linked sites (Chap. 61).

Genome-Wide Association and Variable Drug Response

A GWA study was used to compare patients with simvastatin-associated myopathy to control tolerating the drugs and identified a single noncoding SNP in SLCO1B1, encoding OATP1B1, a drug transporter known to modulate simvastatin uptake into the liver. The SNP was in linkage disequilibrium with a known nonsynonymous SNP modulating OATP1B1 function and was estimated to account for 60% of myopathy risk. GWA approaches have also implicated interferon variants in antileukemic responses and in response to therapy in hepatitis C (Table 5¨C2).

Prospects for Incorporating Pharmacogenetic Information into Clinical Practice

The description of genetic variants linked to variable drug responses naturally raises the question of if and how to use this information in practice. Indeed, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has begun incorporating pharmacogenetic data into information ("package inserts") meant to guide prescribing. A decision to adopt pharmacogenetically guided dosing for a given drug depends on multiple factors. The most important are the magnitude and clinical importance of the genetic effect and the strength of evidence linking genetic variation to variable drug effects (e.g., anecdote versus post-hoc analysis of clinical trial data versus randomized prospective clinical trial). The evidence can be strengthened if statistical arguments from clinical trial data are complemented by an understanding of underlying physiologic mechanisms. Cost versus expected benefit may also be a factor.

When the evidence is compelling and alternate therapies are not available, there is a strong argument for deploying genetic testing as a guide to prescribing. Examples include associations between UGT1A1 variants and irinotecan toxicity, or between HLA-B*5701 and severe skin toxicity with abacavir. In other situations, the arguments are less compelling: the magnitude of the genetic effect may be smaller, the consequences may be less serious, alternate therapies may be available, or the drug effect may be amenable to monitoring by other approaches. Ongoing clinical trials are addressing the utility of preprescription genotyping in large populations exposed to drugs with known pharmacogenetic variants (e.g., warfarin). Importantly, technological advances are now raising the possibility of inexpensive whole genome sequencing. Incorporating a patient's whole genome sequence into their electronic medical record would allow the information to be accessed as needed for many genetic and pharmacogenetic applications. There are multiple issues (e.g., economic, technological, and ethical) that need to be addressed if such a paradigm is to be adopted (Chap. 61). While barriers to bringing genomic and pharmacogenomic information to the bedside seem daunting, the field is very young and evolving rapidly. Indeed, one major result of understanding the role of genetics in drug action has been improved screening of drugs during the development process to reduce the likelihood of highly variable metabolism or unanticipated toxicity.
 
Interactions between Drugs

Drug interactions can complicate therapy by increasing or decreasing the action of a drug; interactions may be based on changes in drug disposition or in drug response in the absence of changes in drug levels. Interactions must be considered in the differential diagnosis of any unusual response occurring during drug therapy. Prescribers should recognize that patients often come to them with a legacy of drugs acquired during previous medical experiences, often with multiple physicians who may not be aware of all the patient's medications. A meticulous drug history should include examination of the patient's medications and, if necessary, calls to the pharmacist to identify prescriptions. It should also address the use of agents not often volunteered during questioning, such as over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, health food supplements, and topical agents such as eye drops. Lists of interactions are available from a number of electronic sources. While it is unrealistic to expect the practicing physician to memorize these, certain drugs consistently run the risk of generating interactions, often by inhibiting or inducing specific drug elimination pathways. Examples are presented below and in Table 5¨C3. Accordingly, when these drugs are started or stopped, prescribers must be especially alert to the possibility of interactions.

Pharmacokinetic Interactions Causing Decreased Drug Effects

Gastrointestinal absorption can be reduced if a drug interaction results in drug binding in the gut, as with aluminum-containing antacids, kaolin-pectin suspensions, or bile acid sequestrants. Drugs such as histamine H2 receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors that alter gastric pH may decrease the solubility and hence absorption of weak bases such as ketoconazole.

Expression of some genes responsible for drug elimination, notably CYP3A and MDR1, can be markedly increased by "inducing" drugs, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John's wort, and glutethimide, and by smoking, exposure to chlorinated insecticides such as DDT (CYP1A2), and chronic alcohol ingestion. Administration of inducing agents lowers plasma levels over 2¨C3 weeks as gene expression is increased. If a drug dose is stabilized in the presence of an inducer that is subsequently stopped, major toxicity can occur as clearance returns to preinduction levels and drug concentrations rise. Individuals vary in the extent to which drug metabolism can be induced, likely through genetic mechanisms.

Interactions that inhibit the bioactivation of prodrugs will similarly decrease drug effects. The analgesic effect of codeine depends on its metabolism to morphine via CYP2D6. Thus, CYP2D6 inhibitors (Table 5¨C1) are predicted to reduce the analgesic efficacy of codeine in EMs. Similarly, omeprazole, and perhaps other proton pump inhibitors, reduce CYP2C19 activity and have been associated with reduced clopidogrel efficacy.

Interactions that decrease drug delivery to intracellular sites of action can decrease drug effects: tricyclic antidepressants can blunt the antihypertensive effect of clonidine by decreasing its uptake into adrenergic neurons. Reduced CNS penetration of multiple HIVprotease inhibitors (with the attendant risk of facilitating viral replication in a sanctuary site) appears attributable to P-glycoprotein-mediated exclusion of the drug from the CNS; indeed, inhibition of P-glycoprotein has been proposed as a therapeutic approach to enhance drug entry to the CNS (Fig. 5-5A).

Pharmacokinetic Interactions Causing Increased Drug Effects

The most common mechanism here is inhibition of drug elimination. In contrast to induction, new protein synthesis is not involved, and the effect develops as drug and any inhibitor metabolites accumulate (a function of their elimination half-lives). Since shared substrates of a single enzyme can compete for access to the active site of the protein, many CYP substrates can also be considered inhibitors. However, some drugs are especially potent as inhibitors (and occasionally may not even be substrates) of specific drug elimination pathways, and so it is in the use of these agents that clinicians must be most alert to the potential for interactions (Table 5¨C3). Commonly implicated interacting drugs of this type include amiodarone, cimetidine, erythromycin and some other macrolide antibiotics (clarithromycin but not azithromycin), ketoconazole and other azole antifungals, the antiretroviral agent ritonavir, and high concentrations of grapefruit juice (Table 5¨C3). The consequences of such interactions will depend on the drug whose elimination is being inhibited; high-risk drugs are those for which alternate pathways of elimination are not available and for which drug accumulation increases the risk of serious toxicity (see "The Concept of High-Risk Pharmacokinetics," above). Examples include CYP3A inhibitors increasing the risk of cyclosporine toxicity or of rhabdomyolysis with some HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin), and P-glycoprotein inhibitors increasing risk of digoxin toxicity.

These interactions can be exploited to therapeutic benefit. The antiviral ritonavir is a very potent CYP3A4 inhibitor that is sometimes added to anti-HIV regimens, not because of its antiviral effects but because it decreases clearance, and hence increases efficacy, of other anti-HIV agents. Similarly, calcium channel blockers have been deliberately coadministered with cyclosporine to reduce its clearance and thus its maintenance dosage and cost.

Phenytoin, an inducer of many systems, including CYP3A, inhibits CYP2C9. CYP2C9 metabolism of losartan to its active metabolite is inhibited by phenytoin, with potential loss of antihypertensive effect.

Grapefruit (but not orange) juice inhibits CYP3A, especially at high doses; patients receiving drugs where even modest CYP3A inhibition may increase the risk of adverse effects (e.g., cyclosporine, some HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) should therefore avoid grapefruit juice.

CYP2D6 is markedly inhibited by quinidine, a number of neuroleptic drugs (chlorpromazine and haloperidol), and the SSRIs fluoxetine and paroxetine. Clinical consequences of fluoxetine's interaction with CYP2D6 substrates may not be apparent for weeks after the drug is started, because of its very long half-life and slow generation of a CYP2D6-inhibiting metabolite.

6-Mercaptopurine is metabolized not only by TPMT but also by xanthine oxidase. When allopurinol, a potent inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, is administered with standard doses of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine, life-threatening toxicity (bone marrow suppression) can result.

A number of drugs are secreted by the renal tubular transport systems for organic anions. Inhibition of these systems can cause excessive drug accumulation. Salicylate, for example, reduces the renal clearance of methotrexate, an interaction that may lead to methotrexate toxicity. Renal tubular secretion contributes substantially to the elimination of penicillin, which can be inhibited (to increase its therapeutic effect) by probenecid. Similarly, inhibition of the tubular cation transport system by cimetidine decreases the renal clearance of dofetilide and of procainamide and its active metabolite NAPA.

Drug Interactions Not Mediated by Changes in Drug Disposition

Drugs may act on separate components of a common process to generate effects greater than either has alone. Antithrombotic therapy with combinations of antiplatelet agents (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, aspirin, clopidogrel) and anticoagulants (warfarin, heparins) are often used in the treatment of vascular disease, although such combinations carry an increased risk of bleeding.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause gastric ulcers, and in patients treated with warfarin, the risk of bleeding from a peptic ulcer is increased almost threefold by concomitant use of an NSAID.

Indomethacin, piroxicam, and probably other NSAIDs antagonize the antihypertensive effects of -adrenergic receptor blockers, diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and other drugs. The resulting elevation in blood pressure ranges from trivial to severe. This effect is not seen with aspirin and sulindac but has been found with the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitor celecoxib.

Torsades des pointes ventricular tachycardia during administration of QT-prolonging antiarrhythmics (quinidine, sotalol, dofetilide) occurs much more frequently in patients receiving diuretics, probably reflecting hypokalemia. In vitro, hypokalemia not only prolongs the QT interval in the absence of drug but also potentiates drug block of ion channels that results in QT prolongation. Also, some diuretics have direct electrophysiologic actions that prolong QT.

The administration of supplemental potassium leads to more frequent and more severe hyperkalemia when potassium elimination is reduced by concurrent treatment with ACE inhibitors, spironolactone, amiloride, or triamterene.

The pharmacologic effects of sildenafil result from inhibition of the phosphodiesterase type 5 isoform that inactivates cyclic GMP in the vasculature. Nitroglycerin and related nitrates used to treat angina produce vasodilation by elevating cyclic GMP. Thus, coadministration of these nitrates with sildenafil can cause profound hypotension, which can be catastrophic in patients with coronary disease.

Sometimes, combining drugs can increase overall efficacy and/or reduce drug-specific toxicity. Such therapeutically useful interactions are described in chapters dealing with specific disease entities.
 
Adverse Reactions to Drugs

The beneficial effects of drugs are coupled with the inescapable risk of untoward effects. The morbidity and mortality from these adverse effects often present diagnostic problems because they can involve every organ and system of the body and may be mistaken for signs of underlying disease. As well, some surveys have suggested that drug therapy for a range of chronic conditions such as psychiatric disease or hypertension does not achieve its desired goal in up to half of treated patients; thus, the most common "adverse" drug effect may be failure of efficacy.

Adverse reactions can be classified in two broad groups. One type results from exaggeration of an intended pharmacologic action of the drug, such as increased bleeding with anticoagulants or bone marrow suppression with antineoplastics. The second type of adverse reaction ensues from toxic effects unrelated to the intended pharmacologic actions. The latter effects are often unanticipated (especially with new drugs) and frequently severe and may result from recognized as well as previously undescribed mechanisms.

Drugs may increase the frequency of an event that is common in a general population, and this may be especially difficult to recognize; an excellent example is the increase in myocardial infarctions with the COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib. Drugs can also cause rare and serious adverse effects, such as hematologic abnormalities, arrhythmias, severe skin reactions, or hepatic or renal dysfunction. Prior to regulatory approval and marketing, new drugs are tested in relatively few patients who tend to be less sick and to have fewer concomitant diseases than those patients who subsequently receive the drug therapeutically. Because of the relatively small number of patients studied in clinical trials and the selected nature of these patients, rare adverse effects are generally not detected prior to a drug's approval; indeed, if they are detected, the new drugs are generally not approved. Therefore, physicians need to be cautious in the prescription of new drugs and alert for the appearance of previously unrecognized adverse events.

Elucidating mechanisms underlying adverse drug effects can assist development of safer compounds or allow a patient subset at especially high risk to be excluded from drug exposure. National adverse reaction reporting systems, such as those operated by the FDA (suspected adverse reactions can be reported online at http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/report/hcp.htm) and the Committee on Safety of Medicines in Great Britain, can prove useful. The publication or reporting of a newly recognized adverse reaction can in a short time stimulate many similar such reports of reactions that previously had gone unrecognized.

Occasionally, "adverse" effects may be exploited to develop an entirely new indication for a drug. Unwanted hair growth during minoxidil treatment of severely hypertensive patients led to development of the drug for hair growth. Sildenafil was initially developed as an antianginal, but its effects to alleviate erectile dysfunction not only led to a new drug indication but also to increased understanding of the role of type 5 phosphodiesterase in erectile tissue. These examples further reinforce the concept that prescribers must remain vigilant to the possibility that unusual symptoms may reflect unappreciated drug effects.

Some 25¨C50% of patients make errors in self-administration of prescribed medicines, and these errors can be responsible for adverse drug effects. Similarly, patients commit errors in taking OTC drugs by not reading or following the directions on the containers. Physicians must recognize that providing directions with prescriptions does not always guarantee compliance.

In hospitals, drugs are administered in a controlled setting, and patient compliance is, in general, ensured. Errors may occur nevertheless¡ªthe wrong drug or dose may be given or the drug may be given to the wrong patient¡ªand improved drug distribution and administration systems are addressing this problem.

Scope of the Problem

Patients receive, on average, 10 different drugs during each hospitalization. The sicker the patient, the more drugs are given, and there is a corresponding increase in the likelihood of adverse drug reactions. When <6 different drugs are given to hospitalized patients, the probability of an adverse reaction is 5%, but if >15 drugs are given, the probability is >40%. Retrospective analyses of ambulatory patients have revealed adverse drug effects in 20%. Serious adverse reactions are also well-recognized with "herbal" remedies and OTC compounds: examples include kava-associated hepatotoxicity, L-tryptophan-associated eosinophilia-myalgia, and phenylpropanolamine-associated stroke, each of which has caused fatalities.

A small group of widely used drugs accounts for a disproportionate number of reactions. Aspirin and other NSAIDs, analgesics, digoxin, anticoagulants, diuretics, antimicrobials, glucocorticoids, antineoplastics, and hypoglycemic agents account for 90% of reactions, although the drugs involved differ between ambulatory and hospitalized patients.

Toxicity Unrelated to a Drug's Primary Pharmacologic Activity

Cytotoxic Reactions

Drugs or more commonly reactive metabolites generated by CYPs can covalently bind to tissue macromolecules (such as proteins or DNA) to cause tissue toxicity. Because of the reactive nature of these metabolites, covalent binding often occurs close to the site of production, typically the liver.

The most common cause of drug-induced hepatotoxicity is acetaminophen overdosage. Normally, reactive metabolites are detoxified by combining with hepatic glutathione. When glutathione becomes depleted, the metabolites bind instead to hepatic protein, with resultant hepatocyte damage. The hepatic necrosis produced by the ingestion of acetaminophen can be prevented or attenuated by the administration of substances such as N-acetylcysteine that reduce the binding of electrophilic metabolites to hepatic proteins. The risk of acetaminophen-related hepatic necrosis is increased in patients receiving drugs such as phenobarbital or phenytoin that increase the rate of drug metabolism or ethanol that exhaust glutathione stores. Such toxicity has even occurred with therapeutic dosages, so patients at risk through these mechanisms should be warned.

Immunologic Mechanisms

Most pharmacologic agents are small molecules with low molecular weights (<2,000) and thus are poor immunogens. Generation of an immune response to a drug therefore usually requires in vivo activation and covalent linkage to protein, carbohydrate, or nucleic acid.

Drug stimulation of antibody production may mediate tissue injury by several mechanisms. The antibody may attack the drug when the drug is covalently attached to a cell and thereby destroy the cell. This occurs in penicillin-induced hemolytic anemia. Antibody-drug-antigen complexes may be passively adsorbed by a bystander cell, which is then destroyed by activation of complement; this occurs in quinine- and quinidine-induced thrombocytopenia. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia arises when antibodies against complexes of platelet factor 4 peptide and heparin generate immune complexes that activate platelets; thus, the thrombocytopenia is accompanied by "paradoxical" thrombosis and is treated with thrombin inhibitors. Drugs or their reactive metabolites may alter a host tissue, rendering it antigenic and eliciting autoantibodies. For example, hydralazine and procainamide (or their reactive metabolites) can chemically alter nuclear material, stimulating the formation of antinuclear antibodies and occasionally causing lupus erythematosus. Drug-induced pure red cell aplasia (Chap. 107) is due to an immune-based drug reaction.

Serum sickness (Chap. 317) results from the deposition of circulating drug-antibody complexes on endothelial surfaces. Complement activation occurs, chemotactic factors are generated locally, and an inflammatory response develops at the site of complex entrapment. Arthralgias, urticaria, lymphadenopathy, glomerulonephritis, or cerebritis may result. Foreign proteins (vaccines, streptokinase, therapeutic antibodies) and antibiotics are common causes. Many drugs, particularly antimicrobial agents, ACE inhibitors, and aspirin, can elicit anaphylaxis with production of IgE, which binds to mast cell membranes. Contact with a drug antigen initiates a series of biochemical events in the mast cell and results in the release of mediators that can produce the characteristic urticaria, wheezing, flushing, rhinorrhea, and (occasionally) hypotension.

Drugs may also elicit cell-mediated immune responses. Topically administered substances may interact with sulfhydryl or amino groups in the skin and react with sensitized lymphocytes to produce the rash characteristic of contact dermatitis. Other types of rashes may also result from the interaction of serum factors, drugs, and sensitized lymphocytes.

Diagnosis and Treatment of Adverse Drug Reactions

The manifestations of drug-induced diseases frequently resemble those of other diseases, and a given set of manifestations may be produced by different and dissimilar drugs. Recognition of the role of a drug or drugs in an illness depends on appreciation of the possible adverse reactions to drugs in any disease, on identification of the temporal relationship between drug administration and development of the illness, and on familiarity with the common manifestations of the drugs. A suspected adverse drug reaction developing after introduction of a new drug naturally implicates that drug; however, it is also important to remember that a drug interaction may be responsible. Thus, for example, a patient on a chronic stable warfarin dose may develop a bleeding complication after introduction of amiodarone; this does not reflect a direct reaction to amiodarone but rather its effect to inhibit warfarin metabolism. Many associations between particular drugs and specific reactions have been described, but there is always a "first time" for a novel association, and any drug should be suspected of causing an adverse effect if the clinical setting is appropriate.

Illness related to a drug's intended pharmacologic action is often more easily recognized than illness attributable to immune or other mechanisms. For example, side effects such as cardiac arrhythmias in patients receiving digitalis, hypoglycemia in patients given insulin, or bleeding in patients receiving anticoagulants are more readily related to a specific drug than are symptoms such as fever or rash, which may be caused by many drugs or by other factors.

Electronic listings of adverse drug reactions can be useful. However, exhaustive compilations often provide little sense of perspective in terms of frequency and seriousness, which can vary considerably among patients.

Eliciting a drug history from each patient is important for diagnosis. Attention must be directed to OTC drugs and herbal preparations as well as to prescription drugs. Each type can be responsible for adverse drug effects, and adverse interactions may occur between OTC drugs and prescribed drugs. Loss of efficacy of oral contraceptives or cyclosporine by concurrent use of St. John's wort are examples. In addition, it is common for patients to be cared for by several physicians, and duplicative, additive, antagonistic, or synergistic drug combinations may therefore be administered if the physicians are not aware of the patients' drug histories. Every physician should determine what drugs a patient has been taking, for the previous month or two ideally, before prescribing any medications. Medications stopped for inefficacy or adverse effects should be documented to avoid pointless and potentially dangerous reexposure. A frequently overlooked source of additional drug exposure is topical therapy; for example, a patient complaining of bronchospasm may not mention that an ophthalmic beta blocker is being used unless specifically asked. A history of previous adverse drug effects in patients is common. Since these patients have shown a predisposition to drug-induced illnesses, such a history should dictate added caution in prescribing new drugs.

Laboratory studies may include demonstration of serum antibody in some persons with drug allergies involving cellular blood elements, as in agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. For example, both quinine and quinidine can produce platelet agglutination in vitro in the presence of complement and the serum from a patient who has developed thrombocytopenia following use of this drug. Biochemical abnormalities such as G6PD deficiency, serum pseudocholinesterase level, or genotyping may also be useful in diagnosis, often after an adverse effect has occurred in the patient or a family member.

Once an adverse reaction is suspected, discontinuation of the suspected drug followed by disappearance of the reaction is presumptive evidence of a drug-induced illness. Confirming evidence may be sought by cautiously reintroducing the drug and seeing if the reaction reappears. However, that should be done only if confirmation would be useful in the future management of the patient and if the attempt would not entail undue risk. With concentration-dependent adverse reactions, lowering the dosage may cause the reaction to disappear, and raising it may cause the reaction to reappear. When the reaction is thought to be allergic, however, readministration of the drug may be hazardous, since anaphylaxis may develop.

If the patient is receiving many drugs when an adverse reaction is suspected, the drugs likeliest to be responsible can usually be identified; this should include both potential culprit agents as well as drugs that alter their elimination. All drugs may be discontinued at once or, if this is not practical, discontinued one at a time, starting with the ones most suspect, and the patient observed for signs of improvement. The time needed for a concentration-dependent adverse effect to disappear depends on the time required for the concentration to fall below the range associated with the adverse effect; that, in turn, depends on the initial blood level and on the rate of elimination or metabolism of the drug. Adverse effects of drugs with long half-lives or those not directly related to serum concentration may take a considerable time to disappear.
 
Summary

Modern clinical pharmacology aims to replace empiricism in the use of drugs with therapy based on in-depth understanding of factors that determine an individual's response to drug treatment. Molecular pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, genetics, clinical trials, and the educated prescriber all contribute to this process. No drug response should ever be termed idiosyncratic; all responses have a mechanism whose understanding will help guide further therapy with that drug or successors. This rapidly expanding understanding of variability in drug actions makes the process of prescribing drugs increasingly daunting for the practitioner. However, fundamental principles should guide this process:

The benefits of drug therapy, however defined, should always outweigh the risk.
The smallest dosage necessary to produce the desired effect should be used.
The number of medications and doses per day should be minimized.
Although the literature is rapidly expanding, accessing it is becoming easier; electronic tools to search databases of literature and unbiased opinion will become increasingly commonplace.
Genetics play a role in determining variability in drug response and may become a part of clinical practice.
Electronic medical record and pharmacy systems will increasingly incorporate prescribing advice, such as indicated medications not used; unindicated medications being prescribed; and potential dosing errors, drug interactions, or genetically determined drug responses.
Prescribers should be particularly wary when adding or stopping specific drugs that are especially liable to provoke interactions and adverse reactions.
Prescribers should use only a limited number of drugs, with which they are thoroughly familiar.

Womens Health: Introduction

The study of biologic differences between sexes has emerged as a distinct scientific discipline. A report from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) found that sex has a broad impact on biologic and disease processes and succinctly concluded that sex matters. The National Institutes of Health established the Office of Research on Womens Health in 1990 to develop an agenda for future research in the field. In parallel, womens health has become a distinct clinical discipline with a focus on disorders that occur disproportionately in women. The integration of womens health into internal medicine and other specialties has been accompanied by novel approaches to health care delivery, including greater attention to patient education and involvement in disease prevention and medical decision-making.

The IOM report recommended the term sex difference to describe biologic processes that differ between males and females and gender difference for features related to social influences. Disorders highlighted here are reviewed in detail in other chapters.
 
Disease Risk: Reality and Perception

The leading causes of death are the same in women and men: (1) heart disease, (2) cancer (Table 6-1; Fig. 6-1). The leading cause of cancer death, lung cancer, is the same in both sexes. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women, but it causes about 60% fewer deaths than does lung cancer. Men are substantially more likely to die from suicide, homicide, and accidents than are women.

Note that the scale of the y axis is increased in the graph on the right compared with that on the left. Accidents and HIV/AIDS are the leading causes of death in young women 20¨C34 years of age. Accidents, breast cancer, and ischemic heart disease (IHD) are the leading causes of death in women 35¨C49 years of age. IHD becomes the leading cause of death in women beginning at age 50 years. In older women, IHD remains the leading cause of death, cerebrovascular disease becomes the second leading cause of death, and lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. At age 85 years and beyond, AD becomes the third leading cause of death. AD, Alzheimers disease; Ca, cancer; CLRD, chronic lower respiratory disease; DM, diabetes mellitus.

Womens risk for many diseases increases at menopause, which occurs at a median age of 51.4 years. In the industrialized world, women spend one-third of their lives in the postmenopausal period. Estrogen levels fall abruptly at menopause, inducing a variety of physiologic and metabolic responses. Rates of cardiovascular disease increase and bone density begins to decrease rapidly after menopause. In the United States, women live on average about 5 years longer than men, with a life expectancy at birth in 2007 of 80.4 years compared with 75.3 years in men. Elderly women outnumber elderly men, so that age-related conditions such as hypertension have a female preponderance. However, the difference in life expectancy between men and women has decreased an average of 0.1 year every year since 1980, and if this convergence in mortality figures continues, it is projected that mortality rates will be similar by 2054.

Womens perception of disease risk is often inaccurate (Fig. 6-2). Public awareness campaigns have resulted in almost 60% of U.S. women knowing that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in women. Nevertheless, the condition they fear most is breast cancer despite the fact that death rates from breast cancer have been falling since the 1990s. In any specific decade of life, a womans risk for breast cancer never exceeds 1 in 34. Although a womans lifetime risk of developing breast cancer if she lives past 85 years is about 1 in 9, it is much more likely that she will die from cardiovascular disease than from breast cancer. In other words, many elderly women have breast cancer but die from other causes. Similarly, a minority of women are aware that lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women. Physicians are also less likely to recognize womens risk for cardiovascular disease. These misconceptions are unfortunate as they perpetuate inadequate attention to modifiable risk factors such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and cigarette smoking.

Data for obesity were not available for 1997 and 2000. Significantly more women cited heart disease/heart attack as the greatest health problem for women in 2006 compared with previous survey years. Breast cancer remained the most commonly identified greatest health risk in all survey years. (From Christian et al; with permission.)
 
 
 
Sex Differences in Health and Disease

Alzheimers Disease

(See also Chap. 371) Alzheimers disease (AD) affects approximately twice as many women as men. Because the risk for AD increases with age, part of this sex difference is accounted for by the fact that women live longer than men. However, additional factors probably contribute to the increased risk for AD in women, including sex differences in brain size, structure, and functional organization. There is emerging evidence for sex-specific differences in gene expression, not only for genes on the X and Y chromosomes but also for some autosomal genes. Estrogens have pleiotropic genomic and nongenomic effects on the central nervous system, including neurotrophic actions in key areas involved in cognition and memory. Women with AD have lower endogenous estrogen levels than do women without AD. These observations have led to the hypothesis that estrogen is neuroprotective.

Some studies have suggested that estrogen administration improves cognitive function in nondemented postmenopausal women as well as in women with AD, and several observational studies have suggested that postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) may decrease the risk of AD. However, HT placebo-controlled trials have found no improvement in disease progression or cognitive function in women with AD. Further, the Womens Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), an ancillary study in the Womens Health Initiative (WHI), found no benefit compared with placebo of estrogen alone [combined continuous equine estrogen (CEE), 0.625 mg qd] or estrogen with progestin [CEE, 0.625 mg qd, and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), 2.5 mg qd] on cognitive function or the development of dementia in women 65 years. Indeed, there was a significantly increased risk for both dementia and mild cognitive impairment in women receiving hormone therapy. The possible explanations for the discrepant results between the observational studies and the randomized clinical trials remain unclear (Chap. 348).

Cardiovascular Disease

(See also Chap. 243) There are major sex differences in cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in men and women in developed countries. Since 1984, more women than men have died of cardiovascular disease. Gonadal steroids have major effects on the cardiovascular system and lipid metabolism. Estrogen increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and lowers low-density lipoprotein (LDL), whereas androgens have the opposite effect. Estrogen has direct vasodilatory effects on the vascular endothelium, enhances insulin sensitivity, and has antioxidant as well as anti-inflammatory properties. There is a striking increase in coronary heart disease (CHD) after both natural and surgical menopause, suggesting that endogenous estrogens are cardioprotective. Women also have longer QT intervals on electrocardiograms, and this increases their susceptibility to certain arrhythmias. Animal studies suggest that the sex difference in the duration of the QT interval is caused by the effects of sex steroids on cardiac repolarization, in part related to their effects on cardiac voltage-gated potassium channels; there is a lower density of the rapid component (IKr) of the delayed rectifier potassium current (IK) in females.

CHD presents differently in women, who are usually 10¨C15 years older than their male counterparts and are more likely to have comorbidities such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus (DM). In the Framingham study, angina was the most common initial symptom of CHD in women, whereas myocardial infarction was the most common initial presentation in men. Women more often have atypical symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, indigestion, and upper back pain.

Women with myocardial infarction are more likely to present with cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock, whereas men are more likely to present with ventricular tachycardia. Further, younger women with myocardial infarction are more likely to die than are men of similar age. However, this mortality gap has decreased substantially in recent years because younger women have experienced greater improvements in survival after myocardial infarction than men (Fig. 6-3). The improvement in survival is due largely to a reduction in comorbidities, suggesting a greater attention to modifiable risk factors in women.

Figure 6-3 Hospital Mortality Rates in Men and Women for Acute Myocardial Infarction in 1994¨C95 Compared with 2004¨C06.

 
 
 
Women younger than age 65 years had substantially greater mortality than men of similar age in 1994¨C95. Mortality rates declined markedly for both sexes across all age groups in 2004¨C06 compared with 1994¨C95. However, there was a more striking decrease in mortality in women younger than age 75 years compared with men of similar age. The mortality rate reduction was largest in women less than age 55 years (52.9%) and lowest in men of similar age (33.3%). (Data adapted from Vaccarino et al.)
 
 

Nevertheless, physicians are less likely to suspect heart disease in women with chest pain and less likely to perform diagnostic and therapeutic cardiac procedures in women. In addition, there are sex differences in the accuracy of certain diagnostic procedures. The exercise electrocardiogram has substantial false-positive as well as false-negative rates in women compared with men. Women are less likely to receive therapies such as angioplasty, thrombolytic therapy, coronary artery bypass grafts (CABGs), beta blockers, and aspirin. There are also sex differences in outcomes when women with CHD do receive therapeutic interventions. Women undergoing CABG surgery have more advanced disease, a higher perioperative mortality rate, less relief of angina, and less graft patency; however, 5- and 10-year survival rates are similar. Women undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty have lower rates of initial angiographic and clinical success than men, but they also have a lower rate of restenosis and a better long-term outcome. Women may benefit less and have more frequent serious bleeding complications from thrombolytic therapy compared with men. Factors such as older age, more comorbid conditions, and more severe CHD in women at the time of events or procedures appear to account in part for the observed sex differences.

Elevated cholesterol levels, hypertension, smoking, obesity, low HDL cholesterol levels, DM, and lack of physical activity are important risk factors for CHD in both men and women. Total triglyceride levels are an independent risk factor for CHD in women but not in men. Low HDL cholesterol and DM are more important risk factors for CHD in women than in men. Smoking is an important risk factor for CHD in women¡ªit accelerates atherosclerosis, exerts direct negative effects on cardiac function, and is associated with an earlier age of menopause. Cholesterol-lowering drugs are equally effective in men and women for primary and secondary prevention of CHD. However, because of perceptions that women are at lower risk for CHD, they receive fewer interventions for modifiable risk factors than do men.

In contrast to men, randomized trials showed that aspirin was not effective in the primary prevention of CHD in women; it did significantly reduce the risk of ischemic stroke. Secondary prevention in women with known CHD is also suboptimal. At baseline, only about 30% of women enrolled in the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS), a secondary prevention trial in women with established CHD, were taking beta blockers, and only 45% received lipid-lowering medications.

The sex differences in CHD prevalence, beneficial biologic effects of estradiol on the cardiovascular system, and reduced risk for CHD in observational studies of women receiving HT led to the widespread use of HT for the prevention of CHD. However, the WHI, which studied more than 16,000 women on CEE plus MPA or placebo and more than 10,000 women with hysterectomy on CEE alone or placebo, did not demonstrate a benefit of HT for the primary or secondary prevention of CHD. In addition, CEE plus MPA was associated with an increased risk for CHD, particularly in the first year of therapy, whereas CEE alone neither increased nor decreased CHD risk. Both CEE plus MPA and CEE alone were associated with an increased risk for ischemic stroke. There was no evidence for cardioprotective effects of estrogens in smaller randomized trials that used either oral or transdermal estradiol, arguing against the hypothesis that the type of estrogen or its route of administration accounted for the lack of CHD risk reduction.

In the WHI, there was a suggestion of a reduction in CHD risk in women who initiated HT closer to menopause. This finding suggests that the time at which HT is initiated is critical for cardioprotection and is consistent with the "timing hypothesis." According to this hypothesis, HT has differential effects, depending on the stage of atherosclerosis; adverse effects are seen with advanced, unstable lesions. This hypothesis is under investigation in randomized clinical trials, for example, the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS). It is noteworthy that there is no reduction in the risk for ischemic stroke when HT is initiated closer to menopause. HT is discussed further in Chap. 348.

Diabetes Mellitus

(See also Chap. 344) Women are more sensitive to insulin than men are. Despite this, the prevalence of type 2 DM is similar in men and women. There is a sex difference in the relationship between endogenous androgen levels and DM risk: Higher bioavailable testosterone levels are associated with increased risk in women, whereas lower bioavailable testosterone levels are associated with increased risk in men. Polycystic ovary syndrome and gestational DM¡ªcommon conditions in premenopausal women¡ªare associated with a significantly increased risk for type 2 DM. Premenopausal women with DM lose the cardioprotective effect of female sex and have rates of CHD identical to those in males. These women have impaired endothelial function and reduced coronary vasodilatory responses, which may predispose to cardiovascular complications. Among individuals with DM, women have a greater risk for myocardial infarction than do men. Women with DM are more likely to have left ventricular hypertrophy. In the WHI, CEE plus MPA significantly reduced the incidence of DM, whereas with CEE alone there was only a trend toward decreased DM incidence.

Hypertension

(See also Chap. 247) After age 60, hypertension is more common in U.S. women than in men, largely because of the high prevalence of hypertension in older age groups and the longer survival of women. Isolated systolic hypertension is present in 30% of women >60 years. Sex hormones affect blood pressure. Both normotensive and hypertensive women have higher blood pressure levels during the follicular phase than during the luteal phase. In the Nurses Health Study, the relative risk of hypertension was 1.8 in current users of oral contraceptives, but this risk is lower with the newer low-dose contraceptive preparations. HT is not associated with hypertension. Among secondary causes of hypertension, there is a female preponderance of renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia.

The benefits of treatment for hypertension have been dramatic in both women and men. A meta-analysis of the effects of hypertension treatment, the Individual Data Analysis of Antihypertensive Intervention Trial, found a reduction of risk for stroke and for major cardiovascular events in women. The effectiveness of various antihypertensive drugs appears to be comparable in women and men; however, women may experience more side effects. For example, women are more likely to develop cough with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

Autoimmune Disorders

(See also Chap. 318) Most autoimmune disorders occur more commonly in women than in men; they include autoimmune thyroid and liver diseases, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), scleroderma, multiple sclerosis (MS), and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. However, there is no sex difference in the incidence of type 1 DM, and ankylosing spondylitis occurs more commonly in men. There are relatively few differences in bacterial disease infection rates between men and women. In general, sex differences in viral diseases can be accounted for by differences in behaviors, such as exposures or rates of immunization. Sex differences in both immune responses and adverse reactions to vaccines have been reported. For example, there is a female preponderance of postvaccination arthritis.

The mechanisms for these sex differences remain obscure. Adaptive immune responses are more robust in women than in men; this may be explained by the stimulatory actions of estrogens and the inhibitory actions of androgens on the cellular mediators of immunity. Consistent with an important role for gonadal hormones, there is variation in immune responses during the menstrual cycle, and the activity of certain autoimmune disorders is altered by castration or pregnancy (e.g., RA and MS may remit during pregnancy). Nevertheless, the majority of studies show that exogenous estrogens and progestins in the form of HT or oral contraceptives do not alter autoimmune disease incidence or activity. Exposure to fetal antigens, including circulating fetal cells that persist in certain tissues, has been speculated to increase the risk of autoimmune responses. There is clearly an important genetic component to autoimmunity, as indicated by the familial clustering and HLA association of many such disorders. However, HLA types are not sexually dimorphic.

HIV Infection

(See also Chap. 189) Women account for almost 50% of the 40 million persons infected with HIV-1 worldwide. AIDS is an important cause of death in younger women (Fig. 6-1). Heterosexual contact with an at-risk partner is the fastest-growing transmission category, and women are more susceptible to HIV infection than are men. This increased susceptibility is accounted for in part by an increased prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases in women. Some studies have suggested that hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk of HIV transmission. Progesterone has been shown to increase susceptibility to infection in nonhuman primate models of HIV. Women are also more likely to be infected by multiple variants of the virus than are men. Women with HIV have more rapid decreases in their CD4 cell counts than do men. Compared with men, HIV-infected women more frequently develop candidiasis, but Kaposis sarcoma is less common than it is in men. Women have more adverse reactions, such as lipodystrophy, dyslipidemia, and rash, with antiretroviral therapy than do men. This observation is explained in part by sex differences in the pharmacokinetics of certain antiretroviral drugs, resulting in higher plasma concentrations in women.

Obesity

(See also Chap. 78) The prevalence of obesity is higher in women than in men. Further, >80% of patients who undergo bariatric surgery are women. Pregnancy and menopause are risk factors for obesity. There are major sex differences in body fat distribution. Women characteristically have gluteal and femoral or gynoid pattern of fat distribution, whereas men typically have a central or android pattern. Women have more subcutaneous fat than men. Gonadal steroids appear to be the major regulators of fat distribution through a number of direct effects on adipose tissue. Studies in humans also suggest that gonadal steroids play a role in modulating food intake and energy expenditure.

In men and women, upper-body obesity characterized by increased visceral fat is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and DM. In women, endogenous androgen levels are positively associated with upper-body obesity, and androgen administration increases visceral fat. In contrast, there is an inverse relationship between endogenous androgen levels and central obesity in men. Further, androgen administration decreases visceral fat in centrally obese men. The reasons for these sex differences in the relationship between visceral fat and androgens are unknown. Obesity increases a womans risk for certain cancers, in particular postmenopausal breast and endometrial cancer, in part because adipose tissue provides an extragonadal source of estrogen through aromatization of circulating adrenal and ovarian androgens, especially the conversion of androstenedione to estrone. Obesity increases the risk of infertility, miscarriage, and complications of pregnancy.

Osteoporosis

(See also Chap. 354) Osteoporosis is about five times more common in postmenopausal women than in age-matched men, and osteoporotic hip fractures are a major cause of morbidity in elderly women. Men accumulate more bone mass and lose bone more slowly than do women. Sex differences in bone mass are found as early as infancy. Calcium intake, vitamin D, and estrogen all play important roles in bone formation and bone loss. Particularly during adolescence, calcium intake is an important determinant of peak bone mass. Vitamin D deficiency is surprisingly common in elderly women, occurring in >40% of women living in northern latitudes. Receptors for estrogens and androgens have been identified in bone. Estrogen deficiency is associated with increased osteoclast activity and a decreased number of bone-forming units, leading to net bone loss. The aromatase enzyme, which converts androgens to estrogens, is also present in bone. Estrogen is an important determinant of bone mass in men (derived from the aromatization of androgens) as well as in women.

Pharmacology

On average, women have lower body weights, smaller organs, a higher percentage of body fat, and lower total-body water than men. There are also important sex differences in drug action and metabolism that are not accounted for by these differences in body size and composition. Gonadal steroids alter the binding and metabolism of a number of drugs. Further, menstrual cycle phase and pregnancy can alter drug action. Two-thirds of cases of drug-induced torsades des pointes, a rare, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia, occur in women because they have a longer, more vulnerable QT interval. These drugs, which include certain antihistamines, antibiotics, antiarrhythmics, and antipsychotics, can prolong cardiac repolarization by blocking cardiac voltage-gated potassium channels, particularly IKr. Women require lower doses of neuroleptics to control schizophrenia. Women awaken from anesthesia faster than do men given the same doses of anesthetics. Women also take more medications than men, including over-the-counter formulations and supplements. The greater use of medications combined with these biologic differences may account for the reported higher frequency of adverse drug reactions in women than in men.

Psychological Disorders

(See also Chap. 391) Depression, anxiety, and affective and eating disorders (bulimia and anorexia nervosa) are more common in women than in men. Epidemiologic studies from both developed and developing nations consistently find major depression to be twice as common in women as in men, with the sex difference becoming evident in early adolescence. Depression occurs in 10% of women during pregnancy and in 10¨C15% of women during the postpartum period. There is a high likelihood of recurrence of postpartum depression with subsequent pregnancies. The incidence of major depression diminishes after age 45 years and does not increase with the onset of menopause. Depression in women appears to have a worse prognosis than does depression in men; episodes last longer, and there is a lower rate of spontaneous remission. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders occur at equal rates in men and women, although there may be sex differences in symptoms.

Both biologic and social factors account for the greater prevalence of depressive disorders in women. Men have higher levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Gonadal steroids also affect mood, and fluctuations during the menstrual cycle have been linked to symptoms of premenstrual syndrome. Sex hormones differentially affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal responses to stress. Testosterone appears to blunt cortisol responses to corticotropin-releasing hormone. Both low and high levels of estrogen can activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

Sleep Disorders

(See also Chap. 27) There are striking sex differences in sleep and its disorders. During sleep, women have an increased amount of slow-wave activity, differences in timing of delta activity, and an increase in the number of sleep spindles. Testosterone modulates neural control of breathing and upper airway mechanics. Men have a higher prevalence of sleep apnea. Testosterone administration to hypogonadal men as well as to women increases apneic episodes during sleep. Women with the hyperandrogenic disorder polycystic ovary syndrome have an increased prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea, and apneic episodes are positively correlated with their circulating testosterone levels. In contrast, progesterone accelerates breathing, and in the past, progestins were used for treatment of sleep apnea.

Substance Abuse and Tobacco

(See also Chaps. 392 and 395) Substance abuse is more common in men than in women. However, one-third of Americans who suffer from alcoholism are women. Women alcoholics are less likely to be diagnosed than men. A greater proportion of men than women seek help for alcohol and drug abuse. Men are more likely to go to an alcohol or drug treatment facility, whereas women tend to approach a primary care physician or mental health professional for help under the guise of a psychosocial problem. Late-life alcoholism is more common in women than in men. On average, alcoholic women drink less than alcoholic men but exhibit the same degree of impairment. Blood alcohol levels are higher in women than in men after drinking equivalent amounts of alcohol, adjusted for body weight. This greater bioavailability of alcohol in women is due to both the smaller volume of distribution and the slower gastric metabolism of alcohol secondary to lower activity of gastric alcohol dehydrogenase than is the case in men. In addition, alcoholic women are more likely to abuse tranquilizers, sedatives, and amphetamines. Women alcoholics have a higher mortality rate than do nonalcoholic women and alcoholic men. Women also appear to develop alcoholic liver disease and other alcohol-related diseases with shorter drinking histories and lower levels of alcohol consumption. Alcohol abuse also poses special risks to a woman, adversely affecting fertility and the health of the baby (fetal alcohol syndrome). Even moderate alcohol use increases the risk of breast cancer, hypertension, and stroke in women.

More men than women smoke tobacco, but the prevalence of smoking is declining faster in men than in women. Smoking markedly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease in premenopausal women and is also associated with a decrease in the age of menopause. Women who smoke are more likely to develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer than men and at lower levels of tobacco exposure.

Violence Against Women

Domestic violence is the most common cause of physical injury in women, exceeding the combined incidence of all other types of injury (such as from rape, mugging, and auto accidents). Sexual assault is one of the most common crimes against women. One in five adult women in the United States reports having experienced sexual assault during her lifetime. Adult women are much more likely to be raped by a spouse, ex-spouse, or acquaintance than by a stranger. Domestic violence may be an unrecognized feature of certain clinical presentations, such as chronic abdominal pain, headaches, substance abuse, and eating disorders, in addition to more obvious manifestations such as trauma.
 
Summary

Womens health is now a mature discipline, and the importance of sex differences in biologic processes is well recognized. There has been a striking reduction in the excess mortality rate from myocardial infarction in younger women. Nevertheless, ongoing misperceptions about disease risk not only among women but also among their physicians result in inadequate attention to modifiable risk factors. Research into the fundamental mechanisms of sex differences will provide important biologic insights. Further, those insights will have an impact on both womens and mens health.

Medical Disorders during Pregnancy: Introduction

Each year, approximately 4 million births occur in the United States, and more than 130 million births occur worldwide. A significant proportion of these are complicated by medical disorders. In the past, many medical disorders were contraindications to pregnancy. Advances in obstetrics, neonatology, obstetric anesthesiology, and medicine have increased the expectation that pregnancy will result in a positive outcome for both mother and fetus despite most of these conditions. Successful pregnancy requires important physiologic adaptations, such as a marked increase in cardiac output. Medical problems that interfere with the physiologic adaptations of pregnancy increase the risk for poor pregnancy outcome; conversely, in some instances, pregnancy may adversely impact an underlying medical disorder.
 
Hypertension

(See also Chap. 247)

In pregnancy, cardiac output increases by 40%, most of which is due to an increase in stroke volume. Heart rate increases by ~10 beats/min during the third trimester. In the second trimester, systemic vascular resistance decreases and this is associated with a fall in blood pressure. During pregnancy, a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg is considered to be abnormally elevated and is associated with an increase in perinatal morbidity and mortality. In all pregnant women, the measurement of blood pressure should be performed in the sitting position, because the lateral recumbent position may result in a blood pressure lower than that recorded in the sitting position. The diagnosis of hypertension requires the measurement of two elevated blood pressures, at least 6 h apart. Hypertension during pregnancy is usually caused by preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, or renal disease.

Preeclampsia

Approximately 5¨C7% of all pregnant women develop preeclampsia, the new onset of hypertension (blood pressure >140/90 mmHg) and proteinuria (>300 mg/24 h) after 20 weeks of gestation. Although the precise pathophysiology of preeclampsia remains unknown, recent studies show excessive placental production of antagonists to both vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF) (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 and sflt-1) and transforming growth factor  (TGF-) (endoglin). These antagonists to VEGF and TGF- disrupt endothelial and renal glomerular function resulting in edema, hypertension, and proteinuria. The renal histological feature of preeclampsia is glomerular endotheliosis. Glomerular endothelial cells are swollen and encroach on the vascular lumen. Preeclampsia is associated with abnormalities of cerebral circulatory autoregulation, which increase the risk of stroke at near-normal blood pressures. Risk factors for the development of preeclampsia include nulliparity, diabetes mellitus, a history of renal disease or chronic hypertension, a prior history of preeclampsia, extremes of maternal age (>35 years or <15 years), obesity, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and multiple gestation.

Severe preeclampsia is the presence of new-onset hypertension and proteinuria accompanied by end organ damage. Features may include marked elevation of blood pressure (>160/110 mmHg), severe proteinuria (>5 g/24 h), or evidence of central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction (headaches, blurred vision, seizures, coma), renal dysfunction (oliguria or creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL), pulmonary edema, hepatocellular injury (ALT > 2-fold the upper limits of normal), hematologic dysfunction (platelet count < 100,000/L or disseminated intravascular coagulation), or placental dysfunction (oligohydramnios or severe intrauterine growth restriction). The HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome is a special subgroup of severe preeclampsia and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in this disease. The presence of platelet dysfunction and coagulation disorders further increases the risk of stroke.

Treatment: Preeclampsia

Preeclampsia resolves within a few weeks after delivery. For pregnant women with preeclampsia prior to 37 weeks gestation, delivery reduces the mothers morbidity but exposes the fetus to the risk of premature birth. The management of preeclampsia is challenging because it requires the clinician to balance the health of the mother and fetus simultaneously. In general, prior to term, women with mild preeclampsia may be managed conservatively with bed rest, close monitoring of blood pressure and renal function, and careful fetal surveillance. For women with severe preeclampsia, delivery is recommended unless the patient is eligible for expectant management in a tertiary hospital setting. Expectant management of severe preeclampsia remote from term affords some benefits for the fetus but significant risks for the mother.

The definitive treatment of preeclampsia is delivery of the fetus and placenta. For women with severe preeclampsia, aggressive management of blood pressures > 160/110 mmHg reduces the risk of cerebrovascular accidents. Intravenous labetalol or hydralazine are the drugs most commonly used to manage preeclampsia, but labetalol is associated with fewer episodes of maternal hypotension. Nifedipine is also commonly used in pregnancy. Elevated arterial pressure should be reduced slowly to avoid hypotension and a decrease in blood flow to the fetus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as well as angiotensin-receptor blockers should be avoided in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy because of their adverse effects on fetal development.

Magnesium sulfate is the treatment of choice for the prevention and treatment of eclamptic seizures. Large, randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the superiority of magnesium sulfate over phenytoin and diazepam, and the efficacy of magnesium sulfate in reducing the risk of seizure and, possibly, the risk of maternal death. Magnesium may prevent seizures by interacting with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the CNS. Given the difficulty of predicting eclamptic seizures on the basis of disease severity, once the decision to proceed with delivery is made, most patients carrying a diagnosis of preeclampsia should be treated with magnesium sulfate. Women who have had preeclampsia appear to be at increased risk of cardiovascular and renal disease later in life.

Chronic Essential Hypertension

Pregnancy complicated by chronic essential hypertension is associated with intrauterine growth restriction and increased perinatal mortality. Pregnant women with chronic hypertension are at increased risk for superimposed preeclampsia and abruptio placenta. Women with chronic hypertension should have a thorough prepregnancy evaluation, both to identify remediable causes of hypertension and to ensure that the prescribed antihypertensive agents are not associated with an adverse outcome of pregnancy (e.g., ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers). -Methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine are the most commonly used medications for the treatment of chronic hypertension in pregnancy. -Methyldopa is a relatively poor antihypertensive drug, but it has a long record of safe use in pregnancy. With the development of newer antihypertensives, also with long records of safe use in pregnancy, and with improved methods of fetal surveillance, we no longer recommend -methyldopa as first-line therapy for the management of chronic hypertension. Baseline evaluation of renal function is necessary to help differentiate the effects of chronic hypertension versus superimposed preeclampsia, should the hypertension worsen during pregnancy. There are no convincing data that demonstrate that treatment of mild chronic hypertension improves perinatal outcome.

Gestational Hypertension

This is the development of elevated blood pressure during pregnancy or in the first 24 h post-partum in the absence of preexisting chronic hypertension or proteinuria. Mild gestational hypertension that does not progress to preeclampsia has not been associated with adverse pregnancy outcome or adverse long-term prognosis.
 
Renal Disease

(See also Chaps. 278 and 286)

Normal pregnancy is characterized by an increase in glomerular filtration rate and creatinine clearance. This occurs secondary to a rise in renal plasma flow and increased glomerular filtration pressures. Patients with underlying renal disease and hypertension may expect a worsening of hypertension during pregnancy. If superimposed preeclampsia develops, the additional endothelial injury results in a capillary leak syndrome that may make the management challenging. In general, patients with underlying renal disease and hypertension benefit from aggressive management of blood pressure. Preconception counseling is also essential for these patients so that accurate risk assessment and medication changes can occur prior to pregnancy. In general, a prepregnancy serum creatinine level <133 mol/L (<1.5 mg/dL) is associated with a favorable prognosis. When renal disease worsens during pregnancy, close collaboration between the internist and the maternal-fetal medicine specialist is essential so that decisions regarding delivery can be weighed in the context of sequelae of prematurity for the neonate versus long-term sequelae for the mother with respect to future renal function.
 
Cardiac Disease

Valvular Heart Disease

(See also Chap. 237) This is the most common cardiac problem complicating pregnancy.

Mitral Stenosis

This is the valvular disease most likely to cause death during pregnancy. The pregnancy-induced increase in blood volume, cardiac output, and tachycardia can increase the transmitral pressure gradient and cause pulmonary edema in women with mitral stenosis. Pregnancy associated with long-standing mitral stenosis may result in pulmonary hypertension. Sudden death has been reported when hypovolemia occurs. Careful control of heart rate, especially during labor and delivery, minimizes the impact of tachycardia and reduced ventricular filling times on cardiac function. Pregnant women with mitral stenosis are at increased risk for the development of atrial fibrillation and other tachyarrhythmias. Medical management of severe mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation with digoxin and beta blockers is recommended. Balloon valvulotomy can be carried out during pregnancy. The immediate postpartum period is a time of particular concern secondary to rapid volume shifts. Careful monitoring of cardiac and fluid status should be observed.

Mitral Regurgitation and Aortic Regurgitation and Stenosis

These are generally well tolerated during pregnancy. The pregnancy-induced decrease in systemic vascular resistance reduces the risk of cardiac failure with these conditions. As a rule, mitral valve prolapse does not present problems for the pregnant patient, and aortic stenosis, unless very severe, is well tolerated. In the most severe cases of aortic stenosis, limitation of activity or balloon valvuloplasty may be indicated.

Congenital Heart Disease

(See also Chap. 236) The presence of a congenital cardiac lesion in the mother increases the risk of congenital cardiac disease in the newborn. Prenatal screening of the fetus for congenital cardiac disease with ultrasound is recommended. Atrial or ventricular septal defect is usually well tolerated during pregnancy in the absence of pulmonary hypertension, provided that the womans prepregnancy cardiac status is favorable. Use of air filters on IV sets during labor and delivery in patients with intracardiac shunts is recommended.

Other Cardiac Disorders

Supraventricular tachycardia (Chap. 233) is a common cardiac complication of pregnancy. Treatment is the same as in the nonpregnant patient, and fetal tolerance of medications such as adenosine and calcium channel blockers is acceptable. When necessary, pharmacologic or electric cardioversion may be performed to improve cardiac performance and reduce symptoms. This is generally well tolerated by mother and fetus.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy (Chap. 238) is an uncommon disorder of pregnancy associated with myocarditis, and its etiology remains unknown. Treatment is directed toward symptomatic relief and improvement of cardiac function. Many patients recover completely; others are left with a progressive dilated cardiomyopathy. Recurrence in a subsequent pregnancy has been reported, and women who do not have normal baseline left ventricular function after an episode of peripartum cardiomyopathy should be counseled to avoid pregnancy.

Specific High-Risk Cardiac Lesions

Marfan Syndrome

(See also Chap. 363) This is an autosomal dominant disease, associated with a high risk of maternal morbidity. Approximately 15% of pregnant women with Marfan syndrome develop a major cardiovascular manifestation during pregnancy, with almost all women surviving. An aortic root diameter <40 mm is considered to be associated with a favorable outcome of pregnancy. Prophylactic therapy with beta blockers has been advocated, although large-scale clinical trials in pregnancy have not been performed. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) may be associated with premature labor, and in type IV EDS, there is increased risk of uterine rupture.

Pulmonary Hypertension

(See also Chap. 250) Maternal mortality in the setting of severe pulmonary hypertension is high, and primary pulmonary hypertension is a contraindication to pregnancy. Termination of pregnancy may be advisable in these circumstances to preserve the life of the mother. In the Eisenmenger syndrome, i.e., the combination of pulmonary hypertension with right-to-left shunting due to congenital abnormalities (Chap. 236), maternal and fetal death occur frequently. Systemic hypotension may occur after blood loss, prolonged Valsalva maneuver, or regional anesthesia; sudden death secondary to hypotension is a dreaded complication. Management of these patients is challenging, and invasive hemodynamic monitoring during labor and delivery is recommended in severe cases.

In patients with pulmonary hypertension, vaginal delivery is less stressful hemodynamically than cesarean section, which should be reserved for accepted obstetric indications.
 
Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism

(See also Chap. 262)

A hypercoagulable state is characteristic of pregnancy, and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) occurs in about 1 in 2000 pregnancies. Pregnancy is associated with an increase in procoagulants such as factors V and VII, and a decrease in anticoagulant activity, including proteins C and S. Pulmonary embolism is one of the most common causes of maternal death in the United States. In pregnant women, DVT occurs much more commonly in the left leg than in the right leg, due to compression of the left iliac vein by the iliac artery and the uterus. Activated protein C resistance caused by the factor V Leiden mutation increases the risk for DVT and pulmonary embolism during pregnancy. Approximately 25% of women with DVT during pregnancy carry the factor V Leiden allele. Additional genetic mutations associated with DVT during pregnancy include the prothrombin G20210A mutation (heterozygotes and homozygotes) and the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T mutation (homozygotes).

Treatment: Deep Venous Thrombosis

Aggressive diagnosis and management of DVT and suspected pulmonary embolism optimize the outcome for mother and fetus. In general, all diagnostic and therapeutic modalities afforded the nonpregnant patient should be utilized in pregnancy. Anticoagulant therapy with low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin is indicated in pregnant women with DVT. LMWH may be associated with an increased risk of epidural hematoma in women receiving an epidural anesthetic in labor. Four weeks prior to anticipated delivery, LMWH should be switched to unfractionated heparin. Warfarin therapy is contraindicated in the first trimester due to its association with fetal chondrodysplasia punctata. In the second and third trimesters, warfarin may cause fetal optic atrophy and mental retardation. When DVT occurs in the postpartum period, LMWH therapy for 7¨C10 days may be followed by warfarin therapy for 3¨C6 months. Warfarin is not contraindicated in breast-feeding women. For women at moderate or high risk of DVT, mechanical or pharmacologic prophylaxis is warranted if they have a cesarean delivery.
 
Endocrine Disorders

Diabetes Mellitus

(See also Chap. 344) In pregnancy, the fetoplacental unit induces major metabolic changes, the purpose of which is to shunt glucose and amino acids to the fetus while the mother uses ketones and triglycerides to fuel her metabolic needs. These metabolic changes are accompanied by maternal insulin resistance, caused in part by placental production of steroids, a growth hormone variant, and placental lactogen. Although pregnancy has been referred to as a state of "accelerated starvation," it is better characterized as "accelerated ketosis." In pregnancy, after an overnight fast, plasma glucose is lower by 0.8¨C1.1 mmol/L (15¨C20 mg/dL) than in the nonpregnant state. This is due to the use of glucose by the fetus. In early pregnancy, fasting may result in circulating glucose concentrations in the range of 2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) and may be associated with symptoms of hypoglycemia. In contrast to the decrease in maternal glucose concentration, plasma hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate levels rise to two to four times normal after a fast.

Treatment: Diabetes Mellitus in Pregnancy

Pregnancy complicated by diabetes mellitus is associated with higher maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality rates. Preconception counseling and treatment are important for the diabetic patient contemplating pregnancy and can reduce the risk of congenital malformations and improve pregnancy outcome. Folate supplementation reduces the incidence of fetal neural tube defects, which occur with greater frequency in fetuses of diabetic mothers. In addition, optimizing glucose control during key periods of organogenesis reduces other congenital anomalies including sacral agenesis, caudal dysplasia, renal agenesis, and ventricular septal defect.

Once pregnancy is established, glucose control should be managed more aggressively than in the nonpregnant state. In addition to dietary changes, this requires more frequent blood glucose monitoring and often involves additional injections of insulin or conversion to an insulin pump. Fasting blood glucose levels should be maintained at <5.8 mmol/L (<105 mg/dL) with no values >7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL). Commencing in the third trimester, regular surveillance of maternal glucose control as well as assessment of fetal growth (obstetric sonography) and fetoplacental oxygenation (fetal heart rate monitoring or biophysical profile) optimizes pregnancy outcome. Pregnant diabetic patients without vascular disease are at greater risk for delivering a macrosomic fetus, and attention to fetal growth via clinical and ultrasound examination is important. Fetal macrosomia is associated with an increased risk of maternal and fetal birth trauma, including permanent newborn Erbs palsy. Pregnant women with diabetes have an increased risk of developing preeclampsia, and those with vascular disease are at greater risk for developing intrauterine growth restriction, which is associated with an increased risk of fetal and neonatal death. Excellent pregnancy outcomes in patients with diabetic nephropathy and proliferative retinopathy have been reported with aggressive glucose control and intensive maternal and fetal surveillance.

Glycemic control may become more difficult to achieve as pregnancy progresses due to an increase in insulin resistance. Because of delayed pulmonary maturation of the fetuses of diabetic mothers, early delivery should be avoided unless there is biochemical evidence of fetal lung maturity. In general, efforts to control glucose and avoid preterm delivery result in the best overall outcome for both mother and newborn. Preterm delivery is generally performed only for the usual obstetric indications (e.g., preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, non-reassuring fetal testing) or for worsening maternal renal or active proliferative retinopathy.

Gestational Diabetes

Gestational diabetes occurs in approximately 4% of pregnancies. All pregnant women should be screened for gestational diabetes unless they are in a low-risk group. Women at low risk for gestational diabetes are those <25 years of age; those with a body mass index < 25 kg/m2, no maternal history of macrosomia or gestational diabetes, and no diabetes in a first-degree relative; and those not members of a high-risk ethnic group (African American, Hispanic, Native American). A typical two-step strategy for establishing the diagnosis of gestational diabetes involves administration of a 50-g oral glucose challenge with a single serum glucose measurement at 60 min. If the plasma glucose is <7.8 mmol/L (<140 mg/dL), the test is considered normal. Plasma glucose > 7.8 mmol/L (>140 mg/dL) warrants administration of a 100-g oral glucose challenge with plasma glucose measurements obtained in the fasting state and at 1, 2, and 3 h. Normal values are plasma glucose concentrations <5.8 mmol/L (<105 mg/dL), 10.5 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), 9.1 mmol/L (165 mg/dL), and 8.0 mmol/L (145 mg/dL), respectively. Some centers have adopted more sensitive criteria, using <7.5 mmol/L (<130 mg/dL) as the screening threshold and values of <5.3 mmol/L (<95 mg/dL), <10 mmol/L (<180 mg/dL), <8.6 mmol/L (<155 mg/dL), and <7.8 mmol/L (<140 mg/dL) as the upper norms for a 3-h glucose tolerance test. Adverse pregnancy outcomes for mother and fetus appear to increase with glucose as a continuous variable, making it challenging to define the optimal threshold for establishing the diagnosis of gestational diabetes.

Pregnant women with gestational diabetes are at increased risk of stillbirth, preeclampsia, and delivering infants who are large for their gestational age with resulting birth lacerations, shoulder dystocia, and birth trauma including brachial plexus injury. Their fetuses are at risk of hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and polycythemia. Tight control of blood sugar during pregnancy and labor can reduce these risks.

Treatment of gestational diabetes with a two-step strategy of dietary intervention followed by insulin injections if diet alone does not adequately control blood sugar [fasting glucose < 5.6 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL) and 2-h post-prandial <7.0 mmol/L (<126 mg/dL)] is associated with a decreased risk of birth trauma for the fetus. Oral hypoglycemic agents such as glyburide and metformin have become more commonly utilized for managing gestational diabetes refractory to nutritional management. For women with gestational diabetes, within the 10 years after the index pregnancy there is a 40% risk of being diagnosed with diabetes. In women with a history of gestational diabetes, exercise, weight loss, and treatment with metformin reduce the risk of developing diabetes. All women with a history of gestational diabetes should be counseled about prevention strategies and evaluated regularly for diabetes.
 
Obesity

(See also Chap. 78) Pregnant women who are obese have an increased risk of stillbirth, congenital fetal malformations, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, urinary tract infections, and post-date deliveries. Women contemplating pregnancy should attempt to achieve a healthy weight prior to conception. For morbidly obese women who have not been able to achieve weight loss with lifestyle changes, bariatric surgery may result in weight loss and improve pregnancy outcomes. Following bariatric surgery, women should delay conception for one year to avoid pregnancy during an interval of rapid metabolic changes.

Thyroid Disease

(See also Chap. 341) In pregnancy, the estrogen-induced increase in thyroxine-binding globulin increases circulating levels of total T3 and total T4. The normal range of circulating levels of free T4, free T3, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) remain unaltered by pregnancy.

The thyroid gland normally enlarges during pregnancy. Maternal hyperthyroidism occurs at a rate of ~2 per 1000 pregnancies and is generally well tolerated by pregnant women. Clinical signs and symptoms should alert the physician to the occurrence of this disease. Many of the physiologic adaptations to pregnancy may mimic subtle signs of hyperthyroidism. Although pregnant women are able to tolerate mild hyperthyroidism without adverse sequelae, more severe hyperthyroidism can cause spontaneous abortion or premature labor, and thyroid storm is associated with a significant risk of maternal mortality.

Treatment: Hyperthyroidism in Pregnancy

Hyperthyroidism in pregnancy should be aggressively evaluated and treated. It is most commonly caused by Graves disease, but autonomously functioning nodules, gestational trophoblastic disease, thyroiditis, and hyperemesis gravidarum should also be considered. Methimazole crosses the placenta to a greater degree than propylthiouracil and has been associated with fetal aplasia cutis. However, propylthiouracil can be associated with liver failure. Some experts recommend propylthiouracil in the first trimester and methimazole thereafter. Radioiodine should not be used during pregnancy, either for scanning or treatment, because of effects on the fetal thyroid. In emergent circumstances, additional treatment with beta blockers and a saturated solution of potassium iodide may be necessary. Hyperthyroidism is most difficult to control in the first trimester of pregnancy and easiest to control in the third trimester.

Testing for hypothyroidism using TSH measurements before or early in pregnancy may be warranted in symptomatic women and women with a personal or family history of thyroid disease. Using this case-finding approach, about 30% of pregnant women with mild hypothyroidism will remain undiagnosed, leading some to recommend universal screening. Children born to women with an elevated serum TSH (and a normal total thyroxine) during pregnancy have impaired performance on neuropsychologic tests. The goal of therapy for hypothyroidism is to maintain the serum TSH in the normal range, and thyroxine is the drug of choice. During pregnancy, the dose of thyroxine required to keep the TSH in the normal range rises. In one study, the mean replacement dose of thyroxine required to maintain the TSH in the normal range was 0.1 mg daily before pregnancy, and it increased to 0.15 mg daily during pregnancy. Since the increased thyroxine requirement occurs as early as the fifth week of pregnancy, one approach is to increase the thyroxine dose by 30% as soon as pregnancy is diagnosed and then adjust the dose by serial measurements of TSH.
 
Hematologic Disorders

Pregnancy has been described as a state of physiologic anemia. Part of the reduction in hemoglobin concentration is dilutional, but iron and folate deficiencies are the major causes of correctable anemia during pregnancy.

In populations at high risk for hemoglobinopathies (Chap. 104), hemoglobin electrophoresis should be performed as part of the prenatal screen. Hemoglobinopathies can be associated with increased maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Management is tailored to the specific hemoglobinopathy and is generally the same for both pregnant and nonpregnant women. Prenatal diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies in the fetus is readily available and should be discussed with prospective parents either prior to or early in pregnancy.

Thrombocytopenia occurs commonly during pregnancy. The majority of cases are benign gestational thrombocytopenias, but the differential diagnosis should include immune thrombocytopenia (Chap. 115), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and preeclampsia. Maternal thrombocytopenia may also be caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is a consumptive coagulopathy characterized by thrombocytopenia, prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), elevated fibrin degradation products, and a low fibrinogen concentration. Several catastrophic obstetric events are associated with the development of DIC, including retention of a dead fetus, sepsis, abruptio placenta, and amniotic fluid embolism.
 
Neurologic Disorders

Headache appearing during pregnancy is usually due to migraine (Chap. 14), a condition that may worsen, improve, or be unaffected by pregnancy. A new or worsening headache, particularly if associated with visual blurring, may signal eclampsia (above) or pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) (Chap. 28); diplopia due to a sixth-nerve palsy suggests pseudotumor cerebri. The risk of seizures in patients with epilepsy increases in the postpartum period but not consistently during pregnancy; management is discussed in Chap. 369. The risk of stroke is generally thought to increase during pregnancy because of a hypercoagulable state; however, studies suggest that the period of risk occurs primarily in the postpartum period and that both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes may occur at this time. Guidelines for use of heparin therapy are summarized above (see "Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism"); warfarin is teratogenic and should be avoided.

The onset of a new movement disorder during pregnancy suggests chorea gravidarum, a variant of Sydenhams chorea associated with rheumatic fever and streptococcal infection (Chap. 322); the chorea may recur with subsequent pregnancies. Patients with preexisting multiple sclerosis (MS) (Chap. 380) experience a gradual decrease in the risk of relapses as pregnancy progresses and, conversely, an increase in attack risk during the postpartum period. Beta interferons should not be administered to pregnant MS patients, but moderate or severe relapses can be safely treated with pulse glucocorticoid therapy. Finally, certain tumors, particularly pituitary adenoma and meningioma (Chap. 379), may manifest during pregnancy because of accelerated growth, possibly driven by hormonal factors.

Peripheral nerve disorders associated with pregnancy include Bells palsy (idiopathic facial paralysis) (Chap. 384), which is approximately threefold more likely to occur during the third trimester and immediate postpartum period than in the general population. Therapy with glucocorticoids should follow the guidelines established for nonpregnant patients. Entrapment neuropathies are common in the later stages of pregnancy, presumably as a result of fluid retention. Carpal tunnel syndrome (median nerve) presents as pain and paresthesia in the hand, often worse at night, and later with weakness in the thenar muscles. Treatment is generally conservative; wrist splints may be helpful, and glucocorticoid injections or surgical section of the carpal tunnel can usually be postponed. Meralgia paresthetica (lateral femoral cutaneous nerve) consists of pain and numbness in the lateral aspect of the thigh without weakness. Patients are usually reassured to learn that these symptoms are benign and can be expected to remit spontaneously after the pregnancy has been completed. Restless leg syndrome is the most common peripheral nerve and movement disorder in pregnancy. Disordered iron metabolism is the suspected etiology. Management is expectant in most cases.
 
Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease

Up to 90% of pregnant women experience nausea and vomiting during the first trimester of pregnancy. Hyperemesis gravidarum is a severe form that prevents adequate fluid and nutritional intake and may require hospitalization to prevent dehydration and malnutrition.

Crohns disease may be associated with exacerbations in the second and third trimesters. Ulcerative colitis is associated with disease exacerbations in the first trimester and during the early postpartum period. Medical management of these diseases during pregnancy is identical to the management in the nonpregnant state (Chap. 295).

Exacerbation of gall bladder disease is commonly observed during pregnancy. In part, this may be due to pregnancy-induced alteration in the metabolism of bile and fatty acids. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is generally a third-trimester event. Profound pruritus may accompany this condition, and it may be associated with increased fetal mortality. Placental bile salt deposition may contribute to progressive uteroplacental insufficiency. Therefore, regular fetal surveillance should be undertaken once the diagnosis of intrahepatic cholestasis is made. Favorable results with ursodiol have been reported.

Acute fatty liver is a rare complication of pregnancy. Frequently confused with the HELLP syndrome (see "Preeclampsia" above) and severe preeclampsia, the diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy may be facilitated by imaging studies and laboratory evaluation. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is generally characterized by markedly increased levels of bilirubin and ammonia and by hypoglycemia. Management of acute fatty liver of pregnancy is supportive; recurrence in subsequent pregnancies has been reported.

All pregnant women should be screened for hepatitis B. This information is important for pediatricians after delivery of the infant. All infants receive hepatitis B vaccine. Infants born to mothers who are carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen should also receive hepatitis B immune globulin as soon after birth as possible and preferably within the first 72 h. Screening for hepatitis C is recommended for individuals at high risk for exposure.
 
Infections

Bacterial Infections

Other than bacterial vaginosis, the most common bacterial infections during pregnancy involve the urinary tract (Chap. 288). Many pregnant women have asymptomatic bacteriuria, most likely due to stasis caused by progestational effects on ureteral and bladder smooth muscle and later in pregnancy due to compression effects of the enlarging uterus. In itself, this condition is not associated with an adverse outcome of pregnancy. However, if asymptomatic bacteriuria is left untreated, symptomatic pyelonephritis may occur. Indeed, ~75% of cases of pregnancy-associated pyelonephritis are the result of untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria. All pregnant women should be screened with a urine culture for asymptomatic bacteriuria at the first prenatal visit. Subsequent screening with nitrite/leukocyte esterase strips is indicated for high-risk women, such as those with sickle cell trait or a history of urinary tract infections. All women with positive screens should be treated. Pregnant women who develop pyelonephritis need careful monitoring, including inpatient IV antibiotic administration due to the elevated risk of urosepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome in pregnancy.

Abdominal pain and fever during pregnancy create a clinical dilemma. The diagnosis of greatest concern is intrauterine amniotic infection. While amniotic infection most commonly follows rupture of the membranes, this is not always the case. In general, antibiotic therapy is not recommended as a temporizing measure in these circumstances. If intrauterine infection is suspected, induced delivery with concomitant antibiotic therapy is generally indicated. Intrauterine amniotic infection is most often caused by pathogens such as Escherichia coli and group B streptococcus. In high-risk patients at term or in preterm patients, routine intrapartum prophylaxis of group B streptococcal (GBS) disease is recommended. Penicillin G and ampicillin are the drugs of choice. In penicillin-allergic patients, with a low risk of anaphylaxis, cefazolin is recommended. If the patient is at high risk of anaphylaxis, vancomycin is recommended. If the organism is known to be sensitive to clindamycin, this antibiotic may be used. For the reduction of neonatal morbidity due to GBS, universal screening of pregnant women for GBS between 35 and 37 weeks gestation with intrapartum antibiotic treatment of infected women is recommended.

Postpartum infection is a significant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Postpartum endomyometritis is more common after cesarean delivery than vaginal delivery and develops in 5% of women after elective repeat cesarean section and in up to 25% after emergency cesarean section, following prolonged labor. Prophylactic antibiotics should be given to all patients undergoing cesarean section, and administration 30¨C60 minutes prior to skin incision may be preferable to administration at the time of umbilical cord clamping. As most cases of postpartum endomyometritis are polymicrobial, broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with a penicillin, aminoglycoside, and metronidazole is recommended (Chap. 164). Most cases resolve within 72 h. Women who do not respond to antibiotic treatment for postpartum endomyometritis should be evaluated for septic pelvic thrombophlebitis. Imaging studies may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis, which is primarily a clinical diagnosis of exclusion. Patients with septic pelvic thrombophlebitis generally have tachycardia out of proportion to their fever and respond rapidly to intravenous administration of heparin.

All patients are screened prenatally for gonorrhea and chlamydial infections, and the detection of either should result in prompt treatment. Ceftriaxone and azithromycin are the agents of choice (Chaps. 144 and 176).

Viral Infections

Cytomegalovirus Infection

Viral infection in pregnancy presents a significant challenge. The most common cause of congenital viral infection in the United States is cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Chap. 182). As many as 50¨C90% of women of childbearing age have antibodies to CMV, but only rarely does CMV reactivation result in neonatal infection. More commonly, primary CMV infection during pregnancy creates a risk of congenital CMV. No currently accepted treatment of CMV during pregnancy has been demonstrated to protect the fetus effectively. Moreover, it is difficult to predict which fetus will sustain a life-threatening CMV infection. Severe CMV disease in the newborn is characterized most often by petechiae, hepatosplenomegaly, and jaundice. Chorioretinitis, microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, hepatitis, hemolytic anemia, and purpura may also develop. CNS involvement, resulting in the development of psychomotor, ocular, auditory, and dental abnormalities over time, has been described.

Rubella

(See also Chap. 193) Rubella virus is a known teratogen; first-trimester rubella carries a high risk of fetal anomalies, though the risk decreases significantly later in pregnancy. Congenital rubella may be diagnosed by percutaneous umbilical blood sampling with the detection of IgM antibodies in fetal blood. All pregnant women should be screened for their immune status to rubella. Indeed, all women of childbearing age, regardless of pregnancy status, should have their immune status for rubella verified and be immunized if necessary. The incidence of congenital rubella in the United States is extremely low.

Herpesvirus

(See also Chap. 179) The acquisition of genital herpes during pregnancy is associated with spontaneous abortion, prematurity, and congenital and neonatal herpes. A recent cohort study of pregnant women without evidence of previous herpes infection demonstrated that ~2% of the women acquired a new herpes infection during the pregnancy. Approximately 60% of the newly infected women had no clinical symptoms. Infection occurred equally in all three trimesters. If herpes seroconversion occurred early in pregnancy, the risk of transmission to the newborn was very low. In women who acquired genital herpes shortly before delivery, the risk of transmission was high. The risk of active genital herpes lesions at term can be reduced by prescribing acyclovir for the last four weeks of pregnancy to women who have had their first episode of genital herpes during the pregnancy.

Herpesvirus infection in the newborn can be devastating. Disseminated neonatal herpes carries with it high mortality and morbidity rates from CNS involvement. It is recommended that pregnant women with active genital herpes lesions at the time of presentation in labor be delivered by cesarean section.

Parvovirus

(See also Chap. 184) Parvovirus infection (human parvovirus B19) may occur during pregnancy. It rarely causes sequelae, but susceptible women infected during pregnancy may be at risk for fetal hydrops secondary to erythroid aplasia and profound anemia.

HIV Infection

(See also Chap. 189) The predominant cause of HIV infection in children is transmission of the virus from the mother to the newborn during the perinatal period. HIV infection with high maternal viral load; low maternal CD4+ T cell count; prolonged labor; prolonged length of membrane rupture; and the presence of other genital tract infections, such as syphilis or herpes, increase the risk of transmission. Advances in antiretroviral therapy now make it possible for many pregnant women to have no detectable viral load as they approach term. These women may elect to attempt a vaginal birth. To reduce the risk of mother-to-newborn transmission, women should be treated during the intrapartum interval with zidovudine and the newborn should also be treated after birth. Breast-feeding may also transmit HIV to the newborn and is therefore contraindicated in most developed countries for HIV-infected mothers.
 
Summary

Maternal death is defined as the death occurring during pregnancy or within 42 days of completion of the pregnancy from a cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy, but not from accident or incidental causes. Maternal mortality has decreased steadily during the past 70 years. The maternal death rate has decreased from nearly 600/100,000 live births in 1935 to 13/100,000 live births in 2006. The most common causes of maternal death in the United States today are pulmonary embolism, obstetric hemorrhage, hypertension, sepsis, cardiovascular conditions including peripartum cardiomyopathy, and ectopic pregnancy. With improved diagnostic and therapeutic modalities as well as with advances in the treatment of infertility, more patients with medical complications will be seeking, and be in need of, complex obstetric care. Improving outcome of pregnancy in these women will be best obtained by assembling a team of internists, specialists in maternal-fetal medicine (high-risk obstetrics), and anesthesiologists to counsel these patients about the risks of pregnancy and to plan their treatment prior to conception. The importance of preconception counseling cannot be overstated. It is the responsibility of all physicians caring for women in the reproductive age group to assess their patients reproductive plans as part of their overall health evaluation.

Global Considerations

The maternal mortality ratio in the United States is about 1 in 7500 live births. In some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, the maternal mortality ratio is about 1 in 100 to 1 in 200 live births. The most common cause of maternal mortality in these countries is maternal hemorrhage. The high maternal death rate is due, in part, to inadequate resources, including lack of contraceptive and family-planning services, insufficient number of skilled birth attendants, limited availability of tocolytics, poor nutrition, and a high burden of infectious disease. The high rate of death from peripartum hemorrhage is due, in part, to inadequate access to anesthesia resources, blood-transfusion services, antibiotics, and skilled pelvic surgeons. Maternal death is a global public-health tragedy that could be improved with the application of modest resources.

Medical Evaluation of the Surgical Patient: Introduction

Cardiovascular and pulmonary complications continue to account for major morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Emerging evidence-based practices dictate that the internist should perform an individualized evaluation of the surgical patient to provide an accurate preoperative risk assessment and stratification to guide optimum perioperative risk-reduction strategies. This chapter reviews cardiovascular and pulmonary preoperative risk assessment, targeting intermediate- and high-risk patients to strategically guide perioperative therapies to improve outcome. It also reviews perioperative management and prophylaxis of diabetes mellitus, endocarditis, and venous thromboembolism.
 
Anesthetics

Mortality is low with safe delivery of modern anesthesia, especially in low-risk patients undergoing low-risk surgery (Table 8-1). Inhaled anesthetics have predictable circulatory and respiratory effects; all decrease arterial pressure in a dose-dependent manner by reducing sympathetic tone, causing systemic vasodilation, myocardial depression, and decreased cardiac output. Inhaled anesthetics also cause respiratory depression with diminished responses to both hypercapnia and hypoxemia in a dose-dependent manner, and they have a variable effect on heart rate. In combination with neuromuscular blockade, inhaled anesthetic agents also cause reduction in functional residual lung capacity due to loss of diaphragmatic and intercostal muscle function. This decreases lung volume, which may lead to atelectasis in the dependent lung regions and, in turn, may result in arterial hypoxemia from ventilation-perfusion mismatch as well as an increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications.

Several meta-analyses have shown that overall mortality was lower in patients receiving neuroaxial anesthesia (epidural or spinal) as compared to general (inhaled) anesthesia. Lower rates of venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, and respiratory depression were also observed in patients who were provided neuroaxial anesthesia; however, there were no significant differences in cardiac events between the two approaches. A combination of neuroaxial blockade and general anesthesia is useful when it is desired to reduce general anesthesia requirements. Evidence from a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials also supports postoperative epidural analgesia for the purpose of pain relief for more than 24 h.
 
Evaluation of Intermediate- to High-Risk Patients

Simple, standardized preoperative screening questionnaires, such as the one shown in Table 8-2, have been developed for the purpose of identifying patients at intermediate or high risk who may benefit from a more detailed clinical evaluation. Evaluation of such patients for operation should always begin with a thorough history and physical examination and with a 12-lead resting ECG, in accordance with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline recommendations. The history should focus on symptoms of occult cardiac or pulmonary disease. The urgency of the surgery should be determined, as true emergency procedures are associated with an unavoidably higher morbidity and mortality. Preoperative laboratory testing should be carried out only for specific clinical conditions based on the clinical examination. Thus, healthy patients of any age undergoing elective surgical procedures without coexisting medical conditions should not require any testing unless the degree of surgical stress may result in unusual changes from the baseline state.

Preoperative Cardiac Risk Assessment

Assessment of exercise tolerance in the prediction of in-hospital perioperative risk is most helpful in patients who self-report worsening, exercise-induced cardiopulmonary symptoms; those who may benefit from noninvasive or invasive cardiac testing regardless of scheduled surgical procedure; and those with known coronary artery disease (CAD) or with multiple risk factors who are able to exercise. For predicting perioperative events, poor exercise tolerance has been defined as the inability to walk four blocks or climb two flights of stairs at a normal pace or to meet a metabolic equivalent (MET) level of four (e.g., carrying objects of 15¨C20 lb or playing golf or doubles tennis) because of the development of dyspnea, angina, or excessive fatigue (Table 8-3).

Previous studies have prospectively compared several cardiac risk indices. Given its accuracy and simplicity, the revised cardiac risk index (RCRI) (Table 8-4) is favored. The RCRI relies on the presence or absence of six identifiable predictive factors, which include high-risk surgery, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and renal dysfunction. Each of these predictors is assigned one point. The risk of major cardiac events¡ªdefined as myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema, ventricular fibrillation or primary cardiac arrest, and complete heart block¡ªcan then be predicted. Based on the presence of none, one, two, three, or more of these clinical predictors, the rate of development of one of these major cardiac events is estimated to be 0.5, 1, 5, and 10%, respectively (Fig. 8-1). RCRI 0 has 0.4¨C0.5% risk of cardiac events; RCRI 1 has 0.9¨C1.3%; RCRI 2 has 4¨C6.6%; and RCRI 3 has 9¨C11% risk of cardiac events. The clinical utility of the RCRI is to identify patients with three or more predictors who are at higher risk (10%) for cardiac complications and who may benefit from further risk stratification with noninvasive cardiac testing or initiation of preoperative preventive medical management.

Preoperative Noninvasive Cardiac Testing for Risk Stratification

There is little evidence to support widespread application of preoperative noninvasive cardiac testing for all patients undergoing major surgery. Rather, a discriminate approach based on clinical risk categorization appears to be both useful clinically and cost-effective. There is potential benefit in identifying asymptomatic but high-risk patients, such as those with left main or left main¨Cequivalent CAD or those with three-vessel CAD with poor left ventricular function who may benefit from coronary revascularization (Chap. 243). However, evidence does not support aggressive attempts to identify patients at intermediate risk with asymptomatic but advanced coronary artery disease, because coronary revascularization appears to offer little advantage over medical therapy.

An RCRI score 3 in patients with severe myocardial ischemia on stress testing should lead to consideration of coronary revascularization prior to noncardiac surgery. Noninvasive cardiac testing is most appropriate if it is anticipated that in the event of a strongly positive test a patient will meet guidelines for coronary angiography and coronary revascularization. Pharmacologic stress tests are more useful than exercise testing in patients with functional limitations. Dobutamine echocardiography and persantine, adenosine, or dobutamine nuclear perfusion testing (Chap. 229) have excellent negative predictive values (near 100%) but poor positive predictive values (< 20%) for identification of patients at risk for perioperative myocardial infarction or death. Thus, a negative study is reassuring, but a positive study is a relatively weak predictor of a "hard" perioperative cardiac event. A stepwise approach is illustrated in Fig. 8-2.

Risk Modification Using Preventive Strategies to Reduce Cardiac Risk

Perioperative Coronary Revascularization

Currently, potential options for reducing perioperative cardiovascular risk include coronary artery revascularization and/or perioperative medical preventive therapies (Chap. 243). Prophylactic coronary revascularization with either coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) provides no short- or midterm survival benefit for patients without left main CAD or three-vessel CAD in the presence of poor left ventricular systolic function. Although PCI is associated with lower procedural risk than is CABG in the perioperative setting, the placement of a coronary artery stent in a short period of time prior to noncardiac surgery may increase the risk of bleeding during surgery if dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and thienopyridine) is administered or it increases the perioperative risk of myocardial infarction and cardiac death due to stent thrombosis if such therapy is withdrawn prematurely (Chap. 246). It is recommended that, if possible, noncardiac surgery be delayed 30¨C45 days after placement of a bare metal coronary stent and 365 days after a drug-eluting stent. For patients who must undergo noncardiac surgery early (> 14 days) after PCI, balloon angioplasty without stent placement appears to be a reasonable alternative because dual antiplatelet therapy is not necessary in such patients.

Perioperative Medical Preventive Therapies

Perioperative preventive medical therapy with -adrenergic antagonists, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), and aspirin have the goal of reducing perioperative adrenergic stimulation, ischemia, and inflammation, which are triggered during the perioperative period.

-Adrenergic Antagonists

The use of perioperative beta blockade should be based on a thorough assessment of a patient's perioperative cardiac risk (RCRI  2). For patients with or without mild to moderate reactive airway disease, the cardioselective beta blocker of choice should be used and titrated to a target resting heart rate of 60¨C65 beats/minute. In intermediate- to high-risk patients without a long-term indication for beta blockers, the medications can be administered intravenously as a preoperative medication on the day of surgery, with a targeted heart rate of 60¨C65 beats/minute and continued for > 7 days (preferably 30 days) postoperatively. Intravenous preparations should be substituted for oral medication if patients are unable to take or absorb pills in the perioperative period. The results from the recent Perioperative Ischemic Evaluation (POISE) trial showed that although cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or cardiac arrest was reduced in the patients who received metoprolol as compared to placebo, there was an increased incidence of mortality and stroke in the patients receiving metoprolol because of a high and rapid loading dose of metoprolol. The POISE trial highlights the importance for a clear risk and benefit assessment with careful initiation and titration to therapeutic efficacy of preoperative beta blockers in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.

The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend the following: (1) Beta blockers should be continued in high-risk patients who previously received these drugs and undergo vascular surgery, and they should be administered to high-risk patients identified by myocardial ischemia on preoperative assessment who are scheduled to undergo vascular surgery. (2) Beta blockers are probably recommended for high-risk patients defined by multiple clinical predictors who undergo intermediate- or high-risk procedures. They may be considered for intermediate-risk patients who undergo intermediate- or high-risk procedures and for low-risk patients who undergo vascular surgery.

HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins)

A number of prospective and retrospective studies support the perioperative prophylactic use of statins for reduction of cardiac complications in patients with established atherosclerosis. The Dutch Echocardiographic Cardiac Risk Evaluation Applying Stress Echocardiography (DECREASE)-IV study, in addition to confirming the benefit of perioperative bisoprolol in lowering the risk of cardiac death or myocardial infarction at 30 days, demonstrated a reduced trend in cardiac events in intermediate-risk patients undergoing noncardiac surgery who receive fluvastatin therapy. The use of perioperative statin therapy to reduce perioperative cardiac risk should, therefore, be considered in intermediate- or high-risk patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who are undergoing major noncardiac surgery.

Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors

Evidence supports the discontinuation of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for 24 hours prior to noncardiac surgery due to adverse circulatory effects after induction of anesthesia.

Oral Antiplatelet Agents

Evidence-based recommendations regarding perioperative use of aspirin and/or thienopyridine to reduce cardiac risk currently lack clarity. A substantial increase in perioperative bleeding and transfusion requirement in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy has been observed. The discontinuation of thienopyridine and aspirin for 5¨C7 days prior to major surgery to minimize the risk of perioperative bleeding and transfusion must be balanced with the potential increased risk of an acute coronary syndrome and of subacute stent thrombosis in patients with recent coronary stent implantation. If clinicians elect to withhold antiplatelet agents prior to surgery, they should be restarted as soon as possible postoperatively.

Calcium Channel Blockers

Evidence is lacking to support the use of calcium channel blockers as a prophylactic strategy to decrease perioperative risk in major noncardiac surgery.

Preoperative Pulmonary Assessment

Perioperative pulmonary complications occur frequently and lead to significant morbidity and mortality. The guidelines from the American College of Physicians recommend the following:

All patients undergoing noncardiac surgery should be assessed for risk of pulmonary complications (Table 8-5).

Patients undergoing emergency or prolonged (>3 h) surgery; aortic aneurysm repair; vascular surgery; major abdominal, thoracic, neuro, head, or neck surgery; and general anesthesia should be considered to be at higher risk for postoperative pulmonary complications.

Patients at higher risk of pulmonary complications should receive deep breathing exercises and/or incentive spirometry as well as selective use of a nasogastric tube for postoperative nausea, vomiting, or symptomatic abdominal distention to reduce postoperative risk (Table 8-6).

Routine preoperative spirometry and chest radiography are less helpful for predicting risk of postoperative pulmonary complications, but may be appropriate for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma.

Pulmonary artery catheterization, total parenteral nutrition, and total enteral nutrition are not encouraged for postoperative pulmonary risk reduction.

Other Preoperative Pulmonary Risk-Modification Strategies

Risk-modification strategies to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications should be implemented, particularly in higher-risk patients. Patients with cough or dyspnea preoperatively should be evaluated to determine the underlying cause of these symptoms. Patients who smoke should be counseled to quit for at least eight weeks prior to elective surgery. Patients with asthma or COPD can be given steroids and bronchodilators pre- and postoperatively to optimize pulmonary function. Bacterial pulmonary infection should be treated preoperatively.

Diabetes Mellitus

(See also Chap. 344) Many patients with diabetes mellitus have significant symptomatic or asymptomatic CAD and may have silent myocardial ischemia due to autonomic dysfunction. Evidence supports intensive perioperative glycemic control to achieve near-normal glucose levels (90¨C110 mg/dL) versus moderate glycemic control (120¨C200 mg/dL), using insulin infusion. This practice must be balanced against the risk of hypoglycemic complications. Oral hypoglycemic agonists should be held on the morning of operation. Perioperative hyperglycemia should be treated with intravenous infusion of short-acting insulin or subcutaneous sliding-scale insulin. Patients who are diet-controlled may proceed to surgery with close postoperative monitoring.

Prophylaxis for Infective Endocarditis

(See also Chap. 124) Perioperative prophylactic antibiotics should be administered to patients with congenital or valvular heart disease, prosthetic valves, mitral valve prolapse, or other cardiac abnormalities in accordance with ACC/AHA practice guidelines.

Prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism

(See also Chap. 262) Perioperative prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism should follow established guidelines of the American College of Chest Physicians. Aspirin is not supported as a single agent for thromboprophylaxis. Low-dose unfractionated heparin (5000 units subcutaneous bid), low-molecular weight heparin (e.g., enoxaparin 30 mg bid or 40 mg qd) or a pentasaccharide (fondaparinux 2.5 mg qd) for patients at moderate risk, and unfractionated heparin (5000 units subcutaneous tid) for patients at high risk. Graduated compression stockings and pneumatic compression devices are useful supplements to anticoagulant therapy.

Epidemiology

In 2007, 2,423,712 individuals died in the United States (Table 9-1). Approximately 72% of all deaths occur in those >65 years of age. The epidemiology of mortality is similar in most developed countries; cardiovascular diseases and cancer are the predominant causes of death, a marked change since 1900, when heart disease caused ~8% of all deaths and cancer accounted for <4% of all deaths. In 2006, the year with the most recent available data, AIDS accounted for <1% of all U.S. deaths, although among those age 35¨C44, it remained one of the top five causes.

It is estimated that in developed countries ~70% of all deaths are preceded by a disease or condition, making it reasonable to plan for dying in the foreseeable future. Cancer has served as the paradigm for terminal care, but it is not the only type of illness with a recognizable and predictable terminal phase. Since heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic liver failure, dementia, and many other conditions have recognizable terminal phases, a systematic approach to end-of-life care should be part of all medical specialties. Many patients with illness-related suffering also can benefit from palliative care regardless of prognosis. Ideally, palliative care should be considered part of comprehensive care for all patients. Reviews of the recent literature have found strong evidence that palliative care can be improved by coordination between caregivers, doctors, and patients for advance care planning, as well as dedicated teams of physicians, nurses, and other providers.

The rapid increases in life expectancy in the United States over the last century have been accompanied by new difficulties facing individuals, families, and society as a whole in addressing the needs of an aging population. These challenges include both more complicated conditions and technologies to address them at the end of life. The development of technologies that can prolong life without restoring full health has led many Americans to seek out alternative end-of-life care settings and approaches that relieve suffering for those with terminal diseases. Over the last few decades in the United States, a significant change in the site of death has occurred that coincides with patient and family preferences. Nearly 60% of Americans died as inpatients in hospitals in 1980. By 2000, the trend was reversing, with ~40% of Americans dying as hospital inpatients (Fig. 9-1). This shift has been most dramatic for those dying from cancer and COPD and for younger and very old individuals. In the last decade, it has been associated with the increased use of hospice care; in 2008, approximately 39% of all decedents in the United States received such care. Cancer patients currently constitute ~38.3% of hospice users. About 79% of patients receiving hospice care die out of the hospital, and around 41% of those receiving hospice care die in a private residence. In addition, in 2008, for the first time, the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) offered certification in hospice and palliative medicine. With shortening of hospital stays, many serious conditions are being treated at home or on an outpatient basis. Consequently, providing optimal palliative and end-of-life care requires ensuring that appropriate services are available in a variety of settings, including noninstitutional settings.

Hospice and the Palliative Care Framework

Central to this type of care is an interdisciplinary team approach that typically encompasses pain and symptom management, spiritual and psychological care for the patient, and support for family caregivers during the patients illness and the bereavement period.

Terminally ill patients have a wide variety of advanced diseases, often with multiple symptoms that demand relief, and require noninvasive therapeutic regimens to be delivered in flexible care settings. Fundamental to ensuring quality palliative and end-of-life care is a focus on four broad domains: (1) physical symptoms; (2) psychological symptoms; (3) social needs that include interpersonal relationships, caregiving, and economic concerns; and (4) existential or spiritual needs.

A comprehensive assessment screens for and evaluates needs in each of these four domains. Goals for care are established in discussions with the patient and/or family, based on the assessment in each of the domains. Interventions then are aimed at improving or managing symptoms and needs. Although physicians are responsible for certain interventions, especially technical ones, and for coordinating the interventions, they cannot be responsible for providing all of them. Since failing to address any one of the domains is likely to preclude a good death, a well-coordinated, effectively communicating interdisciplinary team takes on special importance in end-of-life care. Depending on the setting, critical members of the interdisciplinary team will include physicians, nurses, social workers, chaplains, nurses aides, physical therapists, bereavement counselors, and volunteers.

Assessment and Care Planning

Comprehensive Assessment

Standardized methods for conducting a comprehensive assessment focus on evaluating the patients condition in all four domains affected by illness: physical, psychological, social, and spiritual. The assessment of physical and mental symptoms should follow a modified version of the traditional medical history and physical examination that emphasizes symptoms. Questions should aim at elucidating symptoms and discerning sources of suffering and gauging how much those symptoms interfere with the patients quality of life. Standardized assessment is critical. Currently, there are 21 symptom assessment instruments for cancer alone. Further research on and validation of these assessment tools, especially taking into account patient perspectives, could improve their effectiveness. Instruments with good psychometric properties that assess a wide range of symptoms include the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS), the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist, the Worthing Chemotherapy Questionnaire, and the Computerized Symptom Assessment Instrument. These instruments are long and may be useful for initial clinical or for research assessments. Shorter instruments are useful for patients whose performance status does not permit comprehensive assessments. Suitable shorter instruments include the Condensed Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale, the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System, the M.D. Anderson Symptom Assessment Inventory, and the Symptom Distress Scale. Using such instruments ensures that the assessment is comprehensive and does not focus only on pain and a few other physical symptoms. Invasive tests are best avoided in end-of-life care, and even minimally invasive tests should be evaluated carefully for their benefit-to-burden ratio for the patient. Aspects of the physical examination that are uncomfortable and unlikely to yield useful information can be omitted.

Regarding social needs, health care providers should assess the status of important relationships, financial burdens, caregiving needs, and access to medical care. Relevant questions will include the following: How often is there someone to feel close to? How has this illness been for your family? How has it affected your relationships? How much help do you need with things like getting meals and getting around? How much trouble do you have getting the medical care you need? In the area of existential needs, providers should assess distress and the patients sense of being emotionally and existentially settled and of finding purpose or meaning. Helpful assessment questions can include the following: How much are you able to find meaning since your illness began? What things are most important to you at this stage? In addition, it can be helpful to ask how the patient perceives his or her care: How much do you feel your doctors and nurses respect you? How clear is the information from us about what to expect regarding your illness? How much do you feel that the medical care you are getting fits with your goals? If concern is detected in any of these areas, deeper evaluative questions are warranted.

Communication

Especially when an illness is life-threatening, there are many emotionally charged and potentially conflict-creating moments, collectively called "bad news" situations, in which empathic and effective communication skills are essential. Those moments include communicating with the patient and/or family about a terminal diagnosis, the patients prognosis, any treatment failures, deemphasizing efforts to cure and prolong life while focusing more on symptom management and palliation, advance care planning, and the patients death. Although these conversations can be difficult and lead to tension, research indicates that end-of-life discussions can lead to earlier hospice referrals rather than overly aggressive treatment, benefiting quality of life for patients and improving the bereavement process for families.

Just as surgeons plan and prepare for major operations and investigators rehearse a presentation of research results, physicians and health care providers caring for patients with significant or advanced illness can develop a practiced approach to sharing important information and planning interventions. In addition, families identify as important both how well the physician was prepared to deliver bad news and the setting in which it was delivered. For instance, 27% of families making critical decisions for patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) desired better and more private physical space to communicate with physicians, and 48% found having clergy present reassuring.

An organized and effective seven-step procedure for communicating bad news goes by the acronym P-SPIKES: (1) prepare for the discussion, (2) set up a suitable environment, (3) begin the discussion by finding out what the patient and/or family understand, (4) determine how they will comprehend new information best and how much they want to know, (5) provide needed new knowledge accordingly, (6) allow for emotional responses, and (7) share plans for the next steps in care. Table 9-2 provides a summary of these steps along with suggested phrases and underlying rationales for each one. Additional research that further considers the response of patients to systematic methods of delivering bad news could build the evidence base for even more effective communication procedures.

Continuous Goal Assessment

Major barriers to ensuring quality palliative and end-of-life care include difficulty providing an accurate prognosis and emotional resistance of patients and their families to accepting the implications of a poor prognosis. A practical solution to these barriers is to integrate palliative care with curative care regardless of prognosis. With this approach, palliative care no longer conveys the message of failure, having no more treatments, or "giving up hope." Fundamental to integrating palliative care with curative therapy is to include continuous goal assessment as part of the routine patient reassessment that occurs at most patient-physician encounters.

Goals for care are numerous, ranging from cure of a specific disease, to prolonging life, to relief of a symptom, to delaying the course of an incurable disease, to adapting to progressive disability without disrupting the family, to finding peace of mind or personal meaning, to dying in a manner that leaves loved ones with positive memories. Discernment of goals for care can be approached through a seven-step protocol: (1) ensure that medical and other information is as complete as reasonably possible and is understood by all relevant parties (see above); (2) explore what the patient and/or family are hoping for while identifying relevant and realistic goals; (3) share all the options with the patient and family; (4) respond with empathy as they adjust to changing expectations; (5) make a plan, emphasizing what can be done toward achieving the realistic goals; (6) follow through with the plan; and (7) review and revise the plan periodically, considering at every encounter whether the goals of care should be reviewed with the patient and/or family. Each of these steps need not be followed in rote order, but together they provide a helpful framework for interactions with patients and their families about goals for care. It can be especially challenging if a patient or family member has difficulty letting go of an unrealistic goal. One strategy is to help them refocus on more realistic goals and also suggest that while hoping for the best, it is still prudent to plan for other outcomes as well.

Advance Care Planning

Practices

Advance care planning is a process of planning for future medical care in case the patient becomes incapable of making medical decisions. A 2010 study of adults 60 or older who died between 2000 and 2006 found that 42% required decision-making about treatment in the final days of life but 70% lacked decision-making capacity. Among those lacking decision-making capacity, around one-third did not have advance planning directives. Ideally, such planning would occur before a health care crisis or the terminal phase of an illness. Unfortunately, diverse barriers prevent this. Although 80% of Americans endorse advance care planning and completing living wills, only 47% have actually done so. Most patients expect physicians to initiate advance care planning and will wait for physicians to broach the subject. Patients also wish to discuss advance care planning with their families. Yet patients with unrealistic expectations are significantly more likely to prefer aggressive treatments. Fewer than one-third of health care providers have completed advance care planning for themselves. Hence, a good first step is for health care providers to complete their own advance care planning. This makes providers aware of the critical choices in the process and the issues that are especially charged and allows them to tell their patients truthfully that they personally have done advance planning.

Steps in effective advance care planning center on (1) introducing the topic, (2) structuring a discussion, (3) reviewing plans that have been discussed by the patient and family, (4) documenting the plans, (5) updating them periodically, and (6) implementing the advance care directives (Table 9-3). Two of the main barriers to advance care planning are problems in raising the topic and difficulty in structuring a succinct discussion. Raising the topic can be done efficiently as a routine matter, noting that it is recommended for all patients, analogous to purchasing insurance or estate planning. Many of the most difficult cases have involved unexpected, acute episodes of brain damage in young individuals.

Table 9-3 Steps in Advance Care Planning

 
 
Step Goals to be Achieved and Measures to Cover Useful Phrases or Points to Make 
Introducing advance care planning Ask the patient what he or she knows about advance care planning and if he or she has already completed an advance care directive. 

Indicate that you as a physician have completed advance care planning. 

Indicate that you try to perform advance care planning with all patients regardless of prognosis.

Explain the goals of the process as empowering the patient and ensuring that you and the proxy understand the patient's preferences. 

Provide the patient relevant literature, including the advance care directive that you prefer to use. 

Recommend the patient identify a proxy decision-maker who should attend the next meeting.
 I'd like to talk with you about something I try to discuss with all my patients. Its called advance care planning. In fact, I feel that this is such an important topic that I have done this myself. Are you familiar with advance care planning or living wills? 

Have you thought about the type of care you would want if you ever became too sick to speak for yourself? That is the purpose of advance care planning. 

There is no change in health that we have not discussed. I am bringing this up now because it is sensible for everyone, no matter how well or ill, old or young. 

Have many copies of advance care directives available, including in the waiting room, for patients and families. 

Know resources for state-specific forms (available at www.nhpco.org).
 
Structured discussion of scenarios and patient Affirm that the goal of the process is to follow the patient's wishes if the patient loses decision-making capacity. 

Elicit the patient's overall goals related to health care. 

Elicit the patient's preferences for specific interventions in a few salient and common scenarios. 

Help the patient define the threshold for withdrawing and withholding interventions. 

Define the patient's preference for the role of the proxy.
 Use a structured worksheet with typical scenarios. 

Begin the discussion with persistent vegetative state and consider other scenarios, such as recovery from an acute event with serious disability, asking the patient about his or her preferences regarding specific interventions, such as ventilators, artificial nutrition, and CPR, and then proceeding to less invasive interventions, such as blood transfusions and antibiotics.
 
Review the patient's preferences After the patient has made choices of interventions, review them to ensure they are consistent and the proxy is aware of them.   
Document the patient's preferences Formally complete the advance care directive and have a witness sign it. 

Provide a copy for the patient and the proxy. 

Insert a copy into the patient's medical record and summarize in a progress note.
   
Update the directive Periodically, and with major changes in health status, review the directive with the patient and make any modifications.   
Apply the directive The directive goes into effect only when the patient becomes unable to make medical decisions for himself or herself. 

Reread the directive to be sure about its content. 

Discuss your proposed actions based on the directive with the proxy.
   
 


Abbreviation: CPR, cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 
 

Structuring a focused discussion is a central communication skill. Identify the health care proxy and recommend his or her involvement in the process of advance care planning. Select a worksheet, preferably one that has been evaluated and demonstrated to produce reliable and valid expressions of patient preferences, and orient the patient and proxy to it. Such worksheets exist for both general and disease-specific situations. Discuss with the patient and proxy one scenario as an example to demonstrate how to think about the issues. It is often helpful to begin with a scenario in which the patient is likely to have settled preferences for care, such as being in a persistent vegetative state. Once the patients preferences for interventions in this scenario are determined, suggest that the patient and proxy discuss and complete the worksheet for the others. If appropriate, suggest that they involve other family members in the discussion. On a return visit, go over the patients preferences, checking and resolving any inconsistencies. After having the patient and proxy sign the document, place it in the medical chart and be sure that copies are provided to relevant family members and care sites. Since patients preferences can change, these documents have to be reviewed periodically.

Types of Documents

Advance care planning documents are of two broad types. The first includes living wills or instructional directives; these are advisory documents that describe the types of decisions that should direct care. Some are more specific, delineating different scenarios and interventions for the patient to choose from. Among these, some are for general use and others are designed for use by patients with a specific type of disease, such as cancer or HIV. Less specific directives can be general statements of not wanting life-sustaining interventions or forms that describe the values that should guide specific discussions about terminal care. The second type of advance directive allows the designation of a health care proxy (sometimes also referred to as a durable attorney for health care), who is an individual selected by the patient to make decisions. The choice is not either/or; a combined directive that includes a living will and designates a proxy is often used, and the directive should indicate clearly whether the specified patient preferences or the proxys choice takes precedence if they conflict. Some states have begun to put into practice a "Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST)" paradigm, which builds on communication between providers and patients to include guidance for end-of-life care in a color-coordinated form that follows the patient across treatment settings. The procedures for completing advance care planning documents vary according to state law.

A potentially misleading distinction relates to statutory as opposed to advisory documents. Statutory documents are drafted to fulfill relevant state laws. Advisory documents are drafted to reflect the patients wishes. Both are legal, the first under state law and the latter under common or constitutional law.

Legal Aspects

As of 2006, 48 states and the District of Columbia had enacted living will legislation. Many states have their own statutory forms. Massachusetts and Michigan do not have living will laws, although both have health care proxy laws. In 25 states, the laws state that the living will is not valid if a woman is pregnant. However, like all other states except Alaska, these states have enacted durable power of attorney for health care laws that permit patients to designate a proxy decision-maker with authority to terminate life-sustaining treatments. Only in Alaska does the law prohibit proxies from terminating life-sustaining treatments. The health reform legislation, the Affordable Care Act of 2010, raised substantial controversy when early versions of the law included Medicare reimbursement for advance care planning consultations. These provisions were withdrawn over accusations that they would lead to the rationing of care for the elderly.

The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that patients have a constitutional right to decide about refusing and terminating medical interventions, including life-sustaining interventions, and that mentally incompetent patients can exercise this right by providing "clear and convincing evidence" of their preferences. Since advance care directives permit patients to provide such evidence, commentators agree that they are constitutionally protected. Most commentators believe that a state is required to honor any clear advance care directive whether or not it is written on an "official" form. Many states have enacted laws explicitly to honor out-of-state directives. If a patient is not using a statutory form, it may be advisable to attach a statutory form to the advance care directive being used. State-specific forms are readily available free of charge for health care providers and patients and families through the website of the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (http://www.nhpco.org).
 
Interventions

Physical Symptoms and Their Management

Great emphasis has been placed on addressing dying patients pain. Some institutions have made pain assessment a fifth vital sign to emphasize its importance. This also has been advocated by large health care systems such as the Veterans Administration and accrediting bodies such as the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO). Although this embrace of pain as the fifth vital sign has been symbolically important, no data document that it has improved pain management practices. Although good palliative care requires good pain management, it also requires more. The frequency of symptoms varies by disease and other factors. The most common physical and psychological symptoms among all terminally ill patients include pain, fatigue, insomnia, anorexia, dyspnea, depression, anxiety, and nausea and vomiting. In the last days of life, terminal delirium is also common. Assessments of patients with advanced cancer have shown that patients experienced an average of 11.5 different physical and psychological symptoms (Table 9-4).

Evaluations to determine the etiology of these symptoms usually can be limited to the history and physical examination. In some cases, radiologic or other diagnostic examinations will provide sufficient benefit in directing optimal palliative care to warrant the risks, potential discomfort, and inconvenience, especially to a seriously ill patient. Only a few of the common symptoms that present difficult management issues will be addressed in this chapter. Additional information on the management of other symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting, insomnia, and diarrhea, can be found in Chaps. 39 and 81, Chap. 27, and Chap. 40, respectively.

Pain

Frequency

The frequency of pain among terminally ill patients varies widely. Substantial pain occurs in 36¨C90% of patients with advanced cancer. In the SUPPORT study of hospitalized patients with diverse conditions and an estimated survival 6 months, 22% reported moderate to severe pain, and caregivers of those patients noted that 50% had similar levels of pain during the last few days of life. A meta-analysis found pain prevalence of 58¨C69% in studies that included patients characterized as having advanced, metastatic, or terminal cancer; 44¨C73% in studies that included patients characterized as undergoing cancer treatment; and 21¨C46% in studies that included posttreatment individuals.

Etiology

Nociceptive pain is the result of direct mechanical or chemical stimulation of nociceptors and normal neural signaling to the brain. It tends to be localized, aching, throbbing, and cramping. The classic example is bone metastases. Visceral pain is caused by nociceptors in gastrointestinal, respiratory, and other organ systems. It is a deep or colicky type of pain classically associated with pancreatitis, myocardial infarction, or tumor invasion of viscera. Neuropathic pain arises from disordered nerve signals. It is described by patients as burning, electrical, or shocklike pain. Classic examples are poststroke pain, tumor invasion of the brachial plexus, and herpetic neuralgia.

Assessment

Pain is a subjective experience. Depending on the patients circumstances, perspective, and physiologic condition, the same physical lesion or disease state can produce different levels of reported pain and need for pain relief. Systematic assessment includes eliciting the following: (1) type: throbbing, cramping, burning, etc.; (2) periodicity: continuous, with or without exacerbations, or incident; (3) location; (4) intensity; (5) modifying factors; (6) effects of treatments; (7) functional impact; and (8) impact on patient. Several validated pain assessment measures may be used, such as the Visual Analogue Scale, the Brief Pain Inventory, and the pain component of one of the more comprehensive symptom assessment instruments. Frequent reassessments are essential to assess the effects of interventions.

Interventions

Interventions for pain must be tailored to each individual, with the goal of preempting chronic pain and relieving breakthrough pain. At the end of life, there is rarely reason to doubt a patients report of pain. Pain medications are the cornerstone of management. If they are failing and nonpharmacologic interventions¡ªincluding radiotherapy and anesthetic or neurosurgical procedures such as peripheral nerve blocks or epidural medications¡ªare required, a pain consultation is appropriate.

Pharmacologic interventions follow the World Health Organization three-step approach involving nonopioid analgesics, mild opioids, and strong opioids, with or without adjuvants (Chap. 11). Nonopioid analgesics, especially nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are the initial treatments for mild pain. They work primarily by inhibiting peripheral prostaglandins and reducing inflammation but also may have central nervous system (CNS) effects. They have a ceiling effect. Ibuprofen, up to 1600 mg/d qid, has a minimal risk of causing bleeding and renal impairment and is a good initial choice. In patients with a history of severe gastrointestinal (GI) or other bleeding, it should be avoided. In patients with a history of mild gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), acid-lowering therapy such as a proton pump inhibitor should be used. Acetaminophen is an alternative in patients with a history of GI bleeding and can be used safely at up to 4 g/d qid. In patients with liver dysfunction due to metastases or other causes and in patients with heavy alcohol use, doses should be reduced.

If nonopioid analgesics are insufficient, opioids should be introduced. They work by interacting with mu opioid receptors in the CNS to activate pain-inhibitory neurons; most are receptor antagonists. The mixed agonist/antagonist opioids useful for post-acute pain should not be used for the chronic pain in end-of-life care. Weak opioids such as codeine can be used initially. However, if they are escalated and fail to relieve pain, strong opioids such as morphine, 5¨C10 mg every 4 h, should be used. Nonopioid analgesics should be combined with opioids because they potentiate the effect of opioids.

For continuous pain, opioids should be administered on a regular, around-the-clock basis consistent with their duration of analgesia. They should not be provided only when the patient experiences pain; the goal is to prevent patients from experiencing pain. Patients also should be provided rescue medication, such as liquid morphine, for breakthrough pain, generally at 20% of the baseline dose. Patients should be informed that using the rescue medication does not obviate the need to take the next standard dose of pain medication. If after 24 h the patients pain remains uncontrolled and recurs before the next dose, requiring the patient to utilize the rescue medication, the daily opioid dose can be increased by the total dose of rescue medications used by the patient, or by 50% for moderate pain and 100% for severe pain of the standing opioid daily dose.

It is inappropriate to start with extended-release preparations. Instead, an initial focus on using short-acting preparations to determine how much is required in the first 24¨C48 h will allow clinicians to determine opioid needs. Once pain relief is obtained with short-acting preparations, one should switch to extended-release preparations. Even with a stable extended-release preparation regimen, the patient may have incident pain, such as during movement or dressing changes. Short-acting preparations should be taken before such predictable episodes. Although less common, patients may have "end-of-dose failure" with long-acting opioids, meaning that they develop pain after 8 h in the case of an every-12-h medication. In these cases, a trial of giving an every-12-h medication every 8 h is appropriate.

Because of differences in opioid receptors, cross-tolerance among opioids is incomplete, and patients may experience different side effects with different opioids. Therefore, if a patient is not experiencing pain relief or is experiencing too many side effects, a change to another opioid preparation is appropriate. When switching, one should begin with 50¨C75% of the published equianalgesic dose of the new opioid.

Unlike NSAIDs, opioids have no ceiling effect; therefore, there is no maximum dose no matter how many milligrams the patient is receiving. The appropriate dose is the dose needed to achieve pain relief. This is an important point for clinicians to explain to patients and families. Addiction or excessive respiratory depression is extremely unlikely in the terminally ill; fear of these side effects should neither prevent escalating opioid medications when the patient is experiencing insufficient pain relief nor justify using opioid antagonists.

Opioid side effects should be anticipated and treated preemptively. Nearly all patients experience constipation that can be debilitating (see below). Failure to prevent constipation often results in noncompliance with opioid therapy. Methylnaltrexone is a drug that targets opioid-induced constipation by blocking peripheral opioid receptors but not central receptors for analgesia. In placebo-controlled trials, it has been shown to cause laxation within 24 h of administration. As with the use of opioids, about a third of patients using methylnaltrexone experience nausea and vomiting, but unlike constipation, tolerance develops, usually within a week. Therefore, when one is beginning opioids, an antiemetic such as metoclopramide or a serotonin antagonist often is prescribed prophylactically and stopped after 1 week. Olanzapine also has been shown to have antinausea properties and can be effective in countering delirium or anxiety, with the advantage of some weight gain.

Drowsiness, a common side effect of opioids, also usually abates within a week. During this period, drowsiness can be treated with psychostimulants such as dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate, and modafinil. Modafinil has the advantage of everyday dosing. Pilot reports suggest that donepezil may also be helpful for opiate-induced drowsiness as well as relieving fatigue and anxiety. Metabolites of morphine and most opioids are cleared renally; doses may have to be adjusted for patients with renal failure.

Seriously ill patients who require chronic pain relief rarely if ever become addicted. Suspicion of addiction should not be a reason to withhold pain medications from terminally ill patients. Patients and families may withhold prescribed opioids for fear of addiction or dependence. Physicians and health care providers should reassure patients and families that the patient will not become addicted to opioids if they are used as prescribed for pain relief; this fear should not prevent the patient from taking the medications around the clock. However, diversion of drugs for use by other family members or illicit sale may occur. It may be necessary to advise the patient and caregiver about secure storage of opioids. Contract writing with the patient and family can help. If that fails, transfer to a safe facility may be necessary.

Tolerance is the need to increase medication dosage for the same pain relief without a change in disease. In the case of patients with advanced disease, the need for increasing opioid dosage for pain relief usually is caused by disease progression rather than tolerance. Physical dependence is indicated by symptoms from the abrupt withdrawal of opioids and should not be confused with addiction.

Adjuvant analgesic medications are nonopioids that potentiate the analgesic effects of opioids. They are especially important in the management of neuropathic pain. Gabapentin, an anticonvulsant initially studied in the setting of herpetic neuralgia, is now the first-line treatment for neuropathic pain from a variety of causes. It is begun at 100¨C300 mg bid or tid, with 50¨C100% dose increments every 3 days. Usually 900¨C3600 mg/d in two or three doses is effective. The combination of gabapentin and nortriptyline may be more effective than gabapentin alone. One potential side effect of gabapentin to be aware of is confusion and drowsiness, especially in the elderly. Other effective adjuvant medications include pregabalin, which has the same mechanism of action as gabapentin but is absorbed more efficiently from the GI tract. Lamotrigine is a novel agent whose mechanism of action is unknown, but it has shown effectiveness. It is recommended to begin at 25¨C50 mg/d, increasing to 100 mg/d. Carbamazepine, a first-generation agent, has been proved effective in randomized trials for neuropathic pain. Other potentially effective anticonvulsant adjuvants include topiramate (25¨C50 mg qd or bid, rising to 100¨C300 mg/d) and oxcarbazepine (75¨C300 mg bid, rising to 1200 mg bid). Glucocorticoids, preferably dexamethasone given once a day, can be useful in reducing inflammation that causes pain while elevating mood, energy, and appetite. Its main side effects include confusion, sleep difficulties, and fluid retention. Glucocorticoids are especially effective for bone pain and abdominal pain from distention of the GI tract or liver. Other drugs, including clonidine and baclofen, can be effective in pain relief. These drugs are adjuvants and generally should be used in conjunction with¡ªnot instead of¡ªopioids. Methadone, carefully dosed because of its unpredictable half-life in many patients, has activity at the N-methyl-d-aspartamate (NMDA) receptor and is useful for complex pain syndromes and neuropathic pain. It generally is reserved for cases in which first-line opioids (morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone) are either ineffective or unavailable.

Radiation therapy can treat bone pain from single metastatic lesions. Bone pain from multiple metastases can be amenable to radiopharmaceuticals such as strontium 89 and samarium 153. Bisphosphonates [such as pamidronate (90 mg every 4 weeks)] and calcitonin (200 IU intranasally once or twice a day) also provide relief from bone pain but have onset of action of days.

Constipation

Frequency

Constipation is reported in up to 87% of patients requiring palliative care.

Etiology

Although hypercalcemia and other factors can cause constipation, it is most frequently a predictable consequence of the use of opioids for the relief of pain and dyspnea and of tricyclic antidepressants, from their anticholinergic effects, as well as of the inactivity and poor diet that are common among seriously ill patients. If untreated, constipation can cause substantial pain and vomiting and also is associated with confusion and delirium. Whenever opioids and other medications known to cause constipation are used, preemptive treatment for constipation should be instituted.

Assessment

The physician should establish the patients previous bowel habits, including the frequency, consistency, and volume. Abdominal and rectal examinations should be performed to exclude impaction or acute abdomen. A number of constipation assessment scales are available, although guidelines issued in the Journal of Palliative Medicine did not recommend them for routine practice. Four commonly used assessment scales are the Bristol Stool Form Scale, the Constipation Assessment Scale, the Constipation Visual Analogue Scale, and the Eton Scale Risk Assessment for Constipation. Radiographic assessments beyond a simple flat plate of the abdomen in cases in which obstruction is suspected are rarely necessary.

Intervention

Intervention to reestablish comfortable bowel habits and relieve pain and discomfort should be the goals of any measures to address constipation during end-of-life care. Although physical activity, adequate hydration, and dietary treatments with fiber can be helpful, each is limited in its effectiveness for most seriously ill patients, and fiber may exacerbate problems in the setting of dehydration and if impaired motility is the etiology. Fiber is contraindicated in the presence of opioid use. Stimulant and osmotic laxatives, stool softeners, fluids, and enemas are the mainstays of therapy (Table 9-5). In preventing constipation from opioids and other medications, a combination of a laxative and a stool softener (such as senna and docusate) should be used. If after several days of treatment a bowel movement has not occurred, a rectal examination to remove impacted stool and place a suppository is necessary. For patients with impending bowel obstruction or gastric stasis, octreotide to reduce secretions can be helpful. For patients in whom the suspected mechanism is dysmotility, metoclopramide can be helpful.

Nausea

Frequency

Up to 70% of patients with advanced cancer have nausea, defined as the subjective sensation of wanting to vomit.

Etiology

Nausea and vomiting are both caused by stimulation at one of four sites: the GI tract, the vestibular system, the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), and the cerebral cortex. Medical treatments for nausea are aimed at receptors at each of these sites: The GI tract contains mechanoreceptors, chemoreceptors, and 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptors; the vestibular system probably contains histamine and acetylcholine receptors; and the CTZ contains chemoreceptors, dopamine type 2 receptors, and 5-HT3 receptors. An example of nausea that most likely is mediated by the cortex is anticipatory nausea before a dose of chemotherapy or other noxious stimuli.

Specific causes of nausea include metabolic changes (liver failure, uremia from renal failure, hypercalcemia), bowel obstruction, constipation, infection, GERD, vestibular disease, brain metastases, medications (including antibiotics, NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitors, opioids, and chemotherapy), and radiation therapy. Anxiety can also contribute to nausea.

Intervention

Medical treatment of nausea is directed at the anatomic and receptor-mediated cause that a careful history and physical examination reveals. When a single specific cause is not found, many advocate beginning treatment with a dopamine antagonist such as haloperidol or prochlorperazine. Prochlorperazine is usually more sedating than haloperidol. When decreased motility is suspected, metoclopramide can be an effective treatment. When inflammation of the GI tract is suspected, glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone are an appropriate treatment. For nausea that follows chemotherapy and radiation therapy, one of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron) is recommended. Clinicians should attempt prevention of postchemotherapy nausea rather than provide treatment after the fact. Current clinical guidelines recommend tailoring the strength of treatments to the specific emetic risk posed by a specific chemotherapy drug. When a vestibular cause (such as "motion sickness" or labyrinthitis) is suspected, antihistamines such as meclizine (whose primary side effect is drowsiness) or anticholinergics such as scopolamine can be effective. In anticipatory nausea, a benzodiazepine such as lorazepam is indicated. As with antihistamines, drowsiness and confusion are the main side effects.

Dyspnea

Frequency

Dyspnea is a subjective experience of being short of breath. Nearly 75% of dying patients experience dyspnea at some point in their illness. Dyspnea is among the most distressing physical symptoms and can be even more distressing than pain.

Assessment

As with pain, dyspnea is a subjective experience that may not correlate with objective measures of PO2, PCO2, or respiratory rate. Consequently, measurements of oxygen saturation through pulse oximetry or blood gases are rarely helpful in guiding therapy. Despite the limitations of existing assessment methods, physicians should regularly assess and document patients experience of dyspnea and its intensity. Guidelines recommend visual or analogue dyspnea scales to assess the severity of symptoms and the effects of treatment. Potentially reversible or treatable causes of dyspnea include infection, pleural effusions, pulmonary emboli, pulmonary edema, asthma, and tumor encroachment on the airway. However, the risk-versus-benefit ratio of the diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for patients with little time left to live must be considered carefully before one undertakes diagnostic steps. Frequently, the specific etiology cannot be identified, and dyspnea is the consequence of progression of the underlying disease that cannot be treated. The anxiety caused by dyspnea and the choking sensation can significantly exacerbate the underlying dyspnea in a negatively reinforcing cycle.

Interventions

When reversible or treatable etiologies are diagnosed, they should be treated as long as the side effects of treatment, such as repeated drainage of effusions or anticoagulants, are less burdensome than the dyspnea itself. More aggressive treatments such as stenting a bronchial lesion may be warranted if it is clear that the dyspnea is due to tumor invasion at that site and if the patient and family understand the risks of such a procedure. Usually, treatment will be symptomatic (Table 9-6). A dyspnea scale and careful monitoring should guide dose adjustment. Low-dose opioids reduce the sensitivity of the central respiratory center and the sensation of dyspnea. If patients are not receiving opioids, weak opioids can be initiated; if patients are already receiving opioids, morphine or other strong opioids should be used. Controlled trials do not support the use of nebulized opioids for dyspnea at the end of life. Phenothiazines and chlorpromazine may be helpful when combined with opioids. Benzodiazepines can be helpful if anxiety is present but should be neither used as first-line therapy nor used alone in the treatment of dyspnea. If the patient has a history of COPD or asthma, inhaled bronchodilators and glucocorticoids may be helpful. If the patient has pulmonary edema due to heart failure, diuresis with a medication such as furosemide is indicated. Excess secretions can be dried with scopolamine, transdermally or intravenously. Oxygen can be used, although it may only be an expensive placebo. For some families and patients, oxygen is distressing; for others, it is reassuring. More general interventions that medical staff can do include sitting the patient upright, removing smoke or other irritants such as perfume, ensuring a supply of fresh air with sufficient humidity, and minimizing other factors that can increase anxiety.

Fatigue

Frequency

More than 90% of terminally ill patients experience fatigue and/or weakness. Fatigue is one of the most commonly reported symptoms of cancer treatment as well as in the palliative care of multiple sclerosis, COPD, heart failure, and HIV. Fatigue frequently is cited as among the most distressing symptoms.

Etiology

The multiple causes of fatigue in the terminally ill can be categorized as resulting from the underlying disease; from disease-induced factors such as tumor necrosis factor and other cytokines; and from secondary factors such as dehydration, anemia, infection, hypothyroidism, and drug side effects. Apart from low caloric intake, loss of muscle mass and changes in muscle enzymes may play an important role in fatigue of terminal illness. The importance of changes in the CNS, especially the reticular activating system, have been hypothesized based on reports of fatigue in patients receiving cranial radiation, experiencing depression, or having chronic pain in the absence of cachexia or other physiologic changes. Finally, depression and other causes of psychological distress can contribute to fatigue.

Assessment

Fatigue is subjective; objective changes, even in body mass, may be absent. Consequently, assessment must rely on patient self-reporting. Scales used to measure fatigue, such as the Edmonton Functional Assessment Tool, the Fatigue Self-Report Scales, and the Rhoten Fatigue Scale, are usually appropriate for research rather than clinical purposes. In clinical practice, a simple performance assessment such as the Karnofsky Performance Status or the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Groups question "How much of the day does the patient spend in bed?" may be the best measure. In this 0¨C4 performance status assessment, 0 = normal activity; 1 = symptomatic without being bedridden; 2 = requiring some, but <50%, bed time; 3 = bedbound more than half the day; and 4 = bedbound all the time. Such a scale allows for assessment over time and correlates with overall disease severity and prognosis. A 2008 review by the European Association of Palliative Care also described several longer assessment tools with 9¨C20 items, including the Piper Fatigue Inventory, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, and the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI).

Interventions

At the end of life, fatigue will not be "cured." The goal is to ameliorate it and help patients and families adjust expectations. Behavioral interventions should be utilized to avoid blaming the patient for inactivity and to educate both the family and the patient that the underlying disease causes physiologic changes that produce low energy levels. Understanding that the problem is physiologic and not psychological can help alter expectations regarding the patients level of physical activity. Practically, this may mean reducing routine activities such as housework and cooking or social events outside the house and making it acceptable to receive guests lying on a couch. At the same time, institution of exercise regimens and physical therapy can raise endorphins, reduce muscle wasting, and reduce the risk of depression. In addition, ensuring good hydration without worsening edema may help reduce fatigue. Discontinuing medications that worsen fatigue may help, including cardiac medications, benzodiazepines, certain antidepressants, or opioids if pain is well-controlled. As end-of-life care proceeds into its final stages, fatigue may protect patients from further suffering, and continued treatment could be detrimental.

Only a few pharmacologic interventions target fatigue and weakness. Glucocorticoids can increase energy and enhance mood. Dexamethasone is preferred for its once-a-day dosing and minimal mineralocorticoid activity. Benefit, if any, usually is seen within the first month. Psychostimulants such as dextroamphetamine (5¨C10 mg PO) and methylphenidate (2.5¨C5 mg PO) may also enhance energy levels, although a randomized trial did not show methylphenidate beneficial compared with placebo in cancer fatigue. Doses should be given in the morning and at noon to minimize the risk of counterproductive insomnia. Modafinil, developed for narcolepsy, has shown some promise in the treatment of fatigue and has the advantage of once-daily dosing. Its precise role in fatigue at the end of life has not been determined. Anecdotal evidence suggests that l-carnitine may improve fatigue, depression, and sleep disruption.

Psychological Symptoms and Their Management

Depression

Frequency

Depression at the end of life presents an apparently paradoxical situation. Many people believe that depression is normal among seriously ill patients because they are dying. People frequently say, "Wouldnt you be depressed?" However, depression is not a necessary part of terminal illness and can contribute to needless suffering. Although sadness, anxiety, anger, and irritability are normal responses to a serious condition, they are typically of modest intensity and transient. Persistent sadness and anxiety and the physically disabling symptoms that they can lead to are abnormal and suggestive of major depression. Although as many as 75% of terminally ill patients experience depressive symptoms, <25% of terminally ill patients have major depression.

Etiology

Previous history of depression, family history of depression or bipolar disorder, and prior suicide attempts are associated with increased risk for depression among terminally ill patients. Other symptoms, such as pain and fatigue, are associated with higher rates of depression; uncontrolled pain can exacerbate depression, and depression can cause patients to be more distressed by pain. Many medications used in the terminal stages, including glucocorticoids, and some anticancer agents, such as tamoxifen, interleukin 2, interferon , and vincristine, also are associated with depression. Some terminal conditions, such as pancreatic cancer, certain strokes, and heart failure, have been reported to be associated with higher rates of depression, although this is controversial. Finally, depression may be attributable to grief over the loss of a role or function, social isolation, or loneliness.

Assessment

Diagnosing depression among seriously ill patients is complicated because many of the vegetative symptoms in the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) criteria for clinical depression¡ªinsomnia, anorexia and weight loss, fatigue, decreased libido, and difficulty concentrating¡ªare associated with the dying process itself. The assessment of depression in seriously ill patients therefore should focus on the dysphoric mood, helplessness, hopelessness, and lack of interest and enjoyment and concentration in normal activities. The single questions "How often do you feel downhearted and blue?" (more than a good bit of the time or similar responses) and "Do you feel depressed most of the time?" are appropriate for screening.

Certain conditions may be confused with depression. Endocrinopathies such as hypothyroidism and Cushings syndrome, electrolyte abnormalities such as hypercalcemia, and akathisia, especially from dopamine-blocking antiemetics such as metoclopramide and prochlorperazine, can mimic depression and should be excluded.

Interventions

Physicians must treat any physical symptom, such as pain, that may be causing or exacerbating depression. Fostering adaptation to the many losses that the patient is experiencing can also be helpful. Nonpharmacologic interventions, including group or individual psychological counseling, and behavioral therapies such as relaxation and imagery can be helpful, especially in combination with drug therapy.

Pharmacologic interventions remain the core of therapy. The same medications are used to treat depression in terminally ill as in non-terminally ill patients. Psychostimulants may be preferred for patients with a poor prognosis or for those with fatigue or opioid-induced somnolence. Psychostimulants are comparatively fast acting, working within a few days instead of the weeks required for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Dextroamphetamine or methylphenidate should be started at 2.5¨C5.0 mg in the morning and at noon, the same starting doses used for treating fatigue. The dose can be escalated up to 15 mg bid. Modafinil is started at 100 mg qd and can be increased to 200 mg if there is no effect at the lower dose. Pemoline is a nonamphetamine psychostimulant with minimal abuse potential. It is also effective as an antidepressant beginning at 18.75 mg in the morning and at noon. Because it can be absorbed through the buccal mucosa, it is preferred for patients with intestinal obstruction or dysphagia. If it is used for prolonged periods, liver function must be monitored. The psychostimulants can also be combined with more traditional antidepressants while waiting for the antidepressants to become effective and then tapered after a few weeks if necessary. Psychostimulants have side effects, particularly initial anxiety, insomnia, and rarely paranoia, which may necessitate lowering the dose or discontinuing treatment.

Mirtazapine, an antagonist at the postsynaptic serotonin receptors, is a promising psychostimulant. It should be started at 7.5 mg before bed. It has sedating, antiemetic, and anxiolytic properties with few drug interactions. Its side effect of weight gain may be beneficial for seriously ill patients; it is available in orally disintegrating tablets.

For patients with a prognosis of several months or longer, SSRIs, including fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine and citalopram, and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors such as venlafaxine, are the preferred treatment because of their efficacy and comparatively few side effects. Because low doses of these medications may be effective for seriously ill patients, one should use half the usual starting dose for healthy adults. The starting dose for fluoxetine is 10 mg once a day. In most cases, once-a-day dosing is possible. The choice of which SSRI to use should be driven by (1) the patients past success or failure with the specific medication and (2) the most favorable side-effect profile for that specific agent. For instance, for a patient in whom fatigue is a major symptom, a more activating SSRI (fluoxetine) would be appropriate. For a patient in whom anxiety and sleeplessness are major symptoms, a more sedating SSRI (paroxetine) would be appropriate.

Atypical antidepressants are recommended only in selected circumstances, usually with the assistance of a specialty consultation. Trazodone can be an effective antidepressant but is sedating and can cause orthostatic hypotension and, rarely, priapism. Therefore, it should be used only when a sedating effect is desired and is often used for patients with insomnia, at a dose starting at 25 mg. In addition to its antidepressant effects, bupropion is energizing, making it useful for depressed patients who experience fatigue. However, it can cause seizures, preventing its use for patients with a risk of CNS neoplasms or terminal delirium. Finally, alprazolam, a benzodiazepine, starting at 0.25¨C1.0 mg tid, can be effective in seriously ill patients who have a combination of anxiety and depression. Although it is potent and works quickly, it has many drug interactions and may cause delirium, especially among very ill patients, because of its strong binding to the benzodiazepine¨C-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complex.

Unless used as adjuvants for the treatment of pain, tricyclic antidepressants are not recommended. Similarly, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not recommended because of their side effects and dangerous drug interactions.

Delirium (see Chap. 25)

Frequency

In the weeks or months before death, delirium is uncommon, although it may be significantly underdiagnosed. However, delirium becomes relatively common in the hours and days immediately before death. Up to 85% of patients dying from cancer may experience terminal delirium.

Etiology

Delirium is a global cerebral dysfunction characterized by alterations in cognition and consciousness. It frequently is preceded by anxiety, changes in sleep patterns (especially reversal of day and night), and decreased attention. In contrast to dementia, delirium has an acute onset, is characterized by fluctuating consciousness and inattention, and is reversible, although reversibility may be more theoretical than real for patients near death. Delirium may occur in a patient with dementia; indeed, patients with dementia are more vulnerable to delirium.

Causes of delirium include metabolic encephalopathy arising from liver or renal failure, hypoxemia, or infection; electrolyte imbalances such as hypercalcemia; paraneoplastic syndromes; dehydration; and primary brain tumors, brain metastases, or leptomeningeal spread of tumor. Commonly, among dying patients, delirium can be caused by side effects of treatments, including radiation for brain metastases, and medications, including opioids, glucocorticoids, anticholinergic drugs, antihistamines, antiemetics, benzodiazepines, and chemotherapeutic agents. The etiology may be multifactorial; e.g., dehydration may exacerbate opioid-induced delirium.

Assessment

Delirium should be recognized in any terminally ill patient with new onset of disorientation, impaired cognition, somnolence, fluctuating levels of consciousness, or delusions with or without agitation. Delirium must be distinguished from acute anxiety and depression as well as dementia. The central distinguishing feature is altered consciousness, which usually is not noted in anxiety, depression, and dementia. Although "hyperactive" delirium characterized by overt confusion and agitation is probably more common, patients also should be assessed for "hypoactive" delirium characterized by sleep-wake reversal and decreased alertness.

In some cases, use of formal assessment tools such as the Mini-Mental Status Examination (which does not distinguish delirium from dementia) and the Delirium Rating Scale (which does distinguish delirium from dementia) may be helpful in distinguishing delirium from other processes. The patients list of medications must be evaluated carefully. Nonetheless, a reversible etiologic factor for delirium is found in fewer than half of terminally ill patients. Because most terminally ill patients experiencing delirium will be very close to death and may be at home, extensive diagnostic evaluations such as lumbar punctures and neuroradiologic examinations are usually inappropriate.

Interventions

One of the most important objectives of terminal care is to provide terminally ill patients the lucidity to say goodbye to the people they love. Delirium, especially with agitation during the final days, is distressing to family and caregivers. A strong determinant of bereavement difficulties is witnessing a difficult death. Thus, terminal delirium should be treated aggressively.

At the first sign of delirium, such as day-night reversal with slight changes in mentation, the physician should let the family members know that it is time to be sure that everything they want to say has been said. The family should be informed that delirium is common just before death.

If medications are suspected of being a cause of the delirium, unnecessary agents should be discontinued. Other potentially reversible causes, such as constipation, urinary retention, and metabolic abnormalities, should be treated. Supportive measures aimed at providing a familiar environment should be instituted, including restricting visits only to individuals with whom the patient is familiar and eliminating new experiences; orienting the patient, if possible, by providing a clock and calendar; and gently correcting the patients hallucinations or cognitive mistakes.

Pharmacologic management focuses on the use of neuroleptics and, in the extreme, anesthetics (Table 9-7). Haloperidol remains first-line therapy. Usually, patients can be controlled with a low dose (1¨C3 mg/d), usually given every 6 h, although some may require as much as 20 mg/d. It can be administered PO, SC, or IV. IM injections should not be used, except when this is the only way to get a patient under control. Olanzapine, an atypical neuroleptic, has shown significant effectiveness in completely resolving delirium in cancer patients. It has other beneficial effects for terminally ill patients, including antinausea, antianxiety, and weight gain. It is useful for patients with longer anticipated life expectancy because it is less likely to cause dysphoria and has a lower risk of dystonic reactions. Also, because it is metabolized through multiple pathways, it can be used in patients with hepatic and renal dysfunction. Olanzapine has the disadvantage that it is available only orally and that it takes a week to reach steady state. The usual dose is 2.5¨C5 mg PO bid. Chlorpromazine (10¨C25 mg every 4¨C6 h) can be useful if sedation is desired and can be administered IV or PR in addition to PO. Dystonic reactions resulting from dopamine blockade are a side effect of neuroleptics, although they are reported to be rare when these drugs are used to treat terminal delirium. If patients develop dystonic reactions, benztropine should be administered. Neuroleptics may be combined with lorazepam to reduce agitation when the delirium is the result of alcohol or sedative withdrawal.

If no response to first-line therapy is seen, a specialty consultation should be obtained with a change to a different medication. If patients fail to improve after a second neuroleptic, sedation with an anesthetic such as propofol or continuous-infusion midazolam may be necessary. By some estimates, at the very end of life as many as 25% of patients experiencing delirium, especially restless delirium with myoclonus or convulsions, may require sedation.

Physical restraints should be used with great reluctance only when the patients violence is threatening to self or others. If they are used, their appropriateness should be reevaluated frequently.

Insomnia

Frequency

Sleep disorders, defined as difficulty initiating sleep or maintaining sleep, sleep difficulty at least 3 nights a week, or sleep difficulty that causes impairment of daytime functioning, occurs in 19¨C63% of patients with advanced cancer. Some 30¨C74% of patients with other end-stage conditions, including AIDS, heart disease, COPD, and renal disease, experience insomnia.

Etiology

Patients with cancer may have changes in sleep efficiency such as an increase in stage I sleep. Other etiologies of insomnia are coexisting physical illness such as thyroid disease and coexisting psychological illnesses such as depression and anxiety. Medications, including antidepressants, psychostimulants, steroids, and  agonists, are significant contributors to sleep disorders, as are caffeine and alcohol. Multiple over-the-counter medications contain caffeine and antihistamines, which can contribute to sleep disorders.

Assessment

Assessment should include specific questions concerning sleep onset, sleep maintenance, and early-morning wakening as these will provide clues to the causative agents and to management. Patients should be asked about previous sleep problems, screened for depression and anxiety, and asked about symptoms of thyroid disease. Caffeine and alcohol are prominent causes of sleep problems, and a careful history of the use of these substances should be obtained. Both excessive use and withdrawal from alcohol can be causes of sleep problems.

Interventions

The mainstays of intervention include improvement of sleep hygiene (encouragement of regular time for sleep, decreased nighttime distractions, elimination of caffeine and other stimulants and alcohol), intervention to treat anxiety and depression, and treatment for the insomnia itself. For patients with depression who have insomnia and anxiety, a sedating antidepressant such as mirtazapine can be helpful. In the elderly, trazodone, beginning at 25 mg at nighttime, is an effective sleep aid at doses lower than those which cause its antidepressant effect. Zolpidem may have a decreased incidence of delirium in patients compared with traditional benzodiazepines, but this has not been clearly established. When benzodiazepines are prescribed, short-acting ones (such as lorazepam) are favored over longer-acting (such as diazepam). Patients who receive these medications should be observed for signs of increased confusion and delirium.

Social Needs and Their Management

Financial Burdens

Frequency

Dying can impose substantial economic strains on patients and families, causing distress. In the United States, with one of the least comprehensive health insurance systems among the developed countries, ~20% of terminally ill patients and their families spend >10% of family income on health care costs over and above health insurance premiums. Between 10 and 30% of families sell assets, use savings, or take out a mortgage to pay for the patients health care costs. Nearly 40% of terminally ill patients in the United States report that the cost of their illness is a moderate or great economic hardship for their family.

The patient is likely to reduce and eventually stop working. In 20% of cases, a family member of the terminally ill patient also stops working to provide care. The major underlying causes of economic burden are related to poor physical functioning and care needs, such as the need for housekeeping, nursing, and personal care. More debilitated patients and poor patients experience greater economic burdens.

Intervention

This economic burden should not be ignored as a private matter. It has been associated with a number of adverse health outcomes, including preferring comfort care over life-prolonging care as well as consideration of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. Economic burdens increase the psychological distress of families and caregivers of terminally ill patients, and poverty is associated with many adverse health outcomes. Importantly, recent studies found that "patients with advanced cancer who reported having end-of-life conversations with physicians had significantly lower health care costs in their final week of life. Higher costs were associated with worse quality of death." Assistance from a social worker, early on if possible, to ensure access to all available benefits may be helpful. Many patients, families, and health care providers are unaware of options for long-term care insurance, respite care, the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), and other sources of assistance. Some of these options (such as respite care) may be part of a formal hospice program but others (such as the FMLA) do not require enrollment in a hospice program.

Relationships

Frequency

Settling personal issues and closing the narrative of lived relationships are universal needs. When asked if sudden death or death after an illness is preferable, respondents often initially select the former but soon change to the latter as they reflect on the importance of saying goodbye. Bereaved family members who have not had the chance to say goodbye often have a more difficult grief process.

Interventions

Care of seriously ill patients requires efforts to facilitate the types of encounters and time spent with family and friends that are necessary to meet those needs. Family and close friends may need to be accommodated with unrestricted visiting hours, which may include sleeping near the patient even in otherwise regimented institutional settings. Physicians and other health care providers may be able to facilitate and resolve strained interactions between the patient and other family members. Assistance for patients and family members who are unsure about how to create or help preserve memories, whether by providing materials such as a scrapbook or memory box or by offering them suggestions and informational resources, can be deeply appreciated. Taking photographs and creating videos can be especially helpful to terminally ill patients who have younger children or grandchildren.

Family Caregivers

Frequency

Caring for seriously ill patients places a heavy burden on families. Families frequently are required to provide transportation and homemaking as well as other services. Typically, paid professionals such as home health nurses and hospice workers supplement family care; only about a quarter of all caregiving consists of exclusively paid professional assistance. The trend toward more out-of-hospital deaths will increase reliance on families for end-of-life care. Increasingly, family members are being called upon to provide physical care (such as moving and bathing patients) and medical care (such as assessing symptoms and giving medications) in addition to emotional care and support.

Three-quarters of family caregivers of terminally ill patients are women¡ªwives, daughters, sisters, and even daughters-in-law. Since many are widowed, women tend to be able to rely less on family for caregiving assistance and may need more paid assistance. About 20% of terminally ill patients report substantial unmet needs for nursing and personal care. The impact of caregiving on family caregivers is substantial: both bereaved and current caregivers have a higher mortality rate than that of non-caregiving controls.

Interventions

It is imperative to inquire about unmet needs and to try to ensure that those needs are met either through the family or by paid professional services when possible. Community assistance through houses of worship or other community groups often can be mobilized by telephone calls from the medical team to someone the patient or family identifies. Sources of support specifically for family caregivers should be identified through local sources or nationally through groups such as the National Family Caregivers Association (www.nfcacares.org), the American Cancer Society (www.cancer.org), and the Alzheimers Association (www.alz.org).

Existential Needs and Their Management

Frequency

Religion and spirituality are often important to dying patients. Nearly 70% of patients report becoming more religious or spiritual when they became terminally ill, and many find comfort in religious or spiritual practices such as prayer. However, ~20% of terminally ill patients become less religious, frequently feeling cheated or betrayed by becoming terminally ill. For other patients, the need is for existential meaning and purpose that is distinct from and may even be antithetical to religion or spirituality. When asked, patients and family caregivers frequently report wanting their professional caregivers to be more attentive to religion and spirituality.

Assessment

Health care providers are often hesitant about involving themselves in the religious, spiritual, and existential experiences of their patients because it may seem private or not relevant to the current illness. But physicians and other members of the care team should be able at least to detect spiritual and existential needs. Screening questions have been developed for a physicians spiritual history taking. Spiritual distress can amplify other types of suffering and even masquerade as intractable physical pain, anxiety, or depression. The screening questions in the comprehensive assessment are usually sufficient. Deeper evaluation and intervention are rarely appropriate for the physician unless no other member of a care team is available or suitable. Pastoral care providers may be helpful, whether from the medical institution or from the patients own community.

Interventions

Precisely how religious practices, spirituality, and existential explorations can be facilitated and improve end-of-life care is not well established. What is clear is that for physicians, one main intervention is to inquire about the role and importance of spirituality and religion in a patients life. This will help a patient feel heard and help physicians identify specific needs. In one study, only 36% of respondents indicated that a clergy member would be comforting. Nevertheless, the increase in religious and spiritual interest among a substantial fraction of dying patients suggests inquiring of individual patients how this need can be addressed. Some evidence supports specific methods of addressing existential needs in patients, ranging from establishing a supportive group environment for terminal patients to individual treatments emphasizing a patients dignity and sources of meaning.
 
Managing the Last Stages

Withdrawing and Withholding Life-Sustaining Treatment


Legal Aspects

For centuries, it has been deemed ethical to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining interventions. The current legal consensus in the United States and most developed countries is that patients have a moral as well as constitutional or common law right to refuse medical interventions. American courts also have held that incompetent patients have a right to refuse medical interventions. For patients who are incompetent and terminally ill and who have not completed an advance care directive, next of kin can exercise that right, although this may be restricted in some states, depending how clear and convincing the evidence is of the patients preferences. Courts have limited families ability to terminate life-sustaining treatments in patients who are conscious, incompetent, but not terminally ill. In theory, patients right to refuse medical therapy can be limited by four countervailing interests: (1) preservation of life, (2) prevention of suicide, (3) protection of third parties such as children, and (4) preservation of the integrity of the medical profession. In practice, these interests almost never override the right of competent patients and incompetent patients who have left explicit and advance care directives.

For incompetent patients who either appointed a proxy without specific indications of their wishes or never completed an advance care directive, three criteria have been suggested to guide the decision to terminate medical interventions. First, some commentators suggest that ordinary care should be administered but extraordinary care could be terminated. Because the ordinary/extraordinary distinction is too vague, courts and commentators widely agree that it should not be used to justify decisions about stopping treatment. Second, many courts have advocated the use of the substituted-judgment criterion, which holds that the proxy decision-makers should try to imagine what the incompetent patient would do if he or she were competent. However, multiple studies indicate that many proxies, even close family members, cannot accurately predict what the patient would have wanted. Therefore, substituted judgment becomes more of a guessing game than a way of fulfilling the patients wishes. Finally, the best-interests criterion holds that proxies should evaluate treatments by balancing their benefits and risks and select those treatments in which the benefits maximally outweigh the burdens of treatment. Clinicians have a clear and crucial role in this by carefully and dispassionately explaining the known benefits and burdens of specific treatments. Yet even when that information is as clear as possible, different individuals can have very different views of what is in the patients best interests, and families may have disagreements or even overt conflicts. This criterion has been criticized because there is no single way to determine the balance between benefits and burdens; it depends on a patients personal values. For instance, for some people being alive even if mentally incapacitated is a benefit, whereas for others it may be the worst possible existence. As a matter of practice, physicians rely on family members to make decisions that they feel are best and object only if those decisions seem to demand treatments that the physicians consider not beneficial.

Practices

Withholding and withdrawing acutely life-sustaining medical interventions from terminally ill patients are now standard practice. More than 90% of American patients die without cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and just as many forgo other potentially life-sustaining interventions. For instance, in ICUs in the period 1987¨C1988, CPR was performed 49% of the time, but it was performed only 10% of the time in 1992¨C1993. On average, 3.8 interventions, such as vasopressors and transfusions, were stopped for each dying ICU patient. However, up to 19% of decedents in hospitals received interventions such as extubation, ventilation, and surgery in the 48 h preceding death. However, practices vary widely among hospitals and ICUs, suggesting an important element of physician preferences rather than objective data.

Mechanical ventilation may be the most challenging intervention to withdraw. The two approaches are terminal extubation, which is the removal of the endotracheal tube, and terminal weaning, which is the gradual reduction of the FiO2 or ventilator rate. One-third of ICU physicians prefer to use the terminal weaning technique, and 13% extubate; the majority of physicians utilize both techniques. The American Thoracic Societys 2008 clinical policy guidelines note that there is no single correct process of ventilator withdrawal and that physicians use and should be proficient in both methods but that the chosen approach should carefully balance benefits and burdens as well as patient and caregiver preferences. Physicians assessment of patients likelihood of survival, their prediction of possible cognitive damage, and patients preferences about the use of life support are primary factors in determining the likelihood of withdrawal of mechanical ventilation. Some recommend terminal weaning because patients do not develop upper airway obstruction and the distress caused by secretions or stridor; however, terminal weaning can prolong the dying process and not allow a patients family to be with him or her unencumbered by an endotracheal tube. To ensure comfort for conscious or semiconscious patients before withdrawal of the ventilator, neuromuscular blocking agents should be terminated and sedatives and analgesics administered. Removing the neuromuscular blocking agents permits patients to show discomfort, facilitating the titration of sedatives and analgesics; it also permits interactions between patients and their families. A common practice is to inject a bolus of midazolam (2¨C4 mg) or lorazepam (2¨C4 mg) before withdrawal, followed by 5¨C10 mg of morphine and continuous infusion of morphine (50% of the bolus dose per hour) during weaning. In patients who have significant upper airway secretions, IV scopolamine at a rate of 100 g/h can be administered. Additional boluses of morphine or increases in the infusion rate should be administered for respiratory distress or signs of pain. Higher doses will be needed for patients already receiving sedatives and opioids. Families need to be reassured about treatments for common symptoms after withdrawal of ventilatory support, such as dyspnea and agitation, and warned about the uncertainty of length of survival after withdrawal of ventilatory support: up to 10% of patients unexpectedly survive for 1 day or more after mechanical ventilation is stopped.

Futile Care

Beginning in the late 1980s, some commentators argued that physicians could terminate futile treatments demanded by the families of terminally ill patients. Although no objective definition or standard of futility exists, several categories have been proposed. Physiologic futility means that an intervention will have no physiologic effect. Some have defined qualitative futility as applying to procedures that "fail to end a patients total dependence on intensive medical care." Quantitative futility occurs "when physicians conclude (through personal experience, experiences shared with colleagues, or consideration of reported empiric data) that in the last 100 cases, a medical treatment has been useless." The term conceals subjective value judgments about when a treatment is "not beneficial." Deciding whether a treatment that obtains an additional 6 weeks of life or a 1% survival advantage confers benefit depends on patients preferences and goals. Furthermore, physicians predictions of when treatments were futile deviated markedly from the quantitative definition. When residents thought CPR was quantitatively futile, more than one in five patients had a >10% chance of survival to hospital discharge. Most studies that purport to guide determinations of futility are based on insufficient data to provide statistical confidence for clinical decision-making. Quantitative futility rarely applies in ICU settings. Many commentators reject using futility as a criterion for withdrawing care, preferring instead to consider futility situations as ones that represent conflict that calls for careful negotiation between families and health care providers.

In the wake of a lack of consensus over quantitative measures of futility, many hospitals adopted process-based approaches to resolve disputes over futility and enhance communication with patients and surrogates, including focusing on interests and alternatives rather than opposing positions and generating a wide range of options. Some hospitals have enacted "unilateral DNR" policies to allow clinicians to provide a do-not-resuscitate order in cases in which consensus cannot be reached with families and medical opinion is that resuscitation would be futile if attempted. This type of a policy is not a replacement for careful and patient communication and negotiation but recognizes that agreement cannot always be reached. Over the last 15 years, many states, such as Texas, Virginia, Maryland, and California, have enacted so-called medical futility laws that provide physicians a "safe harbor" from liability if they refuse a patient or familys request for life-sustaining interventions. For instance, in Texas when a disagreement about terminating interventions between the medical team and the family has not been resolved by an ethics consultation, the hospital is supposed to try to facilitate transfer of the patient to an institution willing to provide treatment. If this fails after 10 days, the hospital and physician may unilaterally withdraw treatments determined to be futile. The family may appeal to a state court. Early data suggest that the law increases futility consultations for the ethics committee and that although most families concur with withdrawal, about 10¨C15% of families refuse to withdraw treatment. Approximately 12 cases have gone to court in Texas in the 7 years since the adoption of the law. As of 2007, there had been 974 ethics committee consultations on medical futility cases and 65 in which committees ruled against families and gave notice that treatment would be terminated. Treatment was withdrawn for 27 of those patients, and the remainder transferred to other facilities or died while awaiting transfer.

Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide

Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are defined in Table 9-8. Terminating life-sustaining care and providing opioid medications to manage symptoms have long been considered ethical by the medical profession and legal by courts and should not be confused with euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide.

Netherlands 

Belgium

Legal Aspects

Euthanasia is legal in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. It was legalized in the Northern Territory of Australia in 1995, but that legislation was repealed in 1997. Euthanasia is not legal in any state in the United States. With certain conditions, in Switzerland, a layperson can legally assist suicide. In the United States, physician-assisted suicide is legal in Oregon and Washington State if multiple criteria are met and then only after a process that includes a 15-day waiting period. In 2009, the state supreme court of Montana ruled that state law permits physician-assisted suicide for terminally ill patients. In all other countries and all other states in the United States, physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia are illegal explicitly or by common law.

Practices

Fewer than 10¨C20% of terminally ill patients actually consider euthanasia and/or physician-assisted suicide for themselves. In the Netherlands and Oregon, >70% of patients utilizing these interventions are dying of cancer; <10% of deaths by euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide involve patients with AIDS or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In the Netherlands, the share of deaths attributable to euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide declined from around 2.8% of all deaths in 2001 to around 1.8% in 2005. In 2009, the last year with complete data, around 60 patients in Oregon (~0.2% of all deaths) died by physician-assisted suicide, although this may be an underestimate. In Washington State, between March 2009 (when the law allowing physician-assisted suicide went into force) and December 2009, 36 individuals died from prescribed lethal doses.

Pain is not a primary motivator for patients requests for or interest in euthanasia and/or physician-assisted suicide. Among the first patients to receive physician-assisted suicide in Oregon, only 1 patient of 15 had inadequate pain control compared with 15 of 43 patients in a control group experiencing inadequate pain relief. Depression, hopelessness, and, more profoundly, concerns about loss of dignity or autonomy or being a burden on family members appear to be primary factors motivating a desire for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. In Oregon, fewer than 25% of patients cite pain as the reason for desiring physician-assisted suicide. Most cite losing autonomy, dignity, or enjoyable activities. Over a third note being a burden on family. A study from the Netherlands showed that depressed terminally ill cancer patients were four times more likely to request euthanasia and confirmed that uncontrolled pain was not associated with greater interest in euthanasia.

Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are no guarantee of a painless, quick death. Data from the Netherlands indicate that in as many as 20% of cases technical and other problems arose, including patients waking from coma, not becoming comatose, regurgitating medications, and experiencing a prolonged time to death. Data from Oregon indicate that between 1997 and 2009, 20 patients (around 5%) regurgitated after taking prescribed medication, 1 patient awaked, and none experienced seizures. Problems were significantly more common in physician-assisted suicide, sometimes requiring the physician to intervene and provide euthanasia.

Whether practicing in a setting where euthanasia is legal or not, over a career, 12¨C54% of physicians receive a request for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide from a patient. Competency in dealing with such a request is crucial. Although challenging, the request can also provide a chance to address intense suffering. After receiving a request for euthanasia and/or physician-assisted suicide, health care providers should carefully clarify the request with empathic, open-ended questions to help elucidate the underlying cause for the request, such as: "What makes you want to consider this option?" Endorsing either moral opposition or moral support for the act tends to be counterproductive, giving an impression of being judgmental or of endorsing the idea that the patients life is worthless. Health care providers must reassure the patient of continued care and commitment. The patient should be educated about alternative, less controversial options, such as symptom management and withdrawing any unwanted treatments and the reality of euthanasia and/or physician-assisted suicide, since the patient may have misconceptions about their effectiveness as well as the legal implications of the choice. Depression, hopelessness, and other symptoms of psychological distress as well as physical suffering and economic burdens are likely factors motivating the request, and such factors should be assessed and treated aggressively. After these interventions and clarification of options, most patients proceed with another approach, declining life-sustaining interventions, possibly including refusal of nutrition and hydration.

Care during the Last Hours

Most laypersons have limited experiences with the actual dying process and death. They frequently do not know what to expect of the final hours and afterward. The family and other caregivers must be prepared, especially if the plan is for the patient to die at home.

Patients in the last days of life typically experience extreme weakness and fatigue and become bedbound; this can lead to pressure sores. The issue of turning patients who are near the end of life, however, must be balanced against the potential discomfort that movement may cause. Patients stop eating and drinking with drying of mucosal membranes and dysphagia. Careful attention to oral swabbing, lubricants for lips, and use of artificial tears can provide a form of care to substitute for attempts at feeding the patient. With loss of the gag reflex and dysphagia, patients may also experience accumulation of oral secretions, producing noises during respiration sometimes called "the death rattle." Scopolamine can reduce the secretions. Patients also experience changes in respiration with periods of apnea or Cheyne-Stokes breathing. Decreased intravascular volume and cardiac output cause tachycardia, hypotension, peripheral coolness, and livedo reticularis (skin mottling). Patients can have urinary and, less frequently, fecal incontinence. Changes in consciousness and neurologic function generally lead to two different paths to death (Fig. 9-2).

Each of these terminal changes can cause patients and families distress, requiring reassurance and targeted interventions (Table 9-9). Informing families that these changes might occur and providing them with an information sheet can help preempt problems and minimize distress. Understanding that patients stop eating because they are dying, not dying because they have stopped eating, can reduce family and caregiver anxiety. Similarly, informing the family and caregivers that the "death rattle" may occur and that it is not indicative of suffocation, choking, or pain can reduce their worry from the breathing sounds.

Table 9-9 Managing Changes in the Patient's Condition during the Final Days and Hours

 
 
Changes in the Patient's Condition Potential Complication Family's Possible Reaction and Concern Advice and Intervention 
Profound fatigue Bedbound with development of pressure ulcers that are prone to infection, malodor, and pain, and joint pain Patient is lazy and giving up. Reassure family and caregivers that terminal fatigue will not respond to interventions and should not be resisted. 

Use an air mattress if necessary.
 
Anorexia None Patient is giving up; patient will suffer from hunger and will starve to death. Reassure family and caregivers that the patient is not eating because he or she is dying; not eating at the end of life does not cause suffering or death.

Forced feeding, whether oral, parenteral, or enteral, does not reduce symptoms or prolong life.
 
Dehydration Dry mucosal membranes (see below) Patient will suffer from thirst and die of dehydration. Reassure family and caregivers that dehydration at the end of life does not cause suffering because patients lose consciousness before any symptom distress. 

Intravenous hydration can worsen symptoms of dyspnea by pulmonary edema and peripheral edema as well as prolong dying process.
 
Dysphagia Inability to swallow oral medications needed for palliative care   Do not force oral intake. 

Discontinue unnecessary medications that may have been continued, including antibiotics, diuretics, antidepressants, and laxatives. 

If swallowing pills is difficult, convert essential medications (analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics, and psychotropics) to oral solutions, buccal, sublingual, or rectal administration.
 
"Death rattle"¡ªnoisy breathing   Patient is choking and suffocating. Reassure the family and caregivers that this is caused by secretions in the oropharynx and the patient is not choking. 

Reduce secretions with scopolamine (0.2¨C0.4 mg SC q4h or 1¨C3 patches q3d). 

Reposition patient to permit drainage of secretions. 

Do not suction. Suction can cause patient and family discomfort and is usually ineffective.
 
Apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respirations, dyspnea   Patient is suffocating. Reassure family and caregivers that unconscious patients do not experience suffocation or air hunger. 

Apneic episodes are frequently a premorbid change. 

Opioids or anxiolytics may be used for dyspnea. 

Oxygen is unlikely to relieve dyspneic symptoms and may prolong the dying process.
 
Urinary or fecal incontinence Skin breakdown if days until death 

Potential transmission of infectious agents to caregivers
 Patient is dirty, malodorous, and physically repellent. Remind family and caregivers to use universal precautions. 

Frequent changes of bedclothes and bedding. 

Use diapers, urinary catheter, or rectal tube if diarrhea or high urine output.
 
Agitation or delirium Day/night reversal 

Hurt self or caregivers
 Patient is in horrible pain and going to have a horrible death. Reassure family and caregivers that agitation and delirium do not necessarily connote physical pain. 

Depending on the prognosis and goals of treatment, consider evaluating for causes of delirium and modify medications. 

Manage symptoms with haloperidol, chlorpromazine, diazepam, or midazolam.
 
Dry mucosal membranes Cracked lips, mouth sores, and candidiasis can also cause pain. 

Odor
 Patient may be malodorous, physically repellent. Use baking soda mouthwash or saliva preparation q15¨C30min. 

Use topical nystatin for candidiasis. 

Coat lips and nasal mucosa with petroleum jelly q60¨C90min. 

Use ophthalmic lubricants q4h or artificial tears q30min.
 
 

 

Families and caregivers may also feel guilty about stopping treatments, fearing that they are "killing" the patient. This may lead to demands for interventions, such as feeding tubes, that may be ineffective. In such cases, the physician should remind the family and caregivers about the inevitability of events and the palliative goals. Interventions may prolong the dying process and cause discomfort. Physicians also should emphasize that withholding treatments is both legal and ethical and that the family members are not the cause of the patients death. This reassurance may have to be provided multiple times.

Hearing and touch are said to be the last senses to stop functioning. Whether this is the case or not, families and caregivers can be encouraged to communicate with the dying patient. Encouraging them to talk directly to the patient, even if he or she is unconscious, and hold the patients hand or demonstrate affection in other ways can be an effective way to channel their urge "to do something" for the patient.

When the plan is for the patient to die at home, the physician must inform the family and caregivers how to determine that the patient has died. The cardinal signs are cessation of cardiac function and respiration; the pupils become fixed; the body becomes cool; muscles relax; and incontinence may occur. Remind the family and caregivers that the eyes may remain open even after the patient has died because the retroorbital fat pad may be depleted, permitting the orbit to fall posteriorly, which makes it difficult for the eyelids to cover the eyeball.

The physician should establish a plan for who the family or caregivers will contact when the patient is dying or has died. Without a plan, they may panic and call 911, unleashing a cascade of unwanted events, from arrival of emergency personnel and resuscitation to hospital admission. The family and caregivers should be instructed to contact the hospice (if one is involved), the covering physician, or the on-call member of the palliative care team. They should also be told that the medical examiner need not be called unless the state requires it for all deaths. Unless foul play is suspected, the health care team need not contact the medical examiner either.

Just after the patient dies, even the best-prepared family may experience shock and loss and be emotionally distraught. They need time to assimilate the event and be comforted. Health care providers are likely to find it meaningful to write a bereavement card or letter to the family. The purpose is to communicate about the patient, perhaps emphasizing the patients virtues and the honor it was to care for the patient, and to express concern for the familys hardship. Some physicians attend the funerals of their patients. Although this is beyond any medical obligation, the presence of the physician can be a source of support to the grieving family and provides an opportunity for closure for the physician.

Death of a spouse is a strong predictor of poor health, and even mortality, for the surviving spouse. It may be important to alert the spouses physician about the death so that he or she is aware of symptoms that might require professional attention.
 
Palliative Care Services: How and Where

Determining the best approach to providing palliative care to patients will depend on patient preferences, the availability of caregivers and specialized services in close proximity, institutional resources, and reimbursement. Hospice is a leading, but not the only, model of palliative care services. In the United States, a plurality¡ª40.7%¡ªof hospice care is provided in residential homes. In 2008, just over 20% of hospice care was provided in nursing homes. In the United States, Medicare pays for hospice services under Part A, the hospital insurance part of reimbursement. Two physicians must certify that the patient has a prognosis of 6 months if the disease runs its usual course. Prognoses are probabilistic by their nature; patients are not required to die within 6 months but rather to have a condition from which half the individuals with it would not be alive within 6 months. Patients sign a hospice enrollment form that states their intent to forgo curative services related to their terminal illness, but they can still receive medical services for other comorbid conditions. Patients also can withdraw enrollment and reenroll later; the hospice Medicare benefit can be revoked later to secure traditional Medicare benefits. Payments to the hospice are per diem (or capitated), not fee-for-service. Payments are intended to cover physician services for the medical direction of the care team; regular home care visits by registered nurses and licensed practical nurses; home health aid and homemaker services; chaplain services; social work services; bereavement counseling; and medical equipment, supplies, and medications. No specific therapy is excluded, and the goal is for each therapy to be considered for its symptomatic (as opposed to disease-modifying) effect. Additional clinical care, including services of the primary physician, is covered by Medicare Part B even while the hospice Medicare benefit is in place. The health reform legislation signed into law in March 2010¡ªthe Affordable Care Act¡ªdirects the Secretary of Health and Human Services to gather data on Medicare hospice reimbursement with the goal of reforming payment rates to account for resource use over an entire episode of care. The legislation also requires additional evaluations and reviews of eligibility for hospice care by hospice physicians or nurses. Finally, the legislation establishes a demonstration project for concurrent hospice care in Medicare, which would test and evaluate allowing patients to remain eligible for regular Medicare during hospice care.

By 2008, the mean length of enrollment in a hospice was around 70 days, with the median being 21 days. Such short stays create barriers to establishing high-quality palliative services in patients homes and also place financial strains on hospice providers since the initial assessments are resource intensive. Physicians should initiate early referrals to the hospice to allow more time for patients to receive palliative care.

Hospice care has been the main method for securing palliative services for terminally ill patients. However, efforts are being made to ensure continuity of palliative care across settings and through time. Palliative care services are becoming available as consultative services and more rarely as palliative care units in hospitals, in day care and other outpatient settings, and in nursing homes. Palliative care consultations for nonhospice patients can be billed as for other consultations under Medicare Part B, the physician reimbursement part. Many believe palliative care should be offered to patients regardless of their prognosis. A patient, his or her family, and physicians should not have to make a "curative vs. palliative care" decision because it is rarely possible to make such a decisive switch to embracing mortality.
 
Future Directions

Outcome Measures

Care near the end of life cannot be measured by most of the available validated outcome measures since palliative care does not consider death a bad outcome. Similarly, the family and patients receiving end-of-life care may not desire the elements elicited in current quality-of-life measurements. Symptom control, enhanced family relationships, and quality of bereavement are difficult to measure and are rarely the primary focus of carefully developed or widely used outcome measures. Nevertheless, outcomes are as important in end-of-life care as in any other field of medical care. Specific end-of-life care instruments are being developed both for assessment, such as The Brief Hospice Inventory and NEST (needs near the end of life screening tool), and for outcome measures, such as the Palliative Care Outcomes Scale, as well as for prognosis, such as the Palliative Prognostic Index. The field of end-of-life care is entering an era of evidence-based practice and continuous improvement through clinical trials.

The Safety and Quality of Health Care: Introduction

The safety and quality of care are two of the central dimensions of health care. It is increasingly clear that both could be much better, and in recent years it has become easier to measure safety and quality. In addition, the public is¡ªwith good justification¡ªdemanding measurement and accountability, and payment for services increasingly will be based on performance in these areas. Thus, physicians must learn about these two domains, how they can be improved, and the relative strengths and limitations of the current ability to measure them.

Safety and quality are closely related but do not completely overlap. The Institute of Medicine has suggested in a seminal series of reports that safety is the first part of quality and that health care first must guarantee that it will deliver safe care, although quality is also pivotal. In the end, it is likely that more net clinical benefit will be derived from improving quality than from improving safety, though both are important and safety is in many ways more tangible to the public. Accordingly, the first section of this chapter will address issues relating to the safety of care and the second will cover quality of care.

Safety in Health Care

Safety Theory

Safety theory clearly points out that individuals make errors all the time. Think of driving home from the hospital; you intend to stop and pick up a quart of milk on the way home but find yourself entering your driveway without realizing how you got there. Everybody uses low-level, semiautomatic behavior for many activities in daily life; this kind of error is called a "slip." Slips occur often during care delivery, e.g., when people intend to write an order but forget because they have to complete another action first. "Mistakes," by contrast, are errors of a higher level; they occur in new or nonstereotypic situations in which conscious decisions are being made. An example would be dosing a medication with which a physician is not familiar. The strategies used to prevent slips and mistakes are often different.

Systems theory suggests that most accidents occur as the result of a series of small failures that happen to line up in an individual instance so that an accident can occur (Fig. 10-1). It also suggests that most individuals in an industry such as health care are trying to do the right thing (e.g., deliver safe care), and most accidents thus can be seen as resulting from defects in the systems. Correspondingly, systems should be designed both to make errors less likely and to identify those which do occur, as some inevitably will.

Figure 10-1

 
 
 
"Swiss cheese" diagram. Reason has argued that most accidents occur when a series of "latent failures" in a system are present and happen to line up in a given instance, resulting in an accident. Examples of latent failures in the case of a fall might be that the unit was unusually busy that day and that the floor happened to be wet. (Adapted from J Reason: Human error: Models and management. BMJ 320:768¨C770, 2000; with permission.)
 
 

Factors that Increase the Likelihood of Errors

Many factors ubiquitous in health care systems can increase the likelihood of errors, including fatigue, stress, interruptions, complexity, and transitions. The effects of fatigue in other industries are clear, but its effects in health care have been more controversial until recently. For example, the accident rate in truck drivers increases dramatically if they work over a certain number of hours in a week, especially with prolonged shifts. A recent study of house officers in the intensive care unit demonstrated that they were about one-third more likely to make errors when they were on a 24-h shift than when they were on a schedule that allowed them to sleep 8 h the previous night. The American College of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has moved to address this issue by putting in place the 80-h workweek. Although this is a step forward, it does not address the most important cause of fatigue-related errors: extended-duty shifts. High levels of stress and workload also can increase error rates. Thus, in extremely high-pressure situations, such as cardiac arrests, errors are more likely to occur. Strategies such as using protocols in these settings can be helpful, as can simply recognizing that the situation is stressful.

Interruptions also increase the likelihood of error and occur frequently in health care delivery. It is common to forget to complete an action when one is interrupted partway through it by a page, for example. Approaches that may be helpful in this area include minimizing the use of interruptions and setting up tools that help define the urgency of an interruption.

In addition, complexity represents a key issue that contributes to errors. Providers are confronted by streams of data, such as laboratory tests and vital signs, many of which provide little useful information but some of which are important and require action or suggest a specific diagnosis. Tools that emphasize specific abnormalities or combinations of abnormalities may be helpful in this area.

Transitions between providers and settings are also common in health care, especially with the advent of the 80-h workweek, and generally represent vulnerabilities. Tools that provide structure in exchanging information, e.g., when transferring care between providers, may be helpful.

The Frequency of Adverse Events in Health Care

Most large studies focusing on the frequency and consequences of adverse events have been performed in the inpatient setting; some data are available for nursing homes, and much less information is available about the outpatient setting. The Harvard Medical Practice Study, one of the largest studies to address this issue, was performed with hospitalized patients in New York. The primary outcome was the adverse event, which is an injury caused by medical management rather than the patients underlying disease. In this study, an event either resulted in death or disability at discharge or prolonged the length of stay by at least 2 days. Key findings were that the adverse event rate was 3.7%, and 58% of the adverse events were considered preventable. Although New York is not representative of the rest of the country, the study was replicated later in Colorado and Utah, where the rates were essentially similar. Since then, other studies have been performed in a variety of developed nations using analogous methodologies, and the rates in developed countries appear to be ~10%. The World Health Organization has focused on this area, forming the World Alliance for Patient Safety, and rates of safety issues in developing and transitional countries appear to be even higher; thus, this is clearly an issue of global proportions.

In the Medical Practice Study, adverse drug events (ADEs) were the most common type, accounting for 19% of adverse events, followed by wound infections (14%) and technical complications (13%). Almost half the adverse events were associated with a surgical procedure. Among nonoperative events, 37% were ADEs, 15% were diagnostic mishaps, 14% were therapeutic mishaps, 13% were procedure-related, and 5% were falls.

ADEs have been studied more than any other category. Studies focusing specifically on ADEs have found that they appear to be much more common than was suggested by the Medical Practice Study, although most other studies use more inclusive criteria. Detection approaches in the research setting include chart review and the use of a computerized ADE monitor, a tool that explores the database and identifies signals that suggest an ADE may have occurred. Studies that use multiple approaches find more ADEs than does any individual approach, suggesting that the true underlying rate in the population is higher than would be identified by an individual approach. About 6¨C10% of patients admitted to U.S. hospitals experience an ADE.

Injuries caused by drugs are also common in the outpatient setting. One study found a rate of 21 ADEs per every 100 patients per year when patients were called to assess whether they had had a problem with one of their medications. The severity level was lower than in the inpatient setting, but approximately one-third of these ADEs were preventable.

Another area that appears to be very risky is the period immediately after a patient is discharged from the hospital. A recent study of patients hospitalized on a medical service found an adverse event rate of 19%; about a third of those events were preventable, and another third were ameliorable in that they could have been made less severe. ADEs were the single leading category.

Prevention Strategies

Most of the work on prevention strategies for adverse events has targeted specific types of adverse events in the inpatient setting, with nosocomial infections and ADEs having received the most attention. Nosocomial infection rates have been reduced greatly in intensive care settings, especially through the use of checklists. For ADEs, several strategies have been found to reduce the medication error rate, although it has been harder to demonstrate that they reduce the ADE rate, and studies with adequate power to demonstrate a clinically meaningful reduction have not been published.

Implementation of checklists to ensure that specific actions are carried out has had a major impact on rates of catheter-associated bloodstream infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia, two of the most serious complications occurring in intensive care. The concept is that there are several specific actions that can reduce the frequency of these issues; when these actions are all carried out for every patient, the result has been an extreme reduction in the frequency of the associated complication. Furthermore, these practices have been disseminated across wide areas, in particular in the state of Michigan.

Computerized physician order entry (CPOE) linked with clinical decision support has been found to reduce the serious medication error rate; serious medication errors are those which harm someone or have the potential to do so. In one study, CPOE, even with limited decision support, decreased the serious medication error rate by 55%. CPOE can prevent medication errors by suggesting a default dose, ensuring that all orders are complete (e.g., include a dose, route, and frequency), and checking orders for allergies, drug-drug interactions, and drug-laboratory issues. In addition, clinical decision support can suggest the right dose for a patient, tailoring it to the patients level of renal function and age. In one study, without decision support patients with renal insufficiency received the appropriate dose only one-third of the time, whereas that fraction increased to approximately two-thirds with decision support, and patients with renal insufficiency were discharged from the hospital one-half day earlier. As of 2009, only about 15% of U.S. hospitals had implemented CPOE, but many plan to do so and will receive major financial incentives for achieving this goal.

Another technology that can improve medication safety is bar coding linked with an electronic medication administration record. Bar coding can help ensure that the right patient gets the right medication at the right time. Electronic medication administration records can make it much easier to determine what medications a patient has received. Studies to assess the impact of bar coding on medication safety are under way, and the early results are promising. Another technology that can be used to improve the safety of medication administration is "smart pumps." These are pumps that can be instructed in which medication is being given and at what dose; if the nurse tries to administer too high a dose, he or she will receive a warning.

The National Picture Around Safety

Several organizations, including the National Quality Forum (NQF) and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), have made recommendations about how to improve safety. In particular, the NQF has released recommendations to the countrys hospitals about what practices will most improve the safety of care, which all hospitals are expected to implement (Table 10-1). Many of these practices arise frequently in routine care. One example is "readback," the practice of recording all verbal orders and immediately reading them back to the physician to verify the accuracy of what was heard. Another is to use only standard abbreviations and dose designations, since some abbreviations and dose designations are particularly prone to error; for example, 7U may be read as 70.

Table 10-1 Safe Practices for Better Health Carea

 
 
1. Create a health care culture of safety. 
2. For designated high-risk, elective surgical procedures or other specified care, patients should be clearly informed of the likely reduced risk of an adverse outcome at treatment facilities that have demonstrated superior outcomes and should be referred to such facilities in accordance with the patients stated preference. 
3. Specify an explicit protocol to be used to ensure an adequate level of nursing based on the institutions usual patient mix and the experience and training of its nursing staff. 
4. All patients in general intensive care units (both adult and pediatric) should be managed by physicians who have specific training and certification in critical care medicine ("critical care certified"). 
5. Pharmacists should participate actively in the medication-use process, including, at a minimum, being available for consultation with prescribers on medication ordering, interpretation and review of medication orders; preparation of medications; dispensing of medications; and administration and monitoring of medications. 
6. Verbal orders should be recorded whenever possible and immediately read back to the prescriber; i.e., a health care provider receiving a verbal order should read or repeat back the information that the prescriber conveys to verify the accuracy of what was heard. 
7. Use only standardized abbreviations and dose designations. 
8. Patient care summaries or other similar records should not be prepared from memory. 
9. Ensure that care information, especially changes in orders and new diagnostic information, is transmitted in a timely and clearly understandable form to all of the patients current health care providers who need that information to provide care. 
10. Ask each patient or legal surrogate to recount what he or she has been told during the informed consent discussion. 
11. Ensure that written documentation of the patients preference for life-sustaining treatments is displayed prominently displayed in his or her chart. 
12. Implement a computerized prescriber order entry system. 
13. Implement a standardized protocol to prevent the mislabeling of radiographs. 
14. Implement standardized protocols to prevent the occurrence of wrong-site procedures or wrong-patient procedures. 
15. Evaluate each patient undergoing elective surgery for risk of an acute ischemic cardiac event during surgery and provide prophylactic treatment of high-risk patients with beta blockers. 
16. Evaluate each patient upon admission, and regularly thereafter, for the risk of developing pressure ulcers. This evaluation should be repeated at regular intervals during care. Clinically appropriate preventive methods should be implemented consequent to the evaluation. 
17. Evaluate each patient upon admission, and regularly thereafter, for the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/venous thromboembolism (VTE). Utilize clinically appropriate methods to prevent DVT/VTE. 
18. Utilize dedicated antithrombotic (anticoagulation) services that facilitate coordinated care management. 
19. Upon admission, and regularly thereafter, evaluate each patient for the risk of aspiration. 
20. Adhere to effective methods of preventing central venous catheter¨Cassociated bloodstream infections. 
21. Evaluate each preoperative patient in light of his or her planned surgical procedure for the risk of surgical site infection and implement appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis and other preventive measures based on that evaluation. 
22. Utilize validated protocols to evaluate patients who are at risk for contrast media-induced renal failure and utilize a clinically appropriate method for reducing risk of renal injury based on the patients kidney function evaluation. 
23. Evaluate each patient upon admission, and regularly thereafter, for risk of malnutrition. Employ clinically appropriate strategies to prevent malnutrition. 
24. Whenever a pneumatic tourniquet is used, evaluate the patient for the risk of an ischemic and/or thrombotic complication and utilize appropriate prophylactic measures. 
25. Decontaminate hands with a hygienic hand rub or by washing with a disinfectant soap before and after direct contact with the patient or objects immediately around the patient. 
26. Vaccinate health care workers against influenza to protect both them and patients from influenza. 
27. Keep workspaces where medications are prepared clean, orderly, well lit, and free of clutter, distraction, and noise. 
28. Standardize the methods for labeling, packaging, and storing medications. 
29. Identify all "high alert" drugs (e.g., intravenous adrenergic agonists and antagonists, chemotherapy agents, anticoagulants and antithrombotics, concentrated parenteral electrolytes, general anesthetics, neuromuscular blockers, insulin and oral hypoglycemics, and narcotics and opiates). 
30. Dispense medications in unit-dose or, when appropriate, unit-of-use form, whenever possible. 
 


a These 30 practices are the recommendations from the National Quality Forum (NQF) for improving the safety of health care; the NQF believes they should be implemented universally in applicable care settings to reduce the risk of patient harm. The practices all have strong supporting evidence and are likely to have a significant benefit.
 

Measurement of Safety

Measuring the safety of care is quite difficult and expensive, since adverse events are, fortunately, rare. Most hospitals rely on spontaneous reporting to identify errors and adverse events, but this approach has very low sensitivity, with only ~1 in 20 ADEs reported. There are promising research techniques that involve searching the electronic record for signals suggesting that an adverse event has occurred, which probably will be routine in the future but are not yet in wide use. Claims data have been used to identify the frequency of adverse events; this approach works much better for surgical care than for medical care and still requires additional validation. The net result is that except for a few specific types of events, such as falls and nosocomial infections, hospitals have little idea about the true frequency of safety issues.

Nonetheless, all providers have the responsibility to report problems with safety as they are identified. All hospitals have spontaneous reporting systems, and if providers report events as they occur, those events can be used as lessons for subsequent improvement.

Conclusions About Safety

It is now abundantly clear that the safety of health care can be improved substantially; as more areas are studied closely, more problems are identified. Compared with the outpatient setting, much more is known about the epidemiology of safety in the inpatient setting, and a number of effective strategies for improving safety have been identified and are being used increasingly. Some effective strategies are also available in the outpatient setting. Transitions appear to be especially risky. The solutions to improving care often will involve systematic techniques such as checklists and often will involve leveraging information technology, but they also will include many other domains, such as use of human factors techniques, team training, and building a culture of safety.

Quality in Health Care

Quality of care has remained somewhat elusive, although the tools for measuring it have increasingly improved. Selecting health care and measuring its quality is a complex process.

Quality Theory

Donabedian has suggested that quality of care can be categorized by type of measurement into structure, process, and outcome. Structure refers to whether a particular characteristic is present, e.g., whether a hospital has a catheterization laboratory or whether a clinic uses an electronic health record. Process refers to the way care is delivered, and examples of process measures are whether a Pap smear was performed at the recommended interval or whether an aspirin was given to a patient with a suspected myocardial infarction. Outcomes refer to what actually happens, e.g., the mortality rate in myocardial infarction. It is important to note that good structure and process do not always result in good outcomes. For instance, a patient may present with a suspected myocardial infarction to an institution with a catheterization laboratory and receive recommended care, including aspirin, but still die because of the infarction.

Quality theory also suggests that overall quality will be improved more in the aggregate by raising the level of performance of all providers rather than finding a few poor performers and punishing them. This view suggests that systems changes are especially likely to be helpful in improving quality, since large numbers of providers may be affected simultaneously.

The theory of continuous quality improvement suggests that organizations should be evaluating the care they deliver on an ongoing basis and continually making small changes to improve their individual processes. This approach can be very powerful if embraced over time.

A number of specific tools have been developed to help improve process performance. One of the most important is the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle (Fig. 10-2). This approach can be used to perform what is called rapid cycle improvement for a process, e.g., the time for a patient with pneumonia to receive antibiotics after diagnosis. Often, specific statistical tools such as control charts are used in conjunction to determine whether progress is being made. Most medical care includes one or many processes, making this tool especially important for improvement.

Figure 10-2

 
 
 
Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle. The PDCA cycle approach can be used to improve a specific process rapidly. First, planning is performed, and several potential improvement strategies are identified. Next, these strategies are trialed in small "tests of change." "Checking" entails measuring whether they appeared to make a difference, and "act" refers to acting on the results.
 
 

Factors Relating to Quality

Many factors can decrease the level of quality, including stress to providers, high or low levels of production pressure, and poor systems, to name but a few examples. Stress can have an adverse effect on quality because it can lead providers to omit important steps, as can a high level of production pressure. Low levels of production pressure sometimes can result in worse quality, as providers may be bored or have little experience with a specific problem. Poor systems can have a tremendous impact on quality, and even extremely dedicated providers typically cannot achieve high levels of performance if they are operating within a poor system.

Data About the Current State of Quality

A recent RAND study has provided the most complete picture of quality of care delivered in the United States to date. The results were sobering. The authors found that across a wide range of quality parameters, patients in the United States received only 55% of recommended care overall; there was little variation by subtype, with scores of 54% for preventive care, 54% for acute care, and 56% for care of chronic conditions, leading the authors to conclude that the chances of getting high-quality care in the United States broadly were little better than those of winning a coin flip.

Work from the Dartmouth Atlas evaluating geographic variation in utilization and quality of care demonstrates that despite large variations in utilization, there is no positive correlation between the two variables at the regional level. An array of data demonstrate, however, that providers with larger volumes for specific conditions, especially for surgical conditions, do have better outcomes.

Strategies for Improving Quality and Performance

A number of specific strategies can be used to improve quality at the individual level, including rationing, education, feedback, incentives, and penalties. Rationing has been effective in some specific areas, such as persuading physicians to prescribe within a formulary, but it generally has been resisted. Education is effective in the short run and is necessary for changing opinions, but its effect decays fairly rapidly with time. Feedback on performance can be given either at the group or the individual level. Feedback is most effective if it is individualized and is given in close temporal proximity to the original events. Incentives can be effective, and many believe that this will be a key to improving quality, especially if pay-for-performance with sufficient incentives is broadly implemented (see below). Penalties produce provider resentment and rarely are used in health care.

Another set of strategies for improving quality involves changing the systems of care. An example would be introducing reminders about which specific actions need to be taken at a visit for a specific patient, a strategy that has been demonstrated to improve performance in certain situations, e.g., the delivery of preventive services. Another approach that has been effective is the development of "bundles" or groups of quality measures that can be implemented together with a high degree of fidelity. A number of hospitals have implemented a bundle for ventilator-associated pneumonia in the intensive care unit, which includes five measures, including, for example, ensuring that the head of the bed is elevated. The hospitals have found that they were able to improve performance substantially.

Perhaps the most pressing need is to improve the quality of care for chronic diseases. The Chronic Care Model has been developed by Wagner and colleagues (Fig. 10-3); it suggests that a combination of strategies will be necessary, including self-management support, changes in delivery system design, decision support, and information systems, and that these strategies must be delivered by a practice team composed of several providers, not just a physician.

Figure 10-3

 
 
 
The chronic care model. The chronic care model, which focuses on improving care for chronic diseases, suggests that delivery of high-quality care requires a range of strategies that must closely involve and engage the patient and, in addition, that team care is essential. (From EH Wagner et al: Eff Clin Pract 1:2, 1998.)
 
 

Recent evidence about the relative efficacy of strategies in reducing hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in outpatient diabetes care supports this general premise. It is especially notable that the outcome was HbA1c, as it has generally been much more difficult to improve outcome measures than process measures (such as whether an HbA1c was performed). In this meta-analysis, a variety of strategies were effective, but the most effective ones were the use of team changes and the use of a case manager. When cost-effectiveness is considered in addition, it appears likely that an amalgam of strategies will be needed. However, the more expensive strategies, such as the use of case managers, probably will be implemented widely only if pay-for-performance takes hold.

National State of Quality Measurement

In the inpatient setting, quality measurement is now being performed by a very large proportion of hospitals for several conditions, including myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, pneumonia, and surgical infection prevention; 20 measures are included in all. This is the result of the Hospital Quality Initiative, which represents a collaboration among many entities, including the Hospital Quality Alliance, the JCAHO, the NQF, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, among others. The data are housed at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which publicly releases performance on the measures on a website called Hospital Compare. These data are reported voluntarily and are available for a very high proportion of the nations hospitals. Analyses demonstrate that there is substantial regional variation in quality and that there are important differences among hospitals. Analyses by the Joint Commission for very similar indicators demonstrate that performance on measures by hospitals did improve over time and that, as might be hoped, lower performers improved more than did higher performers.

Public Reporting

Overall, public reporting of quality data is becoming increasingly common. There are now commercial websites that have quality-related data for most regions of the country that can be accessed for a fee. Similarly, national data for hospitals are available. The evidence to date is that patients have not used such data very much but that the data have had an important effect on provider and organization behavior. Instead, patients have relied on provider reputation to make choices. Part of the reason for this choice basis is that until very recently little information was available, and it was not necessarily presented in ways that were easy for patients to access. Many believe that as more information about quality becomes available, it will become increasingly central to patient choices about where to access care.

Pay-for-Performance

Currently, providers in the United States get paid exactly the same amount for a specific service regardless of what quality of care is delivered. The theory of pay-for-performance suggests that if providers are paid more for higher-quality care, they will invest in strategies that enable them to deliver that care. The current key issues in the pay-for-performance debate relate to (1) how effective it is, (2) what levels of incentives are needed, and (3) what perverse consequences are produced. The evidence about effectiveness is fairly limited, although a number of studies are ongoing. With respect to levels, most performance incentives around quality have accounted for merely 1¨C2% of total payment in this country to date, but in the United Kingdom, 40% of general practitioners salaries have recently been placed at risk based on performance across a wide array of parameters. This has been associated with large improvements in reported quality performance, although it is still unclear to what extent this represents better performance versus better reporting. The potential for perverse consequences exists with any incentive scheme. One problem is that if incentives are tied to outcomes, this introduces the incentive to transfer the sickest patients to other providers and systems. Another concern is that providers will pay too much attention to quality measures with incentives and ignore the rest of the quality picture. The validity of these concerns remains to be determined.

Conclusions

The safety and quality of care in the United States could be improved substantially. A number of interventions are available today that have been demonstrated to improve the safety of care and should be used more widely; others are undergoing evaluation or will be evaluated. Quality also could be dramatically better, and the science of quality improvement is increasingly mature. Implementation of pay-for-performance should make it much easier for organizations to justify investments in improving these parameters, including health information technology; however, many will also require changing the structure of care, e.g., moving to a more team-oriented approach, and ensuring that the patients are more involved in their own care. Measures of safety are still relatively immature and could be made much more robust; it would be particularly useful if organizations had measures they could use in routine operations to assess safety at a reasonable cost. Although the quality measures available are more robust than those for safety, they still cover a relatively small proportion of the entire domain of quality, and more need to be developed. The public and payers are demanding better information about safety and quality as well as better performance in these areas. The clear implication is that these domains will have to be addressed directly by providers.

Primary Care in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Introduction

The twentieth century witnessed the rise of an unprecedented global health divide. Industrialized or high-income countries experienced rapid improvement in standards of living, nutrition, health, and health care. Meanwhile, in low- and middle-income countries with much less favorable conditions, health and health care progressed much more slowly. The scale of this divide is reflected in the current extremes of life expectancy at birth, with Japan at the high end (82 years) and Sierra Leone at the low end (32 years). This 50-year difference reflects the daunting range of health challenges faced by low- and middle-income countries. These nations are faced not only with a complex mixture of diseases (both infectious and chronic) and illness-promoting conditions but, more fundamentally, with the fragility of the foundations underlying good health (e.g., sufficient food, water, sanitation, and education) and of the systems necessary for universal access to good-quality health care. In the last decades of the twentieth century, the need to bridge this global health divide and establish health equity was increasingly recognized. The Declaration of Alma Ata in 1978 crystallized a vision of justice in health, regardless of income, gender, ethnicity, or education, and called for "health for all by the year 2000" through primary health care. While much progress has been made since the declaration, at the end of the first decade of the twenty-first century, much remains to be done to achieve global health equity.

This chapter looks first at the nature of the health challenges in low- and middle-income countries that underlie the health divide. It then outlines the values and principles of a primary health care approach with a focus on primary care services. Next, the chapter reviews the experience of low- and middle-income countries in addressing health challenges through primary care and a primary health care approach. Finally, the chapter identifies how current challenges and global context provide an agenda and opportunities for the renewal of primary health care and primary care.
 
Primary Care and Primary Health Care

The term primary care has been used in many different ways: to describe a level of care or setting of the health system, a set of treatment and prevention activities carried out by specific personnel, a set of attributes for the way care is delivered, or an approach to organizing health systems that is synonymous with the term primary health care. In 1996, the U.S. Institute of Medicine encompassed many of these different usages, defining primary care as "the provision of integrated, accessible health care services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a large majority of personal health care needs, developing a sustained partnership with patients, and practicing in the context of family and community."1 We use this definition of primary care in this chapter. Primary care performs an essential function for health systems, providing the first point of contact when people seek health care, dealing with most problems, and referring patients onward to other services when necessary. As is increasingly evident in countries of all income levels, without strong primary care, health systems cannot function properly or address the health challenges of the communities they serve.

Primary care is only one part of a primary health care approach. The Declaration of Alma Ata, drafted in 1978 at the International Conference on Primary Health Care in Alma Ata (now Almaty in Kazakhstan), identified many features of primary care as being essential to achieving the goal of "health for all by the year 2000." However, it also identified the need to work across different sectors, address the social and economic factors that determine health, mobilize the participation of communities in health systems, and ensure the use and development of technology that was appropriate in terms of setting and cost. The declaration drew from the experiences of low- and middle-income countries in trying to improve the health of their people following independence. Commonly, these countries had built hospital-based systems similar to those in high-income countries. This effort had resulted in the development of high-technology services in urban areas while leaving the bulk of the population without access to health care unless they traveled great distances to these urban facilities. Furthermore, much of the population lacked access to basic public health measures. Primary health care efforts aimed to move care closer to where people lived, to ensure their involvement in decisions about their own health care, and to address key aspects of the physical and social environment essential to health such as water, sanitation, and education.

After the Declaration of Alma Ata, many countries implemented reforms of their health systems based on primary health care. Most progress involved strengthening of primary care services; unexpectedly, however, much of this progress was seen in high-income countries, most of which constructed systems that made primary care available at low or no cost to their entire populations and that delivered the bulk of services in primary care settings. This endeavor also saw the reinforcement of family medicine as a specialty to provide primary care services. Even in the United States (an obvious exception to this trend), it became clear that the populations of states with more primary care physicians and services were healthier than those with fewer such resources.

Progress was also made in many low- and middle-income countries. However, the target of "health for all by the year 2000" was missed by a large margin. The reasons were complex but partly entailed a general failure to implement all aspects of the primary health care approach, particularly work across sectors to address social and economic factors that affect health and provision of sufficient human and other resources to make possible the access to primary care attained in high-income countries. Furthermore, despite the consensus in Alma Ata in 1978, the global health community rapidly became fractured in its commitment to the far-reaching measures called for by the declaration. Economic recession tempered enthusiasm for primary health care, and momentum shifted to programs concentrating on a few priority measures such as immunization, oral rehydration, breast-feeding, and growth monitoring for child survival. Success with these initiatives supported the continued movement of health development efforts away from the comprehensive approach of primary health care and toward programs that targeted specific public health priorities. This approach was reinforced by the need to address the HIV/AIDSepidemic. By the 1990s, primary health care had fallen out of favor in many global-health policy circles, and low- and middle-income countries were being encouraged to reduce public sector spending on health and to focus on cost-effectiveness analysis to provide a package of health care measures thought to offer the greatest health benefits.
 
Health Challenges in Low- and Middle-Income Countries

Low- and middle-income countries, defined by a per capita gross national income of <$12,000 (U.S.) per person per year, account for >80% of the world's population. Average life expectancy in these countries lags far behind that in high-income countries: whereas the average life expectancy at birth in high-income countries is 74 years, it is only 68 years in middle-income countries and 58 years in low-income countries. This discrepancy has received growing attention over the past 40 years. Initially, the situation in poor countries was characterized primarily in terms of high fertility and high infant, child, and maternal mortality rates, with most deaths and illnesses attributable to infectious or tropical diseases among remote, largely rural populations. With growing adult (and especially elderly) populations and changing lifestyles linked to global forces of urbanization, a new set of health challenges characterized by chronic diseases, environmental overcrowding, and road traffic injuries has emerged rapidly (Fig. e1-1). The majority of tobacco-related deaths globally now occur in low- and middle-income countries, and the risk of a child's dying from a road traffic injury in Africa is more than twice that in Europe. Hence, low- and middle-income countries in the twenty-first century face a full spectrum of health challenges¡ªinfectious, chronic, and injury-related¡ªat much higher incidences and prevalences than are documented in high-income countries and with many fewer resources to address these challenges.

Addressing these challenges, however, does not mean simply waiting for economic growth. Analysis of the association between wealth and health across countries reveals that, for any given level of wealth, there is a substantial variation in life expectancy at birth that has persisted despite overall global progress in life expectancy during the past 30 years (Fig. e1-2). Health status in low- and middle-income countries varies enormously. Nations such as Cuba and Costa Rica have life expectancies and childhood mortality rates similar to or even better than those in high-income countries; in contrast, countries in sub-Saharan Africa and the former Soviet bloc have experienced significant reverses in these health markers in the past 20 years.

As Angus Deaton stated in the WIDER annual lecture on September 29, 2006, "People in poor countries are sick not primarily because they are poor but because of other social organizational failures including health delivery, which are not automatically ameliorated by higher income." This analysis concurs with classic studies of the array of societal factors explaining good health in poor settings such as Cuba and Kerala State in India. Analyses conducted over the past three decades indeed show that rapid health improvement is possible in very different contexts. That some countries continue to lag far behind can be understood through a comparison of regional differences in progress in terms of life expectancy over this period (Fig. e1-3). While most regions have made impressive progress, sub-Saharan Africa and the former Soviet states have seen stagnation and even reversals.

As average levels of health vary across regions and countries, so too do they vary within countries (Fig. e1-4). Indeed, disparities within countries are often greater than those between high-income and low-income countries. For example, if low- and middle-income countries could reduce their overall childhood mortality rate to that of the richest one-fifth of their populations, global childhood mortality could be decreased by 40%. Disparities in health are mostly a result of social and economic factors such as daily living conditions, access to resources, and ability to participate in life-affecting decisions. In most countries, the health care sector actually tends to exacerbate health inequalities (the "inverse-care law"); because of neglect and discrimination, poor and marginalized communities are much less likely to benefit from public health services than those that are better off. Reforming health systems toward people-centered primary care provides an opportunity to reverse these negative trends.

Health services have failed to make their contribution to reducing these pervasive social inequalities by ensuring universal access to existing, scientifically validated, low-cost interventions such as insecticide-treated bed nets for malaria, taxes on cigarettes, short-course chemotherapy for tuberculosis, antibiotic treatment for pneumonia, dietary modification and secondary prevention measures for high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels, and water treatment and oral rehydration therapy for diarrhea. Despite decades of "essential packages" and "basic" health campaigns, the effective implementation of what is already known to work appears (deceptively) to be difficult.

Recent analyses have begun to focus on "the how" (as opposed to "the what") of health care delivery, exploring why health progress is slow and sluggish despite the abundant availability of proven interventions for health conditions in low- and middle-income countries. Three general categories of reasons are being identified: (1) shortfalls in performance of health systems; (2) stratifying social conditions; and (3) skews in science.

Shortfalls in Performance of Health Systems

Specific health problems often require the development of specific health intervention (e.g., tuberculosis requires short-course chemotherapy). However, the delivery of different interventions is often facilitated by a common set of resources or functions: money or financing, trained health workers, and facilities with reliable supplies fit for multiple purposes. Unfortunately, the current state of health systems in most low- and middle-income countries is largely dysfunctional.

In the large majority of low- and middle-income countries, the level of public financing for health is woefully insufficient: whereas high-income countries spend, on average, 7% of the gross domestic product on health, middle-income countries spend <4% and low-income countries <3%. External financing for health through various donor channels has grown significantly over time. While these funds for health are significant [~$20 billion (U.S.) in 2008 for low- and middle-income countries] and have been growing in the past decade, they represent <2% of total health expenditures in low- and middle-income countries and hence are neither a sufficient nor a long-term solution to chronic underfinancing. In Africa, 70% of health expenditures come from domestic sources. The predominant form of health care financing¡ªcharging patients at the point of service¡ªis the least efficient and the most inequitable, tipping millions of households into poverty annually.

Health workers, who represent another critical resource, are often inadequately trained and supported in their work. Recent estimates indicate a shortage of >4 million health workers, constituting a crisis that is greatly exacerbated by the migration of health workers from low- and middle-income countries to high-income countries. Sub-Saharan Africa carries 24% of the global disease burden but has only 3% of the health workforce (Fig. e1-5). The International Organization for Migration estimated in 2006 that there were more Ethiopian physicians practicing in Chicago than in Ethiopia itself.

Figure e1-5

 
 
 
Global burden of disease and health workforce.(Source: World Health Organization, 2006.)
 
 

Critical diagnostics and drugs often do not reach patients in need because of supply chain failures. Moreover, facilities fail to provide safe care: new evidence suggests much higher rates of adverse events among hospitalized patients in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. Weak government planning, regulatory, monitoring, and evaluation capacities are associated with rampant, unregulated commercialization of health services and chaotic fragmentation of these services as donors "push" their respective priority programs. With such fragile foundations, it is not surprising that low-cost, affordable, validated interventions are not reaching those who need them.

Stratifying Social Conditions

Health care delivery systems do not exist in a vacuum but rather are embedded in a complex of social and economic forces that often stratify opportunities for health unfairly. Most worrisome are the pervasive forces of social inequality that serve to marginalize populations with disproportionately large health needs (e.g., the urban poor; illiterate mothers). Why should a poor slum dweller with no income be expected to come up with the money for a bus fare needed to travel to a clinic to learn the results of a sputum test for tuberculosis? How can a mother living in a remote rural village and caring for an infant with febrile convulsions find the means to get her child to appropriate care? Shaky or nonexistent social security systems, dangerous work environments, isolated communities with little or no infrastructure, and systematic discrimination against minorities are among the myriad forces with which efforts for more equitable health care delivery must contend.

Skews in Science

While science has yielded enormous breakthroughs in health in high-income countries, with some spillover to low- and middle-income countries, many important health problems continue to affect primarily low- and middle-income countries whose research and development investments are woefully insufficient. The past decade has seen growing efforts to right this imbalance with research and development investment for new drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics that effectively cater to the specific health needs of populations in low- and middle-income countries. For example, the Medicines for Malaria Venture has revitalized a previously "dry" pipeline for new malaria drugs. This is but one of many such efforts, but much more needs to be done.

As discussed above, the primary constraint on better health in low- and middle-income countries is related less to the availability of health technologies and more to their effective delivery. Underlying these systems and social challenges to greater equity in health is a major bias regarding what constitutes legitimate "science" to improve health equity. The lion's share of health research financing is channeled toward the development of new technologies¡ªdrugs, vaccines, and diagnostics; in contrast, virtually no resources are directed toward research on how health care delivery systems can become more reliable and overcome adverse social conditions. The complexity of systems and social context is such that this issue of delivery requires an enormous investment in terms not only of money but also of scientific rigor, with the development of new research methods and measures and the attainment of greater legitimacy in the mainstream scientific establishment.

These common challenges to low- and middle-income countries partly explain the resurgence of interest in the primary health care approach. In some countries (mostly middle-income), significant progress has been made in expanding coverage by health systems based on primary care and even in improving indicators of population health. More countries are embarking on the creation of primary care services despite the challenges that exist, particularly in low-income countries. Even when these challenges are acknowledged, there are many reasons for optimism that low- and middle-income countries can accelerate progress in building primary care.
 
Primary Health Care in the Twenty-First Century

The past decade has seen a resurgence of interest in primary health care as a means of addressing the global health challenges of the new millennium. This interest has been driven by many of the same issues that led to the Declaration of Alma Ata: rapidly increasing disparities in health between and within countries, spiraling costs of health care at a time when many people lack quality care, dissatisfaction of communities with the care they are able to access, and failure to address changes in health threats, especially noncommunicable disease epidemics. These challenges require a comprehensive approach and strong health systems with effective primary care. Global health development agencies have recognized that sustaining gains in public health priorities such as HIV/AIDS requires not only robust health systems but also the tackling of social and economic factors related to disease incidence and progression. Weak health systems have proved a major obstacle to delivering new technologies such as antiretroviral therapy, to all who need them. Changing disease patterns have led to a demand for health systems that can treat people as individuals whether or not they present to a health facility with the public health "priority" (e.g., HIV/AIDS or tuberculosis) to which that facility is targeted. We discuss experiences in low- and middle-income countries in relation to primary care in greater detail below. First, we consider the features of primary health care and primary care as currently understood.

Revitalization of Primary Health Care

At the 2009 World Health Assembly [an annual meeting of all countries to discuss the work of the World Health Organization (WHO)], a resolution was passed reaffirming the principles of the Declaration of Alma Ata and the need for national health systems to be based on primary health care. This resolution did not suggest that nothing had changed in the intervening 30 years since the declaration nor that its prescription did not need reframing in light of changing public health needs. The 2008 WHO World Health Report describes how a primary health care approach is necessary "now more than ever" to address global health priorities, especially in terms of disparities and new health challenges. It highlights four broad areas where reform is required (Fig. e1-6), as discussed below. One of these areas¡ªthe need to organize health care so that it places the needs of people first¡ªessentially relates to the necessity for strong primary care in health systems and what this requirement entails. The other three areas also relate to primary care. All four areas require action to move health systems in a direction that will reduce disparities and increase the satisfaction of those they serve. The World Health Report's recommendations present a vision of primary health care that is based on the principles of Alma Ata but that differs from many attempts to implement primary health care in the 1970s and 1980s.

Service Delivery Reforms to Make Health Systems People-Centered

Health systems have often been organized around the needs of those who provide health care services such as clinicians and policy makers. The result is a centralization of services or the provision of vertical programs that target single diseases. The principles of primary health care, including the development of primary care, reorient care around the needs of the people to whom services cater. This "people-centered" approach aims to provide health care that is both more effective and appropriate.

The increase in noncommunicable diseases in low- and middle-income countries offers a further stimulus for urgent reform of service delivery to improve chronic disease care. As discussed above, large numbers of people currently fail to receive relatively low-cost interventions that have reduced the incidence of these diseases in high-income countries. Delivery of these interventions requires health systems that can address multiple problems and manage people over a long period within their own communities, yet many low- and middle-income countries are only now starting to adapt and build primary care services that can address noncommunicable diseases and communicable diseases requiring chronic care. Even some countries (e.g., Iran) that have had significant success in reducing communicable diseases and improving child survival have been slow to adapt their health systems to rapidly accelerating noncommunicable disease epidemics.

People-centered care requires a safe, comprehensive, and integrated response to the needs of those presenting to health systems, with treatment at the first point of contact or referral to appropriate services. Because no discrete boundary separates people's needs for health promotion, curative interventions, and rehabilitation services across different diseases, primary care services must address all presenting problems in a unified way. Meeting people's needs also involves improved communication between patients and their clinicians, who must take the time to understand the impact of the patients' social context on the problems they present with. This enhanced understanding is made possible by improvements in the continuity of care so that responsibility transcends the limited time people spend in health care facilities. Primary care plays a vital role in navigating people through the health system; when people are referred elsewhere for services, primary care providers must monitor the resulting consultations and perform follow-up. All too often, people do not receive the benefit of complex interventions undertaken in hospitals because they lose contact with the health care system once discharged. Comprehensiveness and continuity of care are best achieved by ensuring that people have an ongoing personal relationship with a care team.

Universal Coverage Reforms to Improve Health Equity

Despite progress in many countries, most people in the world can receive health care services only if they can pay at the point of service. Disparities in health are caused not only by a lack of access to necessary health services but also by the impact of expenditure on health. More than 100 million people are driven into poverty each year by health care costs. Universal coverage is therefore a major priority in low- and middle-income countries. Increasing coverage of health services can be considered in terms of three axes: the proportion of the population covered, the range of services underwritten, and the percentage of costs paid. Moving toward universal coverage requires ensuring the availability of health care services to all, eliminating barriers to access, and organizing pooled financing mechanisms such as taxation or insurance, to remove user fees at the point of service. It also requires measures beyond financing, including expansion of health services in poorly served areas, improvement in the quality of services provided to marginalized communities, and increased coverage of other social services that significantly affect health (e.g., education).

Public Policy Reforms to Promote and Protect the Health of Communities

Public policies in sectors other than health care are essential to reduce disparities in health and to make progress toward global public health targets. The 2008 final report of the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health provides an exhaustive review of the intersectoral policies required to address health inequities at the local, national, and global levels. Advances against major challenges such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, emerging pandemics, cardiovascular disease, cancers, and injuries require effective collaboration with sectors such as transport, housing, labor, agriculture, urban planning, trade, and energy. While tobacco control provides a striking example of what is possible if different sectors work together toward health goals, the lack of implementation of many evidence-based tobacco control measures in most countries just as clearly illustrates the difficulties encountered in such intersectoral work and the unrealized potential of public policies to improve health. At the local level, primary care services can help enact health-promoting public policies in other sectors.

Leadership Reforms to Make Health Authorities More Reliable

The Declaration of Alma Ata emphasized the importance of participation by people in their own health care. In fact, participation is important at all levels of decision making. Contemporary health challenges require new models of leadership that acknowledge the role of government in reducing disparities in health but that also recognize the many types of organizations that provide health care services. Governments need to guide and negotiate among these different groups, including nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector, and to provide strong regulation where necessary. This difficult task requires a massive reinvestment in leadership and governance capacity, especially if action by different sectors is to be effectively implemented. Moreover, disadvantaged groups must be able to voice their health needs in a way that actively influences decision making.

Experiences with Primary Care in Low- and Middle-Income Countries

Aspects of the primary health care approach described above, with an emphasis on primary care services, have been implemented to varying degrees in many low- and middle-income countries over the past half-century. As discussed above, some of these experiences inspired and informed the Declaration of Alma Ata, which itself led many more countries to attempt to implement primary health care. This section describes the experiences of a selection of low- and middle-income countries in improving primary care services that have enhanced the health of their populations.

Before Alma Ata, few countries had attempted to develop primary health care on a national level. Rather, most focused on expanding primary care services to specific communities (often rural villages), making use of community volunteers to compensate for the absence of facility-based care. In contrast, in the post¨CWorld War II period, China invested in primary care on a national scale, and life expectancy doubled within roughly 20 years. The Chinese expansion of primary care services included a massive investment in infrastructure for public health (e.g., water and sanitation systems) linked to innovative use of community health workers. These "barefoot doctors" lived in and expanded care to rural villages. They received a basic level of training that enabled them to provide immunizations, maternal care, and basic medical interventions, including the use of antibiotics. Through the work of the barefoot doctors, China brought low-cost universal basic health care coverage to its entire population, most of which had previously had no access to these services.

In 1982, the Rockefeller Foundation convened a conference to review the experiences of China along with those of Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, and the state of Kerala in India. In all of these locations, good health care at low cost appeared to have been achieved. Despite lower levels of economic development and health spending, all of these jurisdictions, along with Cuba, had health indicators approaching¡ªor in some cases exceeding¡ªthose of developed countries. Analysis of these experiences revealed a common emphasis on primary care services, with expansion of care to the entire population free of charge or at low cost, combined with community participation in decision making about health services and coordinated work in different sectors (especially education) toward health goals. During the three decades since the Rockefeller meeting, some of these countries have built on this progress, while others have experienced setbacks. Recent experiences in developing primary care services show that the same combination of features is necessary for success. For example, Brazil¡ªa large country with a dispersed population¡ªhas made major strides in increasing the availability of health care in the past 20 years. In the past decade, the Brazilian Family Health Program has expanded progressively across the country, with almost all areas now covered. This program provides communities with free access to primary care teams made up of primary care physicians, community health workers, nurses, dentists, obstetricians, and pediatricians. These teams have responsibility for the health of people in a specified geographic area¡ªnot only those who access health clinics. Moreover, individual community health workers are responsible for a named list of people within the area covered by the primary care team. Problems with access to health care persist in Brazil, especially in isolated areas and urban slums. However, solid evidence indicates that the Family Health Program has already contributed to impressive gains in population health, particularly in terms of childhood mortality and health inequities. In fact, this program has already had an especially marked impact on childhood mortality reduction in less-developed areas (Fig. e1-7).

Chile has also built on its existing primary care services in the past decade, aiming to improve the quality of care and the extent of coverage in remote areas, above all for disadvantaged populations. This effort has been made in concert with measures aimed at reducing social inequalities and fostering development, including social welfare benefits for families and disadvantaged groups and increased access to early-childhood educational facilities. As in Brazil, these steps have improved maternal and child health and have reduced health inequities. In addition to directly enhancing primary care services, Brazil and Chile have instituted measures to increase both the accountability of health providers and the participation of communities in decision making. In Brazil, national and regional health assemblies with high levels of public participation are integral parts of the health policy¨Cmaking process. Chile has instituted a patient's charter that explicitly specifies the rights of patients in terms of the range of services to which they are entitled.

Other countries that have made recent progress with primary health care include Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries in the world. Since achieving its independence from Pakistan in 1971, Bangladesh has seen a dramatic increase in life expectancy, and childhood mortality rates are now lower than those in neighboring nations such as India and Pakistan. The expansion of access to primary health care services has played a major role in these achievements. This progress has been spearheaded by a vibrant NGO community that has focused its attention on improving the lives and livelihoods of poor women and their families through innovative and integrated microcredit, education, and primary care programs.

The above examples, along with others from the past 30 years in countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Portugal, and Oman, illustrate how the implementation of a primary health care approach, with a greater emphasis on primary care, has led to better access to health care services¡ªa trend that has not been seen in many other low- and middle-income countries. This trend, in turn, has contributed to improvements in population health and reductions in health inequities. However, as these nations have progressed, other countries have shown how previous gains with primary care can easily be eroded. In sub-Saharan Africa, undermining of primary care services has contributed to catastrophic reverses in health outcomes catalyzed by the HIV/AIDSepidemic. Countries such as Botswana and Zimbabwe implemented primary health care strategies in the 1980s, increasing access to care and making impressive gains in child health. Both countries have since been severely affected by HIV/AIDS, with pronounced decreases in life expectancy. However, Zimbabwe has also seen political turmoil, a decline of health and other social services, and the flight of health personnel, whereas Botswana has maintained primary care services to a greater extent and has managed to organize widespread access to antiretroviral therapy for people living with HIV/AIDS. Zimbabwe's health situation has therefore become more desperate than that in Botswana.

China provides a particularly striking example of how changes in health policy relevant to the organization of health systems (Fig. e1-8) can have rapid, far-reaching consequences for population health. Even as the 1982 Rockefeller conference was celebrating China's achievements in primary care, its health system was unraveling. The decision to open up the economy in the early 1980s led to rapid privatization of the health sector and the breakdown of universal health coverage. As a result, by the end of the 1980s, most people, especially the poorer segments of the population, were paying directly out of pocket for health care, and almost no Chinese had insurance¡ªa dramatic transformation. The "barefoot doctor" schemes collapsed, and the population either turned to care paid for at hospitals or simply became unable to access care. This undermining of access to primary care services in the Chinese system and the resulting increase in impoverishment due to illness contributed to the stagnation of progress in health in China at the same time that incomes in that country increased at an unprecedented rate. Reversals in primary care have meant that China now increasingly faces health care issues similar to those faced by India. In both countries, rapid economic growth has been linked to lifestyle changes and noncommunicable disease epidemics. The health care systems of the two nations share two negative features that are common when primary care is weak: a disproportionate focus on specialty services provided in hospitals and unregulated commercialization of health services. China and India have both seen expansion of private hospital services that cater to middle-class and urban populations who can afford care; at the same time, hundreds of millions of people in rural areas now struggle to access the most basic services. Even in the former groups, a lack of primary care services has been associated with late presentation with illness and with insufficient investment in primary prevention approaches. This neglect of prevention poses a risk of large-scale epidemics of cardiovascular disease, which could endanger continued economic growth. In addition, the health systems of both countries now depend for the majority of their funding on out-of-pocket payments by people when they use services. Thus substantial proportions of the population must sacrifice other essential goods as a result of health expenditure or are even driven into poverty by this cost. The commercial nature of health services with inadequate or no regulation has also led to the proliferation of charlatan providers, inappropriate care, and pressure for people to pay for expensive and sometimes unnecessary care. Commercial providers have limited incentives to use interventions (including public health measures) that cannot be charged for or that are limited to the person paying.

Faced with these problems, China and India have recently implemented measures to strengthen primary health care. China has increased government funding of health care, has taken steps toward restoring health insurance, and has enacted a target of universal access to primary care services. India has similarly mobilized funding to greatly expand primary care services in rural areas and is now duplicating this process in urban settings. Both countries are increasingly using public resources from their growing economies to fund primary care services. These encouraging trends are illustrative of new opportunities to implement a primary health care approach and strengthen primary care services in low- and middle-income countries.

Opportunities to Build Primary Care in Low- and Middle-Income Countries

Global public health targets will not be met unless health systems are significantly strengthened. More money is currently being spent on health than ever before. In 2005, global health spending totaled $5.1 trillion (U.S.)¡ªdouble the amount spent a decade earlier. Although most expenditure occurs in high-income countries, spending in many emerging middle-income countries has rapidly accelerated, as has the allocation of monies for this purpose by both governments in and donors to low-income countries. These twin trends¡ªgreater emphasis on building health systems based on primary care and allotment of more money for health care¡ªprovide opportunities to address many of the challenges discussed above in low- and middle-income countries.

Accelerating progress requires a better understanding of how global health initiatives can more effectively facilitate the development of primary care in low-income countries. A recent review by the WHO Maximizing Positive Synergies Collaborative Group looked at programs funded by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI); the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR); and the World Bank (on HIV/AIDS). This group found that global health initiatives had improved access to and quality of the targeted health services and had led to better information systems and more adequate financing. The review also identified the need for better alignment of global health initiatives with other national health priorities and systematic exploitation of potential synergies. If global health initiatives implement programs that work in tandem with other components of national health systems without undermining staffing and procurement of supplies, they have the potential to contribute substantially to the capacity of health systems to provide comprehensive primary care services.

Global health initiatives continue to draw increased funding. In 2009, for example, U.S. President Barack Obama announced increasing development assistance from the United States for global health, earmarking $63 billion over the period 2009¨C2014 for a Global Health Initiative. New funding is also promised through a range of other initiatives focusing particularly on maternal and child health in low-income countries. The general trend is to coordinate this funding to reduce fragmentation of national health systems and to concentrate more on strengthening these systems. Comprehensive primary care in low-income countries must inevitably deal with the rapid emergence of chronic diseases and the growing prominence of injury-related health problems; thus, international health development assistance must become more responsive to these needs.

Beyond the new streams of funding for health services, other opportunities exist. Increased social participation in health systems can help build primary care services. In many countries, political pressure from community advocates for more holistic and accountable care as well as entrepreneurial initiatives to scale up community-based services through NGOs have accelerated progress in primary care without major increases in funding. Participation of the population in the provision of health care services and in relevant decision making often drives services to cater to people's needs as a whole rather than to narrow public health priorities.

Participation and innovation can help address critical issues related to the health workforce in low- and middle-income countries by establishing effective people-centered primary care services. Many primary care services do not need to be delivered by a physician or a nurse. Multidisciplinary teams can include paid community workers who have access to a physician if necessary but who can provide a range of health services on their own. In Ethiopia, more than 30,000 community health workers have been trained and deployed to improve access to primary care services, and there is increasing evidence that this measure is contributing to better health outcomes. In India, more than 600,000 community health advocates have been recruited as part of expanded rural primary care services. After the Declaration of Alma Ata, experiences with community health workers were mixed, with particular problems about levels of training and lack of payment. Current endeavors are not immune from these concerns. However, with access to physician support and the deployment of teams, some of these concerns may be addressed. Growing evidence from many countries indicates that shifting appropriate tasks to primary care workers who have had shorter, less expensive training than physicians will be essential to address the human resources crisis.

Finally, recent improvements in information and communication technologies, particularly mobile phone and Internet systems, have created the potential to systematically implement e-health, telemedicine, and improved health data initiatives in low- and middle-income countries. These developments raise the tantalizing possibility that health systems in these countries, which have long lagged behind those in high-income countries but are less encumbered by legacy systems that have proved hard to modernize in many settings, could leapfrog their wealthier counterparts in exploiting these technologies. Although the challenges posed by poor or absent infrastructure and investment in many low- and middle-income countries cannot be underestimated and will need to be addressed to make this possibility a reality, the rapid rollout of mobile networks and their use for health and other social services in many low-income countries where access to fixed telephone lines was previously very limited offer great promise in building primary care services in low- and middle-income countries.
 
Conclusion

As concern continues to mount about glaring inequities in global health, there is a growing commitment to redress these egregious shortfalls, as exemplified by global mobilization around the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals. This commitment begins first and foremost with a clear vision of the fundamental importance of health in all countries, regardless of income. The values of health and health equity are shared across all borders, and primary health care provides a framework for their effective translation across all contexts.

The translation of these fundamental values has its roots in four types of reforms that reflect the distinct but interlinked challenges of (re-)orienting a society's resources on the basis of its citizens' health needs: (1) organizing health care services around the needs of people and communities; (2) harnessing services and sectors beyond health care to promote and protect health more effectively; (3) establishing sustainable and equitable financing mechanisms for universal coverage; and (4) investing in effective leadership of the whole of society. This common primary health care agenda highlights the striking similarity, despite enormous differences in context, in the nature and direction of the reforms that national health systems must undertake to promote greater equity in health. This shared agenda is complemented by the growing reality of global health interconnectedness due, for example, to shared microbial threats, bridging of ethnolinguistic diversity, flows in migrant health workers, and mobilization of global funds to support the neediest populations. Embracing solidarity in global health, while strengthening health systems using a primary health care approach, is fundamental to sustained progress in global health.

Background

Medicine, once the domain of solitary generalists and their nurse assistants, now engages scores of specialists and allied professionals¡ªradiation physicists, cytologists, nurse practitioners, psychiatric social workers, dental hygienists, and many more¡ªwho wield tools of unprecedented ability to extend life and sustain its quality. This evolution of the health care system has been achieved in part by a formidable enterprise of critical observation and formal investigation that disproves some accepted practices and stimulates the emergence of new approaches. One need only peruse the serial editions of this textbook to comprehend the scope of these changes.

Other factors also have affected evolutionary changes in medicine. The U.S. health care system has always been pluralistic, including many practices that are outside mainstream medicine. The public's expectations of health and the nature of the health care system have been altered by unprecedented access to sources of information, goods, and services; the disposable income to afford them; and a patchwork quilt of regulations and laws that constrain medical practice on the one hand and facilitate increased choice in health care on the other. Immigration and related demographic changes have created diverse communities that value their own health traditions. The emergence of complementary and alternative health practices and the approach called integrative medicine are manifestations of these changes in health care.
 
Definitions

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) refers to a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not considered part of conventional or allopathic medicine or that have historic origins outside mainstream medicine. Most of these practices are used together with conventional therapies and therefore have been called complementary to distinguish them from alternative practices, which are those used instead of standard care. Use of dietary supplements, mind-body practices such as hypnosis, and care from a traditional healer all fall under the umbrella of CAM. Although some CAM practices are directed by an alternative health care provider such as a chiropractor, acupuncturist, or naturopathic practitioner, much of CAM is undertaken as "self-care" and paid for out of pocket. CAM does not encompass practices that have not been translated fully from the laboratory to the clinic or practices that have been well studied and disproved but still have some public appeal. Rather, CAM entails approaches with surprising pervasiveness, many of which can claim at least some evidentiary support. Until a few years ago, CAM also could be defined as practices that are neither widely taught in medical schools nor reimbursed, but this definition is no longer useful, since medical students increasingly seek and receive some instruction about CAM and some CAM practices are reimbursed by third-party payers. Definitions of common CAM practices are provided in Table e2-1.

In the last decade, the term integrative medicine has entered this dialogue.

Integrative medicine refers to a style of practice that places strong emphasis on a holistic approach to patient care, focusing on preventive strategies for maintenance of health and reduced use of technology. Physicians advocating this approach generally include selected CAM practices, particularly mind-body practices and dietary supplements, in the care they offer patients, and some have established practice settings that include CAM practitioners. Although this approach appears to be attractive to many patients, the weaknesses in the evidence base for some of the interventions offered in integrative practices continue to attract substantial concern and controversy.
 
Patterns of Use

The first large survey of CAM use by Eisenberg and associates in 1993 surprised the medical community by showing that more than 30% of Americans use CAM approaches. Many studies since that time have extended those conclusions. Subsequently, the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a large national survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, a component of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has addressed the use of CAM and largely confirmed those results. The NHIS is a household survey of many kinds of health practices in the civilian population; it uses methods that create a nationally representative sample and has a sample size large enough to permit valid estimates about some subgroups. In 2002 and again in 2007, the survey included a set of questions that addressed CAM use. Information was obtained from 31,000 adults in 2002 and 23,300 adults and 9400 children in 2007. In both surveys, approximately 40% of adults were using some form of CAM. In the 2007 study, 38% of adults and 12% of children had used one or more modalities, with nonvitamin, nonmineral dietary supplements; relaxation techniques and meditation; chiropractic; and massage being the most prevalent. Over 1% reported having received acupuncture treatment. Americans are willing to pay for these services; the estimated out-of pocket expenditure for CAM in 2007 was $34 billion, representing 1.5% of total health expenditures and 11% of out-of pocket costs.

The appeal of unproven CAM approaches continues to surprise many physicians. Many factors contribute to these choices. Some patients seek out CAM practitioners because they offer optimism or greater personal attention. For others, alternative approaches reflect a "self-help" approach to health and wellness or satisfy a search for "natural" or less invasive alternatives, since dietary supplements and other natural products are believed, correctly or not, to be inherently healthier and safer than synthetic ones. In NHIS surveys, the most common health conditions cited by patients for CAM use involve management of symptoms often poorly controlled by conventional care, particularly back pain and other painful musculoskeletal complaints.
 
Fields of Practice and Licensure

At present, six fields of CAM practice¡ªosteopathic manipulation, chiropractic, acupuncture and traditional Asian medicine, massage therapy, naturopathy, and homeopathy¡ªare subject to licensure requirements and some form of educational accreditation. Mind-body practices such as meditation and yoga are not licensed in any state, and training in those practices is not subject to national accreditation.

Osteopathic Medicine

Founded in 1892 in the American heartland by the physician Andrew Taylor Still, osteopathic medicine was based originally on the belief that manipulation of soft tissue and bone can correct a wide range of diseases of the musculoskeletal and other organ systems. Over the ensuing century, osteopathy evolved progressively toward conventional (allopathic) medicine. Today, the training, practice, credentialing, licensure, and reimbursement of osteopathic physicians are virtually indistinguishable from those of allopathic physicians, with 4 years of osteopathic medical school followed by specialty and subspecialty training and certification by organizations such as the American Board of Internal Medicine. Some osteopathic physicians continue to practice spinal manipulation, primarily as a tool to address specific musculoskeletal complaints.

Chiropractic

In 1895, Daniel David Palmer founded in Missouri the first school of chiropractic medicine to teach manipulation of the spine. Palmer believed that subluxations, or partial dislocations of vertebrae, cause disease by impinging on key nerve roots. Today, chiropractors undertake 5 years of training in basic and relevant clinical sciences. Increasingly, they complete additional postgraduate training in radiology and outpatient therapeutics, primarily of musculoskeletal conditions, although within the discipline there are factions that continue to perform manipulation for many other pathologic entities. Chiropractors also advise on nutrition, exercise, and other health maintenance approaches. Over 50,000 doctors of chiropractic medicine are licensed to practice in the United States.

Acupuncture and Traditional Asian Medicine

A venerable component of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture emerged in recent decades as a free-standing clinical discipline. Over 3000 American physicians have acquired targeted postgraduate training that permits them to practice acupuncture in over 40 states and the District of Columbia. Over 4000 non-MDs have taken far more extended training that leads to licensure to practice independently or under the supervision of a physician.

Massage Therapy

Drawing on millennia of empirical knowledge, some 80 schools in the United States instruct students in an array of the soft tissue manipulative approaches that constitute massage. Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia license trainees to perform therapeutic massage.

Naturopathy

Fifteen states license practitioners of naturopathy, a discipline that emerged in central Europe in the late eighteenth century. The fact that conventional treatments of the day were usually ineffective, if not overtly harmful, stimulated the search for safer and more "natural" approaches¡ªnaturopathy is one of them. The concept underlying this discipline is that the body has powerful mechanisms for self-healing that a properly instructed practitioner can harness. About 1400 naturopathic physicians have completed 4 years of education in basic and clinical sciences and are licensed to manage a predominantly outpatient population. Conventional and unconventional diagnostic tests and medications are prescribed, with an emphasis on relatively low doses of drugs, herbal medicines, special diets, and exercises.

Homeopathy

The late eighteenth century also witnessed the emergence of homeopathy, another discipline that arose at least in part as a reaction to the toxicity inherent in many of the allopathic approaches of the day. Homeopathy was developed by Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician, who postulated that substances that cause particular side effects in a well person may be used to treat or prevent such symptoms in an ill person if administered in minuscule amounts¡ªwhat is known as "the doctrine of similars." For example, contact with poison ivy (Rhus toxicodendron) causes susceptible persons to experience an itchy, blistering rash. Homeopathy espouses the administration of highly diluted extracts of poison ivy to treat other blistering, pruritic eruptions, such as varicella. During the early nineteenth century, the then-nascent field of homeopathy used blinded tests on volunteers, presaging wider use of placebo-controlled trials, to "prove" which materials were the most able to induce or relieve symptoms. By the mid-nineteenth century homeopathy had gained considerable presence in the American medical establishment and may, in fact, have facilitated the development of immunization and allergen desensitization, both of which utilize very small quantities of materials to elicit measurable biologic outcomes. Today, however, homeopathy is accepted less fully in the United States than in some other countries. It is the largest of all CAM practices in the United Kingdom, Germany, and France and is widely used in India. In the United States, only three states currently license the practice of homeopathy. The relative decline of homeopathy relates, at least in part, to the field's inability to articulate a rational mechanism that explains why products that are diluted more than 1060-fold, greater than Avogadro's number, could incite biologic effects. Nonetheless, homeopathic remedies are readily available and commonly recommended by naturopathic physicians and other licensed and unlicensed practitioners.
 
Regulation of Dietary Supplements

Herbal medicines, and dietary supplements more generally, have a unique regulatory status that gives the public remarkable freedom of choice but also many undesired challenges. An element of traditional healing approaches, herbal medicines were presumed safe long before the implementation of drug regulations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In 1994, the U.S. Congress passed the Dietary Supplements Health and Education Act (DSHEA), which permits sale of dietary supplements "over the counter," as it were, but without the requirement imposed on manufacturers of prescription or conventional over-the-counter drugs to prove that their products are safe and effective before marketing. Supplements can be removed by the FDA from the market only if they are proved to be hazardous. Purveyors of dietary supplements cannot claim that they prevent or treat any disease. They can, however, claim that they maintain "normal structure and function" of body systems. For example, a product cannot claim to treat arthritis, but it can claim to maintain "normal joint health." Homeopathic products predate FDA drug regulations and are sold with no requirement that they be proved effective. Although homeopathic products are widely believed to be safe because they are highly dilute, one product, a nasal spray called Zicam, was withdrawn from the market when it was found to produce anosmia, probably because of a significant zinc content. Homeopathic products, and indeed other CAM products and practices, also convey the very significant risk that individuals will use them instead of effective conventional modalities.

Under the current regulatory framework, members of the public have considerable freedom to determine what is in their own best interest, even if those decisions deny them effective treatment; however, the courts have ruled that the rights of parents to withhold treatment of their children is limited in instances of life-threatening illnesses. Investigators have a broad ethical obligation not to withhold proven treatments for serious illnesses for the sake of testing unproven ones.
 
Safety

Risks imposed by the use of CAM approaches include injuries inflicted by a practice, inherent toxicities of the modality, and interference by the modality with more conventional treatments.

Injury

Physical and manipulative interventions can harm patients. In past decades, reused acupuncture needles transmitted hepatitis B virus infection; today, the standard of care requires disposable needles. Aggressive massage can cause soft tissue injuries. Spinal manipulation of patients with unrecognized vertebral lesions has been associated with cord injuries, and cervical manipulation has been associated with stroke. These appear to be rare events.

Inherent Toxicity

Although the public may believe that "natural" equates with "safe," it is abundantly clear that natural products can be toxic. Misidentification of medicinal mushrooms has led to liver failure. Contamination of tryptophan supplements caused the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Herbal products containing particular species of Aristolochia were associated with genitourinary malignancies. In 2001, extracts of kava, long used by Pacific Islanders for its mild anxiolytic and sedative properties, were associated with fulminant liver failure. A number of products, including the popular Ginkgo biloba, are known to prolong bleeding times and have been associated with postoperative hemorrhage. Among the most controversial dietary supplements is Ephedra sinica, or ma huang, a product used in traditional Chinese medicine for short-term treatment of asthma and bronchial congestion. The scientific basis for these indications was revealed when ephedra was shown to contain the ephedrine alkaloids, especially ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. With the promulgation of the DSHEA regulations, supplements containing ephedra and herbs rich in caffeine sold widely in the U.S. marketplace because of their claims to promote weight loss and enhance athletic performance. Reports of severe and fatal adverse events associated with use of ephedra-containing products led to an evidence-based review of the data surrounding them, and in 2004 the FDA banned their sale in the United States.

Adulteration

A major current concern with dietary supplements is adulteration with pharmacologic active compounds. Multi-ingredient products marketed for weight loss, body building, "sexual health," and athletic performance are of particular concern. Recent FDA recalls have involved adulteration with steroids, diuretics, stimulants, and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors.

Herb-Drug Interactions

The constituents of a few natural products are toxic; others are known to interfere with the metabolism of life-saving drugs. This effect was illustrated most compellingly with the demonstration in 2000 that consumption of St. John's wort interferes with the bioavailability of the HIVprotease inhibitor indinavir. Later studies showed its similar interference with metabolism of topoisomerase inhibitors such as irinotecan, with cyclosporine, and with many other drugs. The breadth of interference stems from the ability of hyperforin in St. John's wort to upregulate expression of the pregnane X receptor, a promiscuous nuclear regulatory factor that promotes the expression of many hepatic oxidative, conjugative, and efflux enzymes involved in drug and food metabolism.

Because of the large number of compounds that alter drug metabolism and the large number of agents some patients are taking, identification of all potential interactions can be a daunting task. Several useful Web resources can ameliorate this problem (Table e2-2). Clearly, attention to this problem is particularly important with drugs with a narrow therapeutic index, such as anticoagulants, antiseizure medications, immunosuppressants, and cancer chemotherapeutic agents.

The Evidence Base for CAM

Alternative health practices have evolved through an epistemologic framework completely different from that of contemporary biomedicine. Empirical observations of individual patients constitute the primary evidentiary base on which CAM practices are guided and taught. Nonetheless, over the last few decades, thousands of studies have been performed of various CAM approaches, including hundreds of trials involving herbs, acupuncture, and homeopathy. To date, very few CAM approaches have been proved definitively to be effective. Several factors contribute to this lack of convincing evidence. The vast majority of CAM studies have been seriously flawed by lack of appropriate controls, bias on the part of the investigators, small sample sizes, reliance on highly subjective and nonvalidated measures of benefit, and inappropriate statistical tests.

Methodologic Challenges

In addition, a series of methodologic issues challenge even the better-designed CAM studies. By and large, uniform practice guidelines do not exist, and the herbal products marketed in the United States are highly variable in quality and composition. Many CAM practices are not amenable to blinding. For example, both the patient and the practitioner would know if spinal manipulation had been performed, and conventional research paradigms cannot be used to test these approaches. These problems are not unique to CAM, as they also complicate attempts to study conventional practices such as psychotherapy and surgery.

Even with ongoing improvements in study design and conduct, issues of belief also stand in the way of comprehending and accepting the results of some CAM studies. Many physicians are reluctant to believe positive outcomes of clinical approaches that have not emerged through the classic experimental paradigm by which drugs and biologic agents are developed: the orderly progression from preclinical testing through serial phases of clinical trials. More important, it is difficult to accept results that are counterintuitive or the underlying mechanism of which defies rational explanation. As suggested above, an example of this dilemma involves studies of homeopathy. Some clinical trials of homeopathy for asthma, infantile diarrhea, and other common conditions reported positive results. Two systematic reviews of homeopathy trials reported an overall favorable impression of the clinical trials data, concluding that the treatments were more beneficial than placebo. Even the best trials and those reviews have been criticized on methodologic grounds. It remains unclear what evidence could compel a change in belief about the benefits of homeopathy when there are no cogent explanations for how substances diluted beyond the point at which only solute remains could exert physiologic effects.

Scientific Evidence and Public Acceptance

By contrast, although methodologic problems continue to plagueacupuncture trials, belief has been growing even in academic centers that acupuncture may be effective. The emerging acceptance of acupuncture results in part from its widespread availability and use in the United States today, even within the walls of major medical centers where it is used as an ancillary approach to pain management. Yet its acceptance appears to stem from more than just its communal appeal. Since the mid-1970s, biochemical and imaging studies have begun to yield evidence that needling can alter central pain-processing pathways, possibly by triggering release of neural mediators that bind to specific receptors in the brain regions that modulate pain perception.

Although it is difficult to conclude decisively that a particular CAM approach lacks any merit, it is quite feasible to discern that its effect size, or degree of benefit, is too small or inconsistent to be worth pursuing further. Over the last century, many once unconventional medical approaches failed¡ªone need only think back to the exotic electrical devices, procedures, and tonics that fell out of fashion. Two questions often are asked: (1) Do any of the more contemporary CAM modalities deserve to be rejected? (2) Would data showing them to be ineffective change anyone's mind about using them?

The case of laetrile is instructive. This extract of apricot seeds was touted in the 1970s as a cure for solid tumors. Thousands crossed the Mexican border to secure laetrile for their personal use. The lack of any positive preclinical data discouraged oncologists from agreeing to study laetrile until public pressure required that an answer be obtained. Two studies in the 1980s showed no benefit of laetrile treatment. Today, some continue to seek the product, but the numbers are vastly smaller than they were before meaningful data were obtained. A similar fate befell a cocktail of drugs used for cancer patients through the 1970s and 1980s by Dr. Luigi Di Bella in Italy once large studies revealed that it had no detectable impact on the course of a variety of advanced cancers.

In contrast, some modalities that have been well tested and found ineffective are still in fairly common use. For example, the renowned biochemist Linus Pauling proclaimed that vitamin C can treat and even prevent the common cold. Several high-quality studies failed to demonstrate clinically important effects of vitamin C in preventing or treating viral colds. Nonetheless, ingestion of extra vitamin C remains a common habit of individuals who perceive the onset of cold symptoms. For most people, this practice is wasteful but not harmful; however, people with iron overload (either hemochromatosis or chronic transfusion requirement) can be damaged by vitamin C, which generates free radicals in the setting of iron excess.

The Impact of Emerging Evidence

Nevertheless, emerging evidence on CAM approaches is having some impact on public practice. In the last decade the National Institutes of Health has sponsored a number of major randomized clinical trials of widely used dietary supplements. By and large, these studies have failed to confirm the benefits expected from the smaller studies that preceded them. Ginkgo biloba was not found to prevent cognitive decline or dementia. No clear-cut benefits of glucosamine for most patients with osteoarthritis of the knee could be demonstrated. Vitamin E and or selenium did not change the rates of development of prostate cancer. St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) did not have an impact on major depression. Although controversy exists about a number of these studies, they have received major media coverage; the research results have affected determinations by the FDA and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission about permitted marketing claims; and analysis by the supplement industry indicates that the research has had substantial effect on the sale of these compounds.
 
Information Sources

One of the difficult problems facing practicing physicians is providing patients with good advice and education about CAM practices. Irresponsible and misleading marketing claims abound, particularly on the Internet. Claims about antiaging regimens, enhancement of sexual function, weight loss, and increased athletic capacity are particularly common. A number of valuable Internet resources exist that provide good sources for patient education and can help counter some of this misinformation. Some particularly useful sites are summarized in Table e2-3.

In the last decade, it has become possible for scientists to perform the kind of rigorous systematic reviews of CAM that are the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine. A particularly valuable resource in this respect is the Cochrane Collaboration, which has performed more than 300 systematic reviews of CAM practices. Practitioners will find this a valuable resource to answer patient questions. By and large, most of these summaries do not conclude there is definite benefit; any beneficial effects that have been documented are modest but frequently are balanced by little indication of risk.
 
Summary

An array of unproven modalities will always be used by the patients under physicians' care. Physicians must approach each encounter as an opportunity to understand their patients' beliefs and expectations and use those insights to help guide their personal health care practices in a constructive way. Many of these choices are entirely innocuous and can be accommodated in the context of the established diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Some of these choices should be actively discouraged. Along the way, scientific evidence will drive many CAM approaches out of favor. Some modalities will garner sufficient support to become part of mainstream care and the next generation of physicians will never know they were once controversial.

The Economics of Medical Care: Introduction

This chapter attempts to explain to physicians how economists think about physicians and medical care. Economists' mode of thinking has shaped health care policy and institutions and thus the environment in which physicians practice. As a result, it may be useful for physicians to understand some aspects of this way of thinking even if at times it may seem foreign or uncongenial.

Physicians see themselves as professionals and as healers, assisting their patients with their health care needs. When economists are patients, they probably see physicians the same way, but when they view doctors through the lens of economics as a discipline, they see them as economic agents. In other words, economists are interested in the degree to which physicians respond to various incentives, both those that they face and those facing their patients, in deciding how to deploy the resources they control. Examples include how much of their own time to devote to seeing a patient; which tests to order; what drugs, if any, to prescribe; whether to recommend a procedure; whether to refer a patient; and whether to admit a patient.

This interest stems from fundamental economic questions: What goods and services are produced and consumed? In particular, how much medical care is available, and how much of other goods and services? How is that medical care produced? For example, what mix of specific services is used to treat a particular episode of illness? Who receives particular treatments?

Physicians in all societies live and function in economic markets, although those markets differ greatly from the simple competitive markets depicted in introductory economic textbooks and also differ from country to country, depending on an individual country's institutions. Many of the differences between actual medical markets and textbook competitive markets cause what economists term market failure, a condition in which some individuals can be made better off without making anyone else worse off.

This chapter explains two features of health care financing that cause market failure: selection and moral hazard. A common response to market failure in medical care is what economists term administered prices, which is another concept this chapter describes. Administered prices also exact an economic cost, leading to what economists call regulatory failure. All developed societies seek a balance between market failure and regulatory failure, a topic addressed in this chapter's conclusion.

Selection

In the idealized competitive market found in economic textbooks, buyers and sellers know the same amount about the good or service they are buying and selling. When one party knows more¡ªor when goods of different quality are being sold at the same price, which is analytically similar¡ªmarkets can break down in the following sense: There may be a price at which an equally well informed buyer and seller could make a transaction that would make them both better off, but the transaction does not occur because one party knows more than the other. Hence, both the potential buyer and the potential seller are worse off.

The used car market is a classic example of differential information. Owners of used cars (potential sellers) know more about the quality of their cars than do potential buyers. At any specific price for a certain make and model of car, the only used cars offered will be those whose sellers value them at less than that price. Such cars will differentially be of low quality ("lemons") relative to the given price; in fact, assuming a continuum of quality, the average cars offered will be those which are valued at or less than the price in the market. However, that means that any potential buyer, lacking information about the quality of a car, would potentially pay (much) more than that car is worth. Because buyers know that the sellers know more about the quality of the car, transactions that would occur if a buyer and seller had equally good information about the quality of the car may not occur. (It is for this reason that sellers may offer warranties and guarantees.)

The same thing happens when goods of different quality are sold at the supermarket at the same price. Shoppers are happy to take quickly any box of a particular brand of breakfast cereal or bottle of soft drink on the shelf because the quality of any box or bottle is the same, but they will take their time inspecting produce to make sure that the apple they pick up and put in the cart is not bruised or the banana is not overly ripe. At the end of the day, it is the bruised apples and overly ripe bananas that are left in the store. In effect, the seller has not used all the information in pricing the produce, and buyers exploit that information differential.

Selection affects markets for individual and, to some degree, small group health insurance in a fashion similar to the used car market and the produce stand, but in this case it is the buyer of insurance who has more knowledge than the seller. Individuals who use above-average amounts of care¡ªfor example those with a chronic disease or a strong proclivity to seek care for a symptom¡ªwill value health insurance more than will those who are healthy or who for various reasons shun medical care even if they are symptomatic. However, the insurer does not necessarily know the risk of those it insures, and so it gears insurance premiums to an average risk or sometimes an average risk conditional on certain observable characteristics, such as age. Just as shoppers do not want the bruised apples and used car buyers do not want lemons, many healthy people will not want to buy insurance voluntarily if its price mainly reflects the use of those who are sick. (Healthy but very risk averse individuals still may be willing to pay premiums well above their expected use.) In an extreme case, healthy people drop out of the insurance pool, premiums rise (the average person left in the pool is sicker), and that rise causes still more people to drop out of the pool, causing premiums to rise further, and so forth, until few people are left buying insurance.

For this reason, no developed country relies primarily on voluntary individual insurance to finance health care, although many countries use it in the supplemental insurance market, and selection is often a feature of that market. Instead, governments and/or employers provide or heavily subsidize the purchase of either mandated or voluntary health insurance (e.g., the American Medicare and Medicaid programs, Canada, Germany, the state of Massachusetts) or provide health services directly (e.g., the United Kingdom, the United States Veterans Health Administration, and the Indian Health Service).

Moreover, countries that rely on employment-based health insurance, such as the United States and Germany, either mandate taxes to finance that insurance or provide large tax subsidies for its purchase; otherwise, many healthy employees would prefer that the employer give them the money the employer pays toward the insurance in the form of cash wages. Because an employer who offers health insurance will pay lower cash wages than an otherwise equivalent employer that does not, many American employers, who are not required to offer insurance, may not do so in low-wage industries; if they did, the cash wage they could afford to pay could be below the minimum wage. (Nor, typically, do they offer a pension benefit for the same reason.) These low-wage employers are often, but not always, small businesses. Whereas 18% of the American labor force worked in firms with 3 to 24 employees in 2008, only 13.8% of workers with health insurance were employed in those firms. Some self-employed individuals or those who work at small firms may belong to a trade association or a professional society through which they can purchase insurance (including some physicians), but because that purchase is voluntary, it is subject to selection. Those who do not have access to such insurance must use the individual insurance market.

How does this affect the practice of medicine? Individual and small group insurance policies typically have preexisting condition clauses that protect the insurer against selection, that is, provide protection against a person's purchasing insurance (or more complete insurance) after that person has been diagnosed with a disease that is expensive to treat. Even so, elements of selection remain in the individual insurance market, and thus premiums tend to be high. As a result, Americans who are not eligible for employer-subsidized insurance or who cannot obtain such insurance through a spouse may not voluntarily purchase insurance, yet many of those persons will seek care even without insurance. Caring for such "self-pay" patients may give the physician a choice between making do with a less than clinically optimal treatment and proceeding in a clinically optimal way but leaving the patient with a large bill and possible bankruptcy (and leaving the physician with bill collection issues or unpaid bills). Those who do purchase insurance at high premiums may buy a bare bones policy or a policy that covers only a few physician visits and some drugs, again leaving the physician the problem of determining a realistic treatment plan that the patient can afford.

Selection can arise in a different guise when physicians are reimbursed a fixed amount per patient (i.e., capitation) rather than receiving fee-for-service payments. Depending on the adequacy of any adjustments in the capitated amount for the resources that a specific patient will require¡ªfrequently, there are no such adjustments¡ªphysicians who receive a fixed amount have a financial incentive to avoid caring for sicker patients. Similarly, physicians who receive a capitated amount for their own services but are not financially responsible for the services of other physicians may make an excessive number of referrals, just as a physician reimbursed in a fee-for-service arrangement may make too few.

Moral Hazard

The term moral hazard comes from the actuarial literature; it originally referred to the weaker incentives of an insured individual to prevent the loss against which he or she is being insured. A classic example is failure of homeowners in areas prone to brush fires to cut brush around their houses or possibly install fire-resistant shingles on their roofs because of their expectation that insurance will compensate them if their houses burn down. In some lines of insurance, however, moral hazard is not a large issue. Persons who buy life insurance on their own lives are not likely to commit suicide so that the policy will pay off. (Because of moral hazard, however, the law prohibits buying life insurance on another person with whom one does not have a relationship or a substantial economic interest.) Also, despite the brush fire example, homeowners insurance probably has little moral hazard associated with it because individuals often cannot replace lost belongings such as a photo album when a house burns down or property that is destroyed when there is a burglary. In short, if moral hazard is negligible, insured persons take appropriate precautions against the potential loss.

In the context of health insurance, this classic form of moral hazard means potentially reduced incentives to prevent illness and is probably not a large issue. Sickness and disease generally imply some pain and suffering, not to mention possibly shortened life expectancy. Because there is no insurance for the pain and suffering, individuals have strong incentives to try to remain healthy regardless of how much health insurance they have. Put another way, having better health insurance probably does not strengthen those incentives much.

Instead of weakened incentives to prevent illness, in the health insurance context, moral hazard typically refers to the incentives for better-insured individuals to use more medical services. For instance, a patient with back pain or shoulder pain might request an expensive imaging test such as an MRI if it is free or of low cost to him or her even if the physician feels the clinical value of the test is negligible. Conversely, the physician may be more cautious in ordering a test that seems likely to produce little information if there are severe financial consequences for the patient.

The strongest evidence on this point comes from a randomized experiment done in the late 1970s and early 1980s: the RAND Health Insurance Experiment. Families whose members were <65 years of age were randomized to insurance plans in which the amount they had to pay when using services ("cost sharing") varied from nothing (fully insured care) to a large deductible (catastrophic insurance). All the plans capped families' annual out-of-pocket payments, with a reduced cap for low-income families. Families with complete insurance used about 40% more services in a year than did families with catastrophic insurance, a figure that did not vary much across the six geographically dispersed sites in which the experiment was run. Although these data come from the era before managed care in the United States, subsequent observational studies in the United States and elsewhere have largely confirmed its findings with respect to the relationship between variations in care use and variations in patient payment at the point of service.

Those in the RAND experiment for whom medical care was free were more likely to seek care for problems for which care could be efficacious. One would assume that this would have resulted in improved outcomes, but by and large it did not. In fact, there was little or no difference in average health outcomes among those on different health plans with the important exception that people with hypertension, especially those with low incomes, were better controlled when care was free. Moreover, those in the experiment for whom medical care was free were also more likely to seek care for problems for which care was not likely to be useful.

A possible explanation for the paucity of beneficial effects from the additional medical services those on the free plan used is that the population in the experiment, which consisted of nonelderly community-dwelling individuals, was mostly healthy. Those with a large deductible made about two physician visits each year on average; those whose care was free made about twice that number and were hospitalized roughly 25% more often. It is possible that the additional two visits and the greater number of hospitalizations were as likely to lead to poor outcomes as good outcomes in that population. Certainly, the subsequent literature on quality of care and medical error rates implies that a good deal of inappropriate care was¡ªand is¡ªprovided to patients. For example, over half the antibiotics prescribed to the experiment's participants were for viral conditions. Moreover, about a quarter of those hospitalized (in all plans) were admitted for procedures that could have been done equally well outside the hospital, consistent with the large fall in hospital use over the last three decades. In short, the additional inappropriate care when care was free was not necessarily innocuous; if a mainly healthy person saw a physician, he or she could have been made worse off. The literature on inappropriate care is mostly American in origin, but the finding probably holds elsewhere as well.

Insurance is certainly desirable to protect families against the financial risk of large medical expenses and in some instances to address underuse of valuable services, such as a patient with diabetes or hypertension failing to take medications for financial reasons. Thus, the remedy for moral hazard is not to abolish insurance but instead to strike the right balance between financial protection and incentives to seek care. Moreover, it is probably useful to vary the amounts patients pay out of pocket depending on the specific service and the patient's clinical condition. It may be better, for example, to have small or no copayments for antidiabetics or antihypertensives or statin drugs for patients who have had a myocardial infarction and have higher copayments for drugs whose use is more discretionary.

Administered Prices

Because insurers, whether public or private, cannot pay any price a physician sets, prices in medical markets with widespread insurance are either set administratively or negotiated. In the simple textbook model, competitive market prices approximate the cost of production, but this does not necessarily happen when prices are administered. In the American Medicare program, for example, the government sets a take-it-or-leave-it price. Because of the market share represented by the Medicare program, virtually all physicians choose to take the government's price rather than leave the program. In some countries (e.g., Canada and Germany), medical societies negotiate fees for all physicians in the nation or in a subnational area. In the United States, commercial insurers negotiate fees with individual physicians or physician groups.

The principal problem with administered prices is that someone must set them. If the price that is set departs markedly from incremental cost, distortions inevitably result; the price setter typically has very little information about incremental cost, and so the price could be (and often is) far from the cost. If the regulator sets the price below cost, the service may not be available, or if it is, it will have to be cross-subsidized from a profitable service. If the price is set above cost, there may well be excess entry and too many services being offered on too small a scale. Moreover, cost probably varies across physicians and hospitals, meaning that a single price will not fit all. A beneficent regulator in theory could approximate an equilibrium price and the cost of production by trial and error if technology did not change, but clearly, that condition does not hold in medical care. Not only do new goods and services appear continually, physicians often become more skilled at delivering a service that already is available or developing new tools to deliver that service at a different and frequently lower cost. For example, cataract surgery, which took upward of 8 hours when first introduced, can now be completed in <30 minutes.

The distortions between price and cost when prices are administered have consequences for the way medical care is produced. There may well be too much capacity in "profitable" areas of medicine, such as cardiac services and sports medicine, and too little in less profitable areas, such as primary care. A fee above cost for a procedure encourages more procedures.

Conversely, payment methods that attempt to pay for many services with one fixed payment, such as capitation and a per-admission payment, pay nothing for doing more and therefore may result in too few services or in selection by providers to reduce the number of unprofitable patients under their care, much as a hospital may shutter an emergency room if it becomes a magnet for the uninsured. As was noted above, these phenomena also reflect the asymmetry of information between patients and physicians and, in the case of fee-for-service payment, the incentive for insured patients to go along with a recommendation for additional services ("I am pretty sure I know what the problem is, but let's just carry out this additional test to be sure").

There is good evidence that physicians as a group respond to the prices that are set. For example, if there is a general reduction in fees that, other things equal, would lower practice income, physicians order more services; conversely, they do the opposite if there is an increase in fees. This behavior is sufficiently well established empirically that the U.S. Medicare program's actuaries account for it in their cost estimates of what various changes in fees will cost or save.

Negotiated prices may get closer to cost than administered prices that are set, but they are not a panacea. First, the relevant cost for patients is the total cost of treating the entire medical problem and the outcome obtained, both of which probably are not reflected in the negotiated physician's fee. Second, in the United States, commercial insurers often negotiate fees as a multiple of the Medicare fee schedule, and so any distortion in the administratively determined relative fees is carried over into the negotiated fees. For example, in the Medicare fee schedule, procedures generally are more profitable than cognitive services known as "evaluation and management," and this probably plays a role in the United States having too few primary care physicians. Third, both in the United States and elsewhere, the negotiation may be for a large number of physicians who have different costs, in which case fees will depart from costs for some or all the physicians in the group. Fourth, negotiated prices may well exceed cost when there is no effective competition among similar physicians in a particular market. Because medical care markets are typically local, there may only be one group in any particular specialty in a smaller market, in which case that group will have considerable market power to obtain more favorable reimbursement. Related to this point, physicians may seek to negotiate together to increase their market power. Finally, many, probably most, patients are reluctant to change physicians because their current physician knows their medical history and because they are uncertain whether a new physician would be an improvement and also because insurance shields them from most of the cost differences among physicians.

Conclusion

One branch of economics¡ªpositive economics¡ªseeks to explain actual phenomena without making a judgment about the desirability of those phenomena. Another branch¡ªnormative economics¡ªseeks to prescribe what should happen and, in particular, what public policy should be to ensure that it happens. Its main result is that under certain very special assumptions, competitive markets will lead to a result in which no one can be made better off without another person being made worse off. These assumptions do not hold in medical care, in part because of selection and moral hazard; economists term the result a market failure. By contrast, even a beneficent regulator will introduce distortions from lack of sufficient information, as the discussion of administered prices in this chapter indicated, and there is no guarantee that a regulator will be beneficent, as periodic corruption scandals indicate. Economists term this phenomenon regulatory or government failure. Economists see decisions about the proper form and amount of public intervention and regulation in medical care as a matter of finding the right balance between various types of market failures and various types of regulatory failures, a balance that different societies may choose to strike differently.

Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care: Introduction

Over the course of its history, the United States has experienced dramatic improvements in overall health and life expectancy due largely to initiatives in public health, health promotion, disease prevention, and chronic care management. Our ability to prevent, detect, and treat diseases in their early stages has allowed us to target and reduce morbidity and mortality. Despite interventions that have improved the overall health of the majority of Americans, racial and ethnic minorities (blacks, Hispanics/Latinos, Native Americans/Alaskan Natives, Asian/Pacific Islanders) have benefited less from these advances and suffer poorer health outcomes than whites from many major diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes) in the United States. Research has highlighted that minorities may receive less care and lower quality care than whites, even when confounders such as stage of presentation, comorbidities, and health insurance are controlled. These differences in quality are called racial and ethnic disparities in health care. This chapter will provide an overview of racial and ethnic disparities in health and health care, identify root causes, and provide key recommendations to address them at both the clinical and health system levels.

Nature and Extent of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health and Health Care

Minority Americans have poorer health outcomes (compared with whites) from preventable and treatable conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma, cancer, and HIV/AIDS, among others (Fig. e4-1). Multiple factors contribute to these racial and ethnic disparities in health. First and foremost, there is little doubt that social determinants¡ªsuch as lower levels of education, lower socioeconomic status, inadequate and unsafe housing, racism, and living in close proximity to environmental hazards¡ªdisproportionately impact minority populations and thus contribute to poorer health outcomes. For example, three of the five largest landfills in the country are found in black and Latino communities; these environmental hazards have contributed to some of the highest rates of pediatric asthma among these populations. Second, lack of access to care also takes a significant toll, as uninsured individuals are less likely to have a regular source of care, and are more likely to delay seeking care and go without needed care¡ªall resulting in avoidable hospitalizations, emergency hospital care, and adverse health outcomes.

In addition to the existence of racial and ethnic disparities in health, there are racial/ethnic disparities in the quality of care for those with access to the health care system. For instance, disparities have been found in the treatment of pneumonia (Fig. e4-2) and congestive heart failure (blacks receiving less optimal care than whites when hospitalized for these conditions) and referral to renal transplantation (blacks with end-stage renal disease being referred less often to the transplant list than whites) (Fig. e4-3). Disparities have also been found in the utilization of cardiac diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (blacks being referred less often than whites for cardiac catheterization and bypass grafting), prescription of analgesia for pain control (blacks and Latinos receiving less pain medication than whites for long bone fractures and cancer), and surgical treatment of lung cancer (blacks receiving less curative surgery than whites for non-small-cell lung cancer), among others. Again, many of these disparities occurred even when variations in factors such as insurance status, income, age, comorbid conditions, and symptom expression are taken into account.

Reference population is 239 black women, 280 white women, 271 black men, and 271 white men. Racial differences were statistically significant among the women and the men (p<.0001 for each comparison). (From JZ Ayanian et al: N Engl J Med 341:1661, 1999.)



Little progress has been made in addressing racial/ethnic disparities in cardiovascular procedures and other advanced surgical procedures, while some progress has been made in eliminating disparities in primary care process measures. Data from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction found evidence of continued disparities in guideline-based admission, procedural, and discharge therapy use from 1994 to 2006. Compared to whites, black patients were less likely to receive percutaneous coronary intervention/coronary artery bypass grafting (PCI/CABG), a disparity that has shown little improvement since 1994. Further, compared to whites, black patients were less likely to receive lipid-lowering medications at discharge, with a gap that has widened since 1998 (Fig. e4-4). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analyzed national and state rates of total knee replacement (TKR) for Medicare enrollees for the period 2000 to 2006, stratified by sex, age group, and black or white race. TKR rates overall in the United States increased 58%, with similar increases among whites (61%) and blacks (56%). However, the TKR rate for blacks was 37% lower than the rate for whites in 2000 and 39% lower in 2006¡ªno improvement and even a slight worsening of the disparity (Fig. e4-5). Using data from enrollees in Medicare managed care plans, there is evidence for a narrowing in racial disparities between 1997 and 2003 in several "report card" preventive care measures such as mammography and glucose and cholesterol testing. However, racial disparities in more complex items such as glucose control in diabetics and cholesterol levels in patients after a heart attack had actually worsened.

The sixth National Healthcare Disparities Report (NHDR), released by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in January 2008, found that disparities in core measures of quality have improved little between 2001 and 2006. The report shows that for blacks, Asians, Native Americans/Alaskan Natives, Hispanics, and poor people, 60¨C80% of core quality measures, including measures of effectiveness, patient safety, and timeliness of care either stayed the same or worsened. While a smaller number of these measures have improved, in none of the measured areas have disparities been eliminated.

Root Causes for Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Health Care

The Institute of Medicine (IOM) report Unequal Treatment, released in March 2002, remains the preeminent study of the issue of racial and ethnic disparities in health care in the United States. The IOM was charged to assess the extent of racial/ethnic differences in health care that are not otherwise attributable to known factors such as access to care. To provide recommendations regarding interventions to eliminate health care disparities, the IOM studied health system, provider, and patient factors. The report found the following:

Racial and ethnic disparities in health care exist and, because they are associated with worse health outcomes, are unacceptable.
Racial and ethnic disparities in health care occur in the context of (1) broader historic and contemporary social and economic inequality and (2) evidence of persistent racial and ethnic discrimination in many sectors of American life.
Many sources¡ªincluding health systems, health care providers, patients, and utilization managers¡ªmay contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in health care.
Bias, stereotyping, prejudice, and clinical uncertainty on the part of health care providers may contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in health care.
A small number of studies suggest that certain patients may be more likely to refuse treatments, yet these refusal rates are generally small and do not fully explain health care disparities.
Unequal Treatment went on to identify a set of root causes that included the following, among others:

Health system factors: These include issues related to the complexity of the health care system, the difficulty that minority patients may have in navigating this complex health system, and the lack of availability of interpreter services to assist patients with limited English proficiency. In addition, health care systems are generally ill-prepared to identify and address disparities.
Provider-level factors: These include issues related to the health care provider, including stereotyping, the impact of race/ethnicity on clinical decision making, and clinical uncertainty due to poor communication.
Patient-level factors: These include patient's refusal of services, poor adherence to treatment, and delay in seeking care.
A more detailed analysis of these root causes is presented here.

Health System Factors

Health System Complexity

Even among those who are insured and educated, and who have a high degree of health literacy, navigating the health care system can be complicated and confusing. Some individuals, however, may be at higher risk for receiving substandard care because of their difficulty navigating the complexities of the U.S. health care system. These individuals may include those from cultures unfamiliar with the Western model of health care delivery, those with limited English proficiency, those with low health literacy, and those who are mistrustful of the health care system. These individuals may have difficulty knowing how and where to go for a referral to a specialist; how to prepare for a procedure such as a colonoscopy; or how to follow up on an abnormal test result such as a mammogram, for example. Since people of color in the United States tend to be overrepresented among the groups listed above, the inherent complexity of navigating our health care system has been seen as a root cause for racial/ethnic disparities in health care.

Other Health System Factors

Racial/ethnic disparities are due not only to differences in care provided within hospitals, but also result from where and from whom minorities receive their care (i.e., specific providers, geographic regions, or hospitals that are lower-performing on certain aspects of quality).

For example, one study showed that 25% of hospitals cared for 90% of black Medicare patients in the United States and these hospitals tended to have lower performance scores on certain quality measures than other hospitals. This being said, health systems are generally not well prepared to measure, report, and intervene to reduce disparities in care. Few hospitals or health plans stratify their quality data by race/ethnicity or language to measure disparities, and even fewer use data of this type to develop disparities-targeted interventions.

Provider-Level Factors

Provider-Patient Communication

Significant evidence highlights the impact of sociocultural factors, race, ethnicity, and limited English proficiency on health and clinical care. Health care professionals frequently care for diverse patient populations who present varied perspectives, values, beliefs, and behaviors regarding health and well-being. These include variations in recognition of symptoms, thresholds for seeking care, comprehension of management strategies, expectations of care (including preferences for or against diagnostic and therapeutic procedures), and adherence to preventive measures and medications. In addition, sociocultural differences between patient and provider influence communication and clinical decision making and are especially pertinent given evidence that clearly links provider-patient communication to improved patient satisfaction, adherence, and, subsequently, better health outcomes (Fig. e4-6). Thus, when sociocultural differences between patient and provider are not appreciated, explored, understood, or communicated effectively in the medical encounter, patient dissatisfaction, poor adherence, poorer health outcomes, and racial/ethnic disparities in care may result.

Figure e4-6


The link between effective communication, patient satisfaction, adherence, and health outcomes.(From Institute of Medicine: Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care. Washington, DC, National Academy Press, 2002.)


A survey of 6722 Americans age 18 and older is particularly relevant given the important link between provider-patient communication and health outcomes. Whites, blacks, Hispanics/Latinos, and Asian Americans who had a medical visit in the past 2 years were asked whether they had trouble understanding their doctors; whether they felt the doctors did not listen; and whether they had medical questions they were afraid to ask. The survey found that 19% of all patients experienced one or more of these problems, yet whites experienced them 16% of the time, compared with 23% of the time for blacks, 33% for Hispanics/Latinos, and 27% for Asian Americans (Fig. e4-7).

Figure e4-7


Communication difficulties with physicians, by race/ethnicity. Reference population is 6722 Americans age 18 and older who had a medical visit in the last 2 years and were asked whether they had trouble understanding their doctors, whether they felt the doctors did not listen, and whether they had medical questions they were afraid to ask. (From Commonwealth Fund Health Care Quality Survey, 2001.)

In addition, provider-patient communication without an interpreter, in the setting of even a minimal language barrier, is recognized as a major challenge to effective health care delivery. Spanish-speaking patients discharged from the emergency room are less likely than their English-speaking counterparts to understand their diagnosis, prescribed medications, special instructions, and plans for follow-up care; less likely to be satisfied with their care or willing to return if they have a problem; more likely to report problems with their care; and less satisfied with the patient-provider relationship. In addition, physicians who have access to trained interpreters report a significantly higher quality of patient-physician communication than physicians who used other methods. Hispanic patients with language-discordant physicians are more likely to omit medication, miss office appointments, and visit the emergency department for care. Communication issues related to discordant language disproportionately affect minorities and others with limited English proficiency and likely contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in health care.

Clinical Decision Making

Theory and research suggest that variations in clinical decision making may contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in health care. Two factors are central to this process: clinical uncertainty and stereotyping.

First, a doctor's decision-making process is nested in clinical uncertainty. Doctors depend on inferences about severity based on what they understand about illness and the information obtained from the patient. If the doctor is caring for a patient for whom he or she has difficulty understanding the symptoms and is less sure of the "signal"¡ªthe set of clues and indications that physicians rely on to make clinical decisions¡ªthe decision may be different than for another patient who presents with the exact same clinical condition. Given that the expression of symptoms may differ among and between cultural and racial groups, doctors¡ªthe overwhelming majority of whom are white¡ªmay understand symptoms best from patients of their own racial/ethnic groups. The consequence is that white patients may be treated differently from minority patients. Differences in clinical decisions from this mechanism can arise even when the doctor has the same regard for each patient (i.e., no prejudice).

Second, the literature on social cognitive theory highlights how natural tendencies to stereotype may influence clinical decision making. Stereotyping can be defined as the process by which people use social categories (e.g., race, gender, age) in acquiring, processing, and recalling information about others. Faced with enormous information loads and the need to make many decisions, people frequently subconsciously simplify the decision-making process and lessen cognitive effort by using "categories" or "stereotypes" that bundle information into groups or types that can be more quickly processed. Although functional, stereotyping can be systematically biased as people are automatically classified into social categories relating to dimensions such as race, gender, and age. Interestingly, people may not be aware of their attitudes, may not consciously endorse specific stereotypes, and paradoxically may consider themselves egalitarian and not prejudiced.

Stereotypes may be strongly influenced by the messages presented consciously and subconsciously in society. For instance, if the media and our social/professional contacts tend to present images of minorities as being less educated, violent, and non-adherent to health care recommendations, these impressions may generate stereotypes that unnaturally and unjustly impact clinical decision making. Thus, as signs of racism, classism, gender bias, and ageism are experienced¡ªconsciously or unconsciously in our society¡ªstereotypes may be created that impact the way doctors manage patients from these groups. Based on training or practice location, doctors may develop certain perceptions about race/ethnicity, culture, and class that may evolve into stereotypes. For example, many medical students and residents are often trained¡ªand minorities cared for¡ªin academic health centers or public hospitals located in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas. As a result, doctors may begin to equate certain races and ethnicities with specific health beliefs and behaviors (e.g., "these patients" engage in risky behaviors, or "those patients" tend to be noncompliant) that are more associated with the social environment (e.g., poverty) than a patient's racial/ethnic background or cultural traditions. This "conditioning" phenomenon may also occur if doctors are faced with certain racial/ethnic patient groups who don't frequently choose aggressive forms of diagnostic or therapeutic interventions. The result over time may be that doctors begin to believe that "these patients" don't like invasive procedures, and thus they may not offer them as options. A wide range of studies have documented the potential for provider biases to contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in health care. For example, one study measured physicians' unconscious (or implicit) biases and showed that these were related to differences in decisions to provide thrombolysis for a hypothetical black or white patient with a myocardial infarction. (See Green in "Further Readings.")

To further compound this issue, doctors are commonly taught that their own personal characteristics (race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status), the personal characteristics of the patient, and the clinical setting, should be excluded in the formulation of clinical decisions. Many nonmedical factors, however, ranging from the patient's physical appearance and background (race/ethnicity, gender, age, socioeconomic status, insurance status) to the doctor's background (specialty, level of training, clinical experience, age, gender, race/ethnicity) to the organizational setting in which medical care is delivered (location, form of compensation, performance expectations, incentives), may have as much influence on clinical decisions as the actual signs and symptoms of disease.

It is important to differentiate stereotyping from prejudice and discrimination. Prejudice is a conscious prejudgment of individuals that may lead to disparate treatment, and discrimination is conscious and intentional disparate treatment. All individuals stereotype subconsciously, yet if left unchecked, this may lead to lower quality of care for certain groups¡ªsuch as minorities¡ªwho may be deemed less worthy of diagnostic or therapeutic procedures or resources. What is particularly salient is that stereotypes tend to be activated most in environments where the individual is stressed, multitasking, and under the time pressure¡ªthe hallmarks of the clinical encounter.

Patient-Level Factors

Mistrust

Lack of trust has become a major concern for many health care institutions today. For example, an Institute of Medicine Report, To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System, documented alarming rates of medical errors and made patients feel vulnerable and less trustful of the U.S. health care system. The increased media and academic attention to problems of quality of care (and even disparities themselves) have clearly diminished trust in doctors and nurses.

Trust is a crucial element in the therapeutic alliance between patient and health care provider. It facilitates open communication and is directly correlated with adherence to physician recommendations and patient satisfaction. Patients who mistrust their health care providers are less satisfied with the care they receive, and mistrust of the health care system greatly affects patients' use of services. It can also result in inconsistent care, doctor-shopping, self-medicating, and an increased demand for referrals and diagnostic tests by patients.

Based on historic factors of discrimination, segregation, and medical experimentation, Black may be especially mistrustful of providers. The exploitation of blacks by the U.S. Public Health Service during the Tuskegee syphilis study from 1932 to 1972 left a legacy of mistrust that persists even today among this population. Other populations including Native Americans/Alaskan Natives, Hispanics/Latinos, and Asian Americans also harbor significant mistrust of the health care system. A national Kaiser Family Foundation survey of 3884 individuals found that 36% of Hispanics and 35% of black (compared with 15% of whites) felt they were treated unfairly in the health care system in the past based on their race and ethnicity. Perhaps even more alarming, 65% of blacks and 58% of Hispanics (compared with 22% of whites) were afraid of being treated unfairly in the future based on their race/ethnicity (Fig. e4-8).

(From Race, Ethnicity & Medical Care: A Survey of Public Perceptions and Experiences. Kaiser Family Foundation, 2005.)

This mistrust may contribute to wariness in accepting or following recommendations, undergoing invasive procedures, or participating in clinical research, which may lead to misunderstanding and stereotypes by health professionals.

Key Recommendations to Address Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Health Care

The publication Unequal Treatment provides a series of recommendations to address racial and ethnic disparities in health care, focusing on a broad set of stakeholders. These include health systems interventions, provider interventions, patient interventions, and general recommendations, described in more detail below.

Health System Interventions

Collect and report health care access and utilization data by patient's race/ethnicity

Unequal Treatment found that the appropriate systems to track and monitor racial and ethnic disparities in health care are lacking, and there is less known about the disparities for minority groups (Hispanics, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, and Alaskan Natives) other than African Americans. For instance, only in the mid-1980s did the Medicare database begin to collect data on patient groups outside the standard categories of "white," "black," and "other." Federal, private, and state-supported data collection efforts are scattered and unsystematic, and many health care systems and hospitals still do not collect data on the race, ethnicity, or primary language of patients or enrollees. A survey of 501 U.S. hospitals by Regenstein and Sickler in 2006 found that 78% collected race information, 50% collected data on patient ethnicity, and 50% collected data on primary language. However, the information was not collected using standard categories or collection methods, so it is difficult to assess the accuracy of the data. Surveys by America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) in 2003 and 2006 showed the number of enrollees who were in plans that collected race/ethnicity data of some type increased from 54 to 67%.

Encourage the use of evidence-based guidelines and quality improvement

Unequal Treatment highlights the subjectivity of clinical decision making as a potential cause of racial and ethnic disparities in health care by describing how clinicians may offer different diagnostic and treatment options to different patients (consciously and unconsciously) based on their race or ethnicity, despite the existence of well-delineated practice guidelines. Therefore, the adoption and implementation of evidence-based guidelines broadly is a major recommendation to eliminate disparities. For instance, there now exist evidence-based guidelines for the management of diabetes, HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular diseases, cancer screening and management, and asthma¡ªall areas where significant disparities exist. As part of ongoing quality improvement efforts, particular attention should be paid to the implementation of evidence-based guidelines for all patients, regardless of their race and ethnicity.

Support the use of language interpretation services in the clinical setting

As described previously, health care systems that lack efficient and effective interpreter services can lead to patient dissatisfaction, poor comprehension and adherence, and ineffective/lower-quality care for patients with limited English proficiency. Unequal Treatment's recommendation to support the use of interpretation services has clear implications for delivery of quality health care by improving doctors' ability to communicate effectively with patients with limited English proficiency.

Increase the proportion of underrepresented minorities in the health care workforce

Data from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) indicate that in 2004, of the 72.4% of U.S. physicians whose race and ethnicity is known, Hispanics make up 2.8%, blacks 3.3%, and Native American and Alaskan Natives 0.3%. Data regarding the racial/ethnic composition of medical school faculty are no different, with minorities, excluding Asians, composing 7.5% nationally. Additionally, minority faculty in 2007 were more likely to be at or below the rank of assistant professor, while whites composed the highest proportion of full professors. Despite representing about 26% of the U.S. population (a number projected to almost double by 2050), minority students are still underrepresented in medical schools. In 2007, matriculants to U.S. medical school were 7.2% Latino, 6.4% African American, 0.2% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and 0.3% Native American or Alaskann Native. These numbers have decreased or maintained the same since 2006. It will be difficult to develop a diverse health care workforce that can meet the needs of an increasingly diverse population without dramatic change in the racial and ethnic composition of medical student bodies.

Provider Interventions

Integrate Cross-Cultural Education into the Training of All Health Care Professionals

The goal of cross-cultural education is to improve providers' ability to understand, communicate with, and care for patients from diverse backgrounds. Such education focuses on enhancing awareness of sociocultural influences on health beliefs and behaviors, and on building skills to understand and manage these factors in the medical encounter. Cross-cultural education includes curricula on health care disparities, how to use an interpreter, and how to effectively communicate and negotiate across cultures. These curricula can be incorporated into health professions training in medical schools, residency programs, and nursing schools, and as part of continuing education. Despite the importance of this area of education, as well as the attention it has attracted from medical education accreditation bodies, a national survey of senior resident physicians by Weissman and colleagues found that up to 28% felt unprepared to deal with cross-cultural issues, including caring for patients who have religious beliefs that may affect treatment, patients who use complementary medicine, patients with health beliefs at odds with Western medicine, patients with mistrust of the health care system, and new immigrants. Efforts to incorporate cross-cultural education into medical education will contribute to improving communication and to better quality of care for all patients.

Incorporate Teaching on the Impact of Race, Ethnicity, and Culture on Clinical Decision-Making

Unequal Treatment and more recent studies found that stereotyping by health care providers can lead to disparate treatment based on a patient's race or ethnicity. The Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), which accredits medical schools, now has a directive that medical education should teach how a patient's race, ethnicity, and culture might unconsciously impact communication and clinical decision making.

Patient Interventions

Educate Patients on How to Navigate the Health Care System and How to Be More Active in the Medical Encounter

Difficulty navigating the health care system and obtaining access to care can be a hindrance to all populations, particularly to minorities. Similarly, lack of empowerment or involvement in the medical encounter by minorities can be a barrier to care as well. Interventions should be used to increase patients' knowledge of how to best access care and participate in treatment decisions.

General Recommendations

Increase Awareness of Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Health Care

Efforts to raise awareness of racial/ethnic health care disparities have done little for the general public but have been fairly successful among physicians according to a Kaiser Family Foundation report. In 2006, nearly 6 in 10 people surveyed believed blacks received the same quality of care as whites, and 5 in 10 believed Latinos received the same quality care as whites. These estimates are similar to findings in a 1999 survey. Despite this lack of awareness, most believed that all Americans deserve quality care, regardless of their background. In contrast, the level of awareness among physicians has risen sharply. In 2002, the majority (69%) of physicians said that the health care system "rarely or never" treated people unfairly based on an individual's racial/ethnic background. In 2005, less than a quarter (24%) of physicians disagreed with the statement "minority patients generally receive lower quality care than white patients." Increasing awareness of racial and ethnic disparities among health care professionals and the public is an important first step in addressing disparities in health care. The ultimate goal is to generate discourse and mobilize action to address disparities in multiple areas, including at the level of health policy, health systems, and the community.

Conduct Further Research to Identify Sources of Disparities and Promising Interventions

While the literature that formed the basis of the findings and recommendations of Unequal Treatment provided significant evidence for racial and ethnic disparities, additional research is needed in several areas. First, most of the literature on disparities focuses on black-versus-white differences; much less is known about the experiences of other minority groups. Improving the ability to collect racial and ethnic patient data should facilitate this process, but in instances where those systems are not yet in place, racial and ethnic patient data may be collected prospectively in the setting of clinical or health services research to better understand disparities for other populations. Second, much of the literature on disparities to date has focused on defining areas where they exist, but less has been done to identify the multiple factors that contribute to disparities, or to test interventions to address them. There is clearly a need for research that identifies promising practices and solutions to disparities.

Implications for Clinical Practice

Individual health care providers can do several things in the clinical encounter to address racial and ethnic disparities in health care. These approaches are discussed here.

Be Aware that Disparities Exist

Increasing awareness of racial and ethnic disparities among health care professionals is an important first step in addressing disparities in health care. Only then can they be attuned to monitoring their behavior and clinical practice so as to ensure that all patients receive the highest quality of care, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or culture.

Practice Culturally Competent Care

Previous efforts in cultural competence have aimed to teach clinicians about the attitudes, values, beliefs, and behaviors of certain cultural groups¡ªthe key practice "do's and don'ts" for caring for "the Hispanic patient," or the "Asian Patient" for example. In certain situations, learning about a particular local community or cultural group can be helpful (following the principles of community-oriented primary care), but, when broadly and uncritically applied, this approach can also lead to stereotyping and oversimplification of culture without respect for its complexity.

Cultural competence has thus evolved from learning information and making assumptions about patients based on their background to focusing on the development of skills that follow the principles of patient-centered care. Patient centeredness encompasses the qualities of compassion, empathy, and responsiveness to the needs, values, and expressed preferences of the individual patient. Cultural competence aims to take this a step further, by expanding the repertoire of knowledge and skills classically defined as patient-centered to include those that are especially useful in cross-cultural interactions (but remain vital to all clinical encounters). This includes effectively using interpreter services, eliciting the patient's understanding of his or her condition, assessing decision-making preferences and the role of family, determining the patient's views about biomedicine versus complementary and alternative medicine, recognizing sexual and gender issues, and building trust. For example, while it is important to understand all patients' health beliefs, it may be particularly crucial to understand the health beliefs of those who come from a different culture or have a different health care experience. With the individual patient as teacher, one can adjust his or her practice style accordingly to meet the patient's specific needs.

Avoid Stereotyping

Several strategies can allow us to counteract, both systemically and individually, our normal tendency to stereotype. For example, when racially/ethnically/culturally/socially diverse teams are assembled (in which each member is given equal power) and are tasked to achieve a common goal, a sense of camaraderie develops and prevents the future development of stereotypes based on race/ethnicity, gender, culture, or class. Thus, we should aim to gain experiences working with, and learning from, a diverse set of colleagues. In addition, simply being aware of the operation of social cognitive factors allows one to actively "check" or "monitor" behavior. For instance, physicians can constantly ensure that they are offering the same things, in the same ways, to all patients. Understanding how we are susceptible to stereotyping¡ªand how this may lead to disparities¡ªis essential if we are to provide equitable, high-quality care to all patients.

Work to Build Trust

Patient mistrust of the health care system and health care providers impacts multiple facets of the medical encounter, from decreased patient satisfaction to the delay of care. Although the historic legacy of discrimination can never be erased, several steps can be taken to build trust with patients and address disparities. First, providers must be aware that mistrust exists and is more prevalent among minority populations given the history of discrimination in the United States and other countries. Second, providers must reassure patients that they come first, that we will do everything in our power to ensure that they always get the best care possible, and that we will serve as their advocates. Third, interpersonal skills and communication techniques that demonstrate honesty, openness, compassion, and respect on the part of the health care provider are essential tools in dismantling mistrust. Finally, patients indicate that trust is built when there is shared, participatory decision making and the provider makes a concerted effort to understand the patient's background. By reframing the doctor-patient relationship as one of solidarity, the patient's sense of vulnerability can be transformed into one of trust. For the process of eliminating disparities to be successful, we must utilize trust-building interventions and strengthen the doctor-patient relationship.
 
Conclusion

The issue of racial and ethnic disparities in health care has gained national prominence, both with the release of the IOM report Unequal Treatment and with more recent articles that have confirmed their persistence and explored their root causes. Furthermore, another influential IOM report, Crossing the Quality Chasm, highlights the importance of equity¡ªthat there be no variations in quality of care by personal characteristics including race and ethnicity¡ªas a central principle of quality. There are many obvious opportunities for interventions to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in health care. Greater attention to addressing the root causes of disparities will improve the care provided to all patients, not just those who are racial and ethnic minorities.

Ethical Issues in Clinical Medicine: Introduction

Physicians frequently confront ethical issues in clinical practice that are perplexing, time-consuming, and emotionally draining. Experience, common sense, and simply being a good person do not guarantee that physicians can identify or resolve ethical dilemmas. Knowledge about common ethical dilemmas is also essential.
 
Fundamental Ethical Guidelines

Physicians should follow two fundamental but frequently conflicting ethical guidelines: respect patient autonomy and act in the patient's best interests.

Respecting Patient Autonomy

Treating patients with respect requires doctors to accept the medical decisions of persons who are informed and acting freely. Individuals place different values on health, medical care, and risk. In most clinical settings, different goals and approaches are possible, outcomes are uncertain, and an intervention may cause both benefits and harms. Thus competent, informed patients may refuse recommended interventions and choose among reasonable alternatives.

Informed Consent

For patients to make informed decisions, physicians need to discuss with them the nature of the proposed care, the alternatives, the risks and benefits of each, and the likely consequences, and obtain the patient's agreement to care. Informed consent involves more than obtaining signatures on consent forms. Physicians need to educate patients, answer questions, make recommendations, and help them deliberate. Patients can be overwhelmed with medical jargon, needlessly complicated explanations, or too much information at once.

Nondisclosure of Information

Physicians may consider withholding a serious diagnosis, misrepresenting it, or limiting discussions of prognosis or risks because they fear that a patient will develop severe anxiety or depression or refuse needed care. Generally, physicians should provide relevant information, while adjusting the pace of disclosure, offering empathy and hope, and helping patients cope with bad news.

In many cultures, patients traditionally are not told of a diagnosis of cancer or of other serious illness because such disclosure is believed to cause patients to suffer, while withholding information is believed to promote serenity, security, and hope. Patients should not be forced to receive information against their will, even in the name of promoting informed decisions. However, many individuals want to know their diagnosis and prognosis, even if they are terminally ill. Physicians, therefore, should ask patients how they want health care decisions to be made, adding that they usually provide information and make decisions together with patients, while offering patients the option not to receive information or to turn decision-making over to someone else.

Emergency Care

Informed consent is not required when patients cannot give consent and when delay of treatment would place their lives or health in peril. People are presumed to want such emergency care, unless they have previously indicated otherwise.

Futile Interventions

Autonomy does not entitle patients to insist on whatever care they want. Physicians are not obligated to provide futile interventions that have no physiologic rationale or have already failed. For example, cardiopulmonary resuscitation would be futile in a patient with progressive hypotension despite maximal therapy. But physicians should be wary of using the term futile in looser senses to justify unilateral decisions to forego interventions when they believe that the probability of success is too low, no worthwhile goals can be achieved, the patient's quality of life is unacceptable, or the costs are too high. Such looser usages of the term are problematic because they may be inconsistent and mask important value judgments. Several states have laws allowing physicians not to provide interventions that they deem futile or not medically indicated, provided they follow procedures such as obtaining the concurrence of the hospital ethics committee and giving the patient an opportunity to be transferred to another hospital.

Maintaining Confidentiality

Confidentiality respects patients' autonomy and privacy, encourages them to seek treatment and discuss their problems candidly, and prevents discrimination. However, maintaining confidentiality is not an absolute rule. Confidentiality may be overridden in certain situations to prevent serious harm to third parties or to the patient. The law may require physicians to override confidentiality in order to protect third parties, as with reporting of tuberculosis and syphilis. In other situations, medical providers have a legal duty to report victims of elder abuse, child abuse, and domestic violence. These exceptions to confidentiality are justified because the risk is serious and probable, there are no less-restrictive measures to avert risk, the adverse effects of overriding confidentiality are minimized, and these adverse effects are deemed acceptable by society.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) health privacy regulations have heightened awareness of the importance of confidentiality. These regulations are not meant to inhibit transmission of information needed for treatment: disclosure of patient information to other health care providers for the purposes of treatment without having the patient sign an authorization form is permissible.

Avoiding Deception

Health care providers sometimes consider using lies or deception in order to protect the patient from bad news or to obtain benefits for the patient. Lying refers to statements that the speaker knows are false and that are intended to mislead the listener. Deception, which is broader, includes statements and actions that are intended to mislead the listener, whether or not they are literally true. For example, the health care provider may tell a patient that she has a "small growth" so that she does not think she has cancer. Or the provider may complete and sign a form for a patient to get a bus pass, even though he does not meet criteria for physical disability. Although such deception may be motivated by a desire to help the patient, it is ethically problematic. The person who is deceived cannot make informed decisions if he or she receives misleading information. Furthermore, deception undermines physicians' credibility and trustworthiness.

Acting in the Best Interests of Patients

The guideline of beneficence requires physicians to act for the patient's benefit. Laypeople do not possess medical expertise and may be vulnerable because of their illness. They justifiably rely on physicians to provide sound advice and to promote their well-being. Physicians encourage such trust. Hence, physicians have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the patient, which should prevail over physicians' self-interest or the interests of third parties, such as hospitals or insurers. These fiduciary obligations of physicians contrast sharply with business relationships, which are characterized by "let the buyer beware," not by trust and reliance. The guideline of "do no harm" forbids physicians from providing ineffective interventions or acting without due care. This precept, while often cited, provides only limited guidance, because many beneficial interventions also have serious risks.

Conflicts between Beneficence and Autonomy

Patients' refusals of care may thwart their own goals or cause them serious harm. For example, a young man with asthma may refuse mechanical ventilation for reversible respiratory failure. Simply to accept such refusals, in the name of respecting autonomy, seems morally constricted. Physicians can elicit patients' expectations and concerns, correct misunderstandings, and try to persuade them to accept beneficial therapies. If disagreements persist after discussions, the patient's informed choices and view of his or her best interests should prevail. While refusing recommended care does not render a patient incompetent, it may lead the physician to probe further to ensure that the patient is able to make informed decisions.

Justice

The term justice is used in a general sense to mean fairness: people should receive what they deserve. In addition, it is important to act consistently in cases that are similar in ethically relevant ways. Otherwise, decisions would be arbitrary, biased, and unfair. Justice forbids discrimination in health care based on race, religion, or gender and supports a moral right to health care, with access based on medical need rather than ability to pay.
 
Patients WHO Lack Decision-Making Capacity

Patients may not be able to make informed decisions because of unconsciousness, dementia, delirium, or other conditions. Physicians should ask two questions regarding such patients: Who is the appropriate surrogate? What would the patient want done?

Assessing Capacity to Make Medical Decisions

All adults are considered legally competent unless declared incompetent by a court. In practice, physicians usually determine that patients lack the capacity to make health care decisions and arrange for surrogates to make them, without involving the courts. By definition, competent patients can express a choice and appreciate the medical situation; the nature of the proposed care; the alternatives; and the risks, benefits, and consequences of each. Their choices should be consistent with their values and should not result from delusions or hallucinations. Psychiatrists may help in difficult cases because they are skilled at interviewing mentally impaired patients and can identify treatable depression or psychosis. When impairments are fluctuating or reversible, decisions should be postponed if possible until the patient recovers decision-making capacity.

Choice of Surrogate

If a patient lacks decision-making capacity, physicians routinely ask family members to serve as surrogates. Most patients want their family members to be surrogates, and family members generally know the patient's preferences and have the patient's best interests at heart. Patients may designate a particular individual to serve as proxy; such choices should be respected. Some states have established a prioritized list of which relative may serve as surrogate if the patient has not designated a proxy.

Standards for Surrogate Decision-Making

Advance Directives

These are statements by competent patients to direct care if they lose decision-making capacity. They may indicate (1) what interventions they would refuse or accept or (2) who should serve as surrogate. Following the patient's advance directives, the surrogate respects the patient's autonomy.

Oral conversations are the most frequent form of advance directives. While such conversations are customarily followed in clinical practice, casual or vague comments may not be trustworthy. Living wills direct physicians to forego or provide life-sustaining interventions if the patient develops a terminal condition or persistent vegetative state. Generally patients may refuse only interventions that "merely prolong the process of dying."

A health care proxy is someone appointed by the patient to make health care decisions if he or she loses decision-making capacity. It is more flexible and comprehensive than the living will, applying whenever the patient is unable to make decisions.

Physicians can encourage patients to carry out advance care planning, which might include clarifying values and priorities, identifying unfinished goals, and addressing spiritual concerns. Such discussions often facilitate completion of advance directives. In discussions with patients, physicians can ensure that advance directives are informed, up-to-date, and address likely clinical scenarios. Such discussions are best carried out in the ambulatory setting. The federal Patient Self-Determination Act requires hospitals and health maintenance organizations to inform patients of their right to make health care decisions and to provide advance directives.

Substituted Judgment

In the absence of clear advance directives, surrogates and physicians should try to decide as the patient would under the circumstances, using all information that they know about the patient. While such substituted judgments try to respect the patient's values, they may be speculative or inaccurate. A surrogate may be mistaken about the patient's preferences, particularly when they have not been discussed explicitly.

Best Interests

When the patient's preferences are unclear or unknown, decisions should be based on the patient's best interests. Patients generally take into account the quality of life as well as the duration of life when making decisions for themselves. It is understandable that surrogates would also consider quality of life of patients who lack decision-making capacity. Judgments about quality of life are appropriate if they reflect the patient's own values. Bias or discrimination may occur, however, if others project their values onto the patient or weigh the perceived social worth of the patient. Most patients with chronic illness rate their quality of life higher than their family members and physicians do.

Legal Issues

Physicians need to know pertinent state laws regarding patients who lack decision-making capacity. A few state courts allow doctors to forego life-sustaining interventions only if patients have provided written advance directives or very specific oral ones.

Disagreements

Disagreements may occur among potential surrogates or between the physician and surrogate. Physicians can remind everyone to base decisions on what the patient would want, not what they would want for themselves. Consultation with the hospital ethics committee or with another physician often helps resolve disputes. Such consultation is also helpful when patients have no surrogate and no advance directives. The courts should be used only as a last resort when disagreements cannot be resolved in the clinical setting.
 
Decisions About Life-Sustaining Interventions

Although medical technology can save lives, it can also prolong the process of dying. Competent, informed patients may refuse life-sustaining interventions. When patients lack decision-making capacity, such interventions may also be withheld on the basis of advance directives or decisions by appropriate surrogates. Courts have ruled that foregoing life-sustaining interventions is neither suicide nor murder.

Misleading Distinctions

People commonly draw distinctions that are intuitively plausible but prove untenable on closer analysis.

Extraordinary and Ordinary Care

Some physicians are willing to forego "extraordinary" or "heroic" interventions, such as surgery, mechanical ventilation, or renal dialysis but insist on providing "ordinary" ones, such as antibiotics, IV fluids, or feeding tubes. However, this distinction is not logical because all medical interventions have both risks and benefits. Any intervention may be withheld, if the burdens for the individual patient outweigh the benefits.

Withdrawing and Withholding Interventions

Many health care providers find it more difficult to discontinue interventions than to withhold them in the first place. Although such emotions need to be acknowledged, there is no logical distinction between the two acts. Reasons that justify withholding interventions, such as refusal by patients or surrogates, also justify withdrawing them. In addition, after an intervention has been started, new data may indicate that it is no longer appropriate. The intervention may prove unsuccessful, or it may be learned that the patient did not want the intervention. If interventions could never be discontinued, patients and surrogates might not even attempt treatments that might prove beneficial.

Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (Dnar) Orders

When a patient suffers a cardiopulmonary arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is initiated unless a DNAR order has been made. Although CPR can restore people to vigorous health, it can also disrupt a peaceful death. After CPR is attempted on a general hospital service, only 14% of patients survive to discharge, and even fewer in certain subgroups. DNAR orders are appropriate if the patient or surrogate requests them or if CPR would be futile. To prevent misunderstandings, physicians should write DNAR orders and the reasons for them in the medical record. "Slow" or "show" codes that merely appear to provide CPR are deceptive and therefore unacceptable. Although a DNAR order signifies only that CPR will be withheld, the reasons that justify DNAR orders may lead to a reconsideration of other plans for care. Many hospitals have standardized order forms that specify whether other life-sustaining interventions, such as intubation and mechanical ventilation, are to be administered or withheld.

Assisted Suicide and Active Euthanasia

Proponents of these controversial acts believe that competent, terminally ill patients should have control over the end of life and that physicians should relieve refractory suffering. Opponents assert that such actions violate the sanctity of life, that suffering can generally be relieved, that abuses are inevitable, and that such actions are outside the physician's proper role. These actions are illegal throughout the United States, except that physician-assisted suicide is legal in Oregon and Washington under restricted circumstances. Whatever their personal views, physicians should respond to patients' inquiries about these actions with compassion and concern. Physicians should elicit and address any underlying problems, such as physical symptoms, loss of control, or depression. Often, additional efforts to relieve distress are successful, and after this is done patients generally withdraw their requests for these acts.

Care of Dying Patients

Patients often suffer unrelieved pain and other symptoms during their final days of life. Physicians may hesitate to order high doses of narcotics and sedatives, fearing they will hasten death. Relieving distressing symptoms in terminal illness and when patients forego life-sustaining interventions such as mechanical ventilation enhances patient comfort and dignity. If lower doses of narcotics and sedatives have failed to relieve suffering, increasing the dose to levels that might suppress respiratory drive or lower blood pressure is ethically appropriate because the physician's intention is to relieve suffering, not hasten death. Such palliative sedation is distinguished ethically and legally from active euthanasia, which is administering a lethal dose with the intention of ending the patient's life. Physicians can also relieve suffering by spending time with dying patients, listening to them, and attending to their psychological distress.
 
Conflicts of Interest

Acting in the patient's best interests may conflict with the physician's self-interest or the interests of third parties such as insurers or hospitals. The ethical ideal is to keep the patient's interests paramount. Even the appearance of a conflict of interest may undermine trust in the profession.

Financial Incentives

The 2010 health care reform law includes pilot programs that offer physicians financial incentives to improve the quality and efficiency of care. There are concerns that pay-for-performance incentives may lead physicians to avoid sicker, more complicated patients or to focus on benchmarked interventions even if they are not in the best interests of an individual patient. In contrast, physicians have incentives to provide interventions regardless of the probability or magnitude of benefit when they receive fee-for-service reimbursement or when they refer patients to laboratory or imaging facilities in which they have a financial stake. Regardless of financial incentives, physicians should recommend available care that is in the patient's best interests, no more and no less.

Relationships with Pharmaceutical and Device Companies

Financial relationships between physicians and industry are under increasing scrutiny. Gifts from drug and device companies may create an inappropriate risk of undue influence, induce subconscious feelings of reciprocity, impair public trust, and increase the cost of health care. Policies at many academic medical centers and companies have eliminated pens, notepads, and meals to physicians. Under new federal sunshine requirements, companies must disclose publicly the names of physicians to whom they have made payments together with the amount of payment. It will be a challenge to structure such disclosure to distinguish between payments for scientific consulting, contracts, and grants¡ªwhich are consistent with professional and academic missions and need to be encouraged¡ªfrom promotional speaking and consulting whose goal is to increase sales of company products.

Occupational Risks

Some health care workers, fearing fatal occupational infections, refuse to care for persons with HIV infection or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Such fears about personal safety need to be acknowledged, and health care institutions should reduce occupational risk by providing proper training, protective equipment, and supervision. To fulfill their mission of helping patients, physicians should provide appropriate care within their clinical expertise, despite some personal risk.

Medical Errors

Errors are inevitable in clinical medicine. They may cause serious harm to patients or result in substantial changes in management. Physicians and students may fear that disclosing such errors could damage their careers. Without disclosure, however, patients cannot understand their clinical situation or make informed choices about subsequent care. Furthermore, patients are often outraged when physicians do not acknowledge and apologize for errors. Several states have enacted laws that allow physicians to say they are sorry for errors without increasing legal liability. Similarly, unless attending physicians are informed of trainees' errors, they cannot provide optimal care and help trainees learn from mistakes.

Learning Clinical Skills

Learning clinical medicine, particularly learning to perform invasive procedures, may present inconvenience or risk to patients. To ensure patient cooperation, students may be introduced as physicians or patients may not be told that trainees will be performing procedures. Such misrepresentation undermines trust, may lead to more elaborate deception, and makes it difficult for patients to make informed choices about their care. Patients should be told who is providing care, what benefits and burdens can be attributed to trainees, and how trainees are supervised. Most patients, when informed, allow trainees to play an active role in their care.

Impaired Physicians

Physicians may hesitate to intervene when colleagues impaired by alcohol abuse, drug abuse, or psychiatric or medical illness place patients at risk. However, society relies on physicians to regulate themselves. If colleagues of an impaired physician do not take steps to protect patients, no one else may be in a position to do so.

Conflicts for Trainees

Medical students and residents may fear that they will receive poor grades or evaluations if they act on the patient's behalf by disclosing mistakes, avoiding misrepresentation of their role, and reporting impaired colleagues. Discussing such dilemmas with more senior physicians can help trainees check their interpretation of the situation and obtain advice and assistance.
 
Allocating Resources Justly

Access to needed care still remains a moral aspiration in the United States, even after the passage of health care reform laws in 2010. Physicians caring for underserved populations must act ethically in a health care system that has serious ethical shortcomings in access to and quality of care. Some patients with a clear need for medical care cannot pay for medications, tests, or hospitalizations, or the insurer may deny coverage. If this occurs, physicians should advocate for patients, trying to help them obtain needed care. Doctors might consider, or patients might request, using lying or deception to help them gain such benefits. However, avoiding deception is a basic ethical guideline that sets limits on advocating for patients. Allocation of health care resources is unavoidable because resources are limited. Ideally, allocation decisions should be made as public policy, with physician input. Allocation of resources at the bedside on an ad hoc basis is problematic because it may be inconsistent, unfair, and ineffective. At the bedside, physicians generally should act as patient advocates within constraints set by society, reasonable insurance coverage, and evidence-based practice. For example, a patient's insurer may have a higher copayment for nonformulary drugs. It is reasonable for physicians to advocate for nonformulary drugs only if there are compelling reasons for an exception, as when the formulary drugs are ineffective or not tolerated.
 
Assistance with Ethical Issues

Discussing perplexing ethical issues with other members of the health care team, colleagues, or the hospital ethics committee often clarifies issues and suggests ways to improve communication and to deal with strong emotions. When struggling with difficult ethical issues, physicians may need to reevaluate their basic convictions, tolerate uncertainty, and maintain their integrity while respecting the opinions of others.

Neoplasia During Pregnancy: Introduction

Cancer develops during 1 in every 1000 pregnancies. Of all the cancers that occur in women, less than 1% occur in pregnant women. The four cancers most commonly developing during pregnancy are cervical cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, and lymphomas (particularly Hodgkin's lymphoma); however, virtually every form of cancer has been reported in pregnant women (Table e6-1). In addition to cancers developing in other organs of the mother, gestational trophoblastic tumors can arise from the placenta. The problem of cancer in a pregnant woman is complex. One must take into account the possible influence of the pregnancy on the natural history of the cancer, the effects of the diagnostic and staging procedures, and the treatments of the cancer on both the mother and the developing fetus. Theese issues may lead to dilemmas: what is best for the mother may be harmful to the fetus, and what is best for the fetus may be harmful to the mother.

b Based on accumulating case reports from the literature; the precision of these data is not high.
 

Another complicating issue in women who develop cancer during pregnancy is that many of the early symptoms of cancer are ignored in pregnant women. The many changes in a woman's body during pregnancy dull one's senses to changes that may be related to an underlying disease rather than the pregnancy. Thus, many cancers that occur in pregnancy present in advanced stages.

As a general rule, one should assume that no diagnostic or therapeutic intervention is safe in the first trimester of pregnancy other than surgery. If the mother develops life-threatening complications during the first trimester that require radiation therapy or systemic chemotherapy, and these interventions cannot be safely delayed, a recommendation should be made for an abortion. Indeed, radiation, even in the form of diagnostic radiography, should be avoided throughout pregnancy. No exposure to radiation is safe, and efforts to shield the fetus with barriers placed on the abdomen cannot block internal scatter radiation. It is safest to omit radiation exposure of any kind. Fortunately, its use is seldom an essential component of treatment before delivery.

Chemotherapy exposure is also to be avoided, if at all possible. It should never be given in the first trimester; a variety of single agents and combinations have been given in the second and third trimesters, without a high frequency of catastrophic effects to the pregnancy or the fetus, but data on safety are sparse. Maternal factors that may influence the pharmacology of chemotherapeutic agents include the 50% increase in plasma volume, altered absorption and protein binding, increased glomerular filtration rate, increased hepatic mixed function oxidase activity, and third space created by amniotic fluid. The fetus is protected from some agents by placental expression of drug efflux pumps, but decreased fetal hepatic mixed function oxidase and glucuronidation activity may prolong the half-life of agents that do cross the placenta. A database on the risks associated with individual chemotherapy agents is available on the Internet (www.motherisk.org).

The optimal management strategies have not been developed based on prospective clinical trials. Instead, a guiding principle has been to delay therapeutic interventions until as late as possible during the pregnancy. Delivery is recommended at 32 weeks. By and large, this approach minimizes exposure of the child to noxious cancer treatments, spares the mother complications of pregnancy, and is generally accomplished without an adverse impact on treatment outcome. Pregnancy appears to have little or no impact on the natural history of malignancies, despite the hormonal influences. Spread of the mother's cancer to the fetus (so-called vertical transmission) is exceedingly rare.
 
Cervical Cancer During Pregnancy

The incidence of cervical cancer in pregnant women is roughly comparable to that of age-matched controls who are not pregnant. Invasive cervical cancer develops at a rate of about 0.45 in 1000 live births and carcinoma in situ is seen in 1 in 750 pregnancies. About 1% of women diagnosed with cervical cancer are pregnant at the time of diagnosis. Early signs of cervical cancer include vaginal spotting or discharge, pain, and postcoital bleeding that are also common features of pregnancy. Early visual changes in the cervix related to invasive cancer can be mistaken for cervical decidualization or ectropion (columnar epithelium on the cervix) due to pregnancy. Women diagnosed with cervical cancer during pregnancy report having had symptoms for 4.5 months on average.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 account for about 70% of cervical cancer. The rate of carriage of these serotypes can be reduced with the use of vaccination before exposure. Screening is recommended at the first prenatal visit and 6 weeks postpartum. The rate of cytologic abnormalities on Pap smear in pregnant women is about 5¨C8% and is not much different than the rate in nonpregnant women of the same age. Consensus guidelines dictate that specific tests are indicated based on the level of atypia seen on Pap smear. Atypical squamous cells of unknown significance (ASCUS) generally trigger HPV testing with colposcopy reserved for the subset of women with a high-risk HPV-type infection. By contrast, the presence of dysplasia is considered an indication for colposcopy regardless of HPV type. Women with either low- or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL or HSIL) and HIV-infected women with ASCUS are recommended for colposcopy.

At colposcopy, any areas suspicious for invasive disease are biopsied. However, endocervical curettage is contraindicated in pregnant patients. The only indication for therapy of cervical neoplasia in pregnant women is the documentation of invasive cancer. Accordingly, some physicians defer colposcopy in pregnant women until six weeks post-partum unless they are at high risk for invasive disease. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia has a low risk of progression to invasive cancer during pregnancy (0.4%) and many such lesions (36¨C70%) regress spontaneously postpartum. If invasive disease is suspected at colposcopy and the pregnancy is between 16 and 20 weeks, a cone biopsy may be performed to make the diagnosis; however, the procedure is associated with bleeding because of the increased vasculature in the gravid cervix and increases the risk of premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor two- to threefold. Cone biopsy should not be done within 4 weeks of delivery.

Management of invasive disease is guided by the stage of disease, the gestational age of the fetus, and the desire of the mother to have the baby. If the disease is in early stage and the pregnancy is desired, it is safe to delay treatment regardless of gestational age until fetal maturity allows for safe delivery. If the disease is in advanced stage and the pregnancy is desired, the safety of delaying therapy is unproven. Abortion followed by definitive therapy is recommended for women with advanced cancer in the first or second trimester (see Chap. 97). In women in the third trimester with advanced disease, the baby should be delivered at the earliest possible time and followed immediately by stage-appropriate therapy. Most women with invasive cancer have early-stage disease. If the disease is microinvasive, vaginal delivery can take place and be followed by definitive treatment, usually conization. If a lesion is visible on the cervix, delivery is best done by caesarian section and followed by radical hysterectomy.
 
Breast Cancer During Pregnancy

Breast cancer occurs once in 3000 to 10,000 live births. About 5% of all breast cancers occur in women 40 years or younger. Among all premenopausal women with breast cancer, 25¨C30% were pregnant at the time of diagnosis. While early pregnancy is a protective factor against breast cancer in women as a whole, the breast cancers diagnosed during pregnancy are often diagnosed at a later stage of disease and so have a poorer outcome. The late diagnosis has at least two contributions. One is the more aggressive behavior of the cancer possibly related to the hormonal milieu (estrogen increases 100-fold; progesterone increases 1000-fold) of the pregnancy. However, about 70% of the breast cancers found in pregnancy are estrogen receptor¨Cnegative. Another factor is that early physical signs of the disease are often attributed to the changes that occur in the breast normally as a part of pregnancy. However, a breast mass in a pregnant woman is never normal. Younger women with breast cancer have a higher likelihood of having mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Pregnancy retains its protective effects in carriers of BRCA1 mutations; such women with four or more children had a 38% reduction in breast cancer risk compared to nulliparous carriers. However, pregnancy seems to increase the risk of breast cancer among carriers of BRCA2 mutations, particularly in the first 2 years after pregnancy. About 28¨C58% of the tumors express HER-2.

Primary tumors in pregnant women are 3.5 cm on average, compared to <2 cm in nonpregnant women. A dominant mass and a nipple discharge are the most common presenting signs and they should prompt ultrasonography and breast MRI exam (if available) followed by lumpectomy if the mass is solid and aspiration if the mass is cystic. Mammography is less reliable in pregnancy due to the increased breast density. Needle aspirates of breast masses in pregnant women are often nondiagnostic or falsely positive. Even in pregnancy, most breast masses are benign (80% are adenoma, lobular hyperplasia, milk retention cyst, fibrocystic disease, fibroadenoma, and other rarer entities).

Differences between pregnancy-associated breast cancer (often defined as cancer detected during the pregnancy and up to 1 year after delivery) are shown in Table e6-2. About 20% of breast cancers are detected in the first trimester, 45% in the second trimester, and 35% in the third trimester. Some argue that stage for stage, the outcome is the same for breast cancer diagnosed in pregnant and nonpregnant women.

a Lower measured levels could be in part artifactual due to the increased levels of estrogen in the milieu
 

Staging the axillary lymph nodes is currently somewhat controversial. Sentinel lymph node sampling is not straightforward in pregnant women. Blue dye has been carcinogenic in rats, and shielding the fetus from administered radionuclides is of unproven efficacy. For this reason, many surgeons favor axillary node dissection to stage the nodes. Largely due to the typical delay in diagnosis, axillary nodes are more often positive in pregnant than in nonpregnant women.

As with other types of cancer in pregnant women, diagnosis in the first trimester often triggers a recommendation for an abortion to allow definitive therapeutic intervention at the earliest possible time. While definitive local surgery is applicable in the first trimester, radiation therapy and chemotherapy are considerably more risky. Delay in administration of systemic therapy can increase the risk of axillary spread. In the second and third trimesters, chemotherapy (particularly anthracycline-based combinations) are both safe and effective (see Chap. 90). Lumpectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy is frequently used; fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide with either doxorubicin or epirubicin have been given without major risk to the fetus. Taxanes and gemcitabine are also beginning to be used; however, safety data are sparse. Methotrexate and other folate antagonists are to be avoided because of effects on the fetal nervous system. Myelotoxic therapy is generally not administered after the 33rd or 34th week of gestation to allow 3 weeks off therapy before delivery for recovery of blood counts. Endocrine therapy and trastuzumab are unsafe during pregnancy. Experience with lapatinib is anecdotal, but no fetal malformations have been reported. Antiemetics and colony-stimulating factors are also considered safe. Women being treated into the postpartum period should not nurse their babies because of excretion of cancer chemotherapy agents, particularly alkylating agents, in milk.

Subsequent pregnancies following gestational breast cancer do not appear to influence relapse rate or overall survival. Indeed, a meta-analysis has suggested that pregnancy in breast cancer survivors may reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer by as much as 42%.
 
Melanoma During Pregnancy

Speculation about melanoma occurring during pregnancy based largely on anecdotal evidence and small case series concluded that it occurred with increased frequency, was more aggressive in its natural history, and was caused in part by the hormonal changes that also produced hyperpigmentation (so-called melasma) during pregnancy. However, more complete epidemiologic data suggest that melanoma is no more frequent in pregnant women than in nonpregnant women in the same age group, melanoma is not more aggressive during pregnancy, and that hormones seem to have little or nothing to do with the etiology. Pregnant and nonpregnant women do not differ in the location of primary tumor, depth of primary tumor, tumor ulceration, or vascular invasion.

Suspicious lesions should be looked for and managed definitively with excisional biopsy during pregnancy. Wide excision with sampling of regional lymph nodes is warranted. If lymph nodes are involved, the course of action is less clear. Several agents have demonstrated some activity in melanoma, but none have been used during pregnancy. Adjuvant interferon-alfa is toxic and its safety in pregnancy has not been documented. Agents active in advanced disease include dacarbazine, interleukin-2, ipilumimab (antibody to CTLA-4), and in those with BRAF mutation V600E, a BRAF kinase inhibitor. In the setting of metastatic disease, abortion may be indicated so that systemic therapy can be initiated as soon as possible (see Chap. 87).

Pregnancy subsequent to the diagnosis and treatment of melanoma is also not associated with an increased risk of melanoma recurrence.
 
Hodgkin's Disease and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma During Pregnancy

(See Chap. 110) Hodgkin's disease occurs mainly in the age range of people who are of child-bearing age. However, Hodgkin's disease is not more common in pregnant than nonpregnant women. Hodgkin's disease is diagnosed in approximately 1 in 6,000 pregnancies. It generally presents as a nontender lymph node swelling, most often in the left supraclavicular region. It may be accompanied by B symptoms (fever, night sweats, unexplained weight loss). Excisional biopsy is the preferred diagnostic procedure as fine-needle aspiration cannot reveal the architectural framework that is an essential component of Hodgkin's disease diagnosis. The stage at presentation appears to be unaffected by pregnancy. Women diagnosed in the second and third trimester can be treated safely with combination chemotherapy, usually doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD). In general, the patient in the first trimester is asymptomatic and a woman with a desired pregnancy can be followed until the second or third trimester when definitive multiagent chemotherapy, can be safely given. Radiation therapy is not given during pregnancy. If symptoms requiring treatment appear during the first trimester, anecdotal evidence suggests that Hodgkin's disease symptoms can be controlled with weekly low-dose vinblastine. Such an approach has been safely used to avoid termination of pregnancy. Pregnancy does not have an adverse effect on treatment outcome.

Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are more unusual in pregnancy (approximately 0.8 per 100,000 pregnancies), but are usually tumors with an aggressive natural history like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, or peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Diagnosis relies on an excisional biopsy of a tumor mass, not fine-needle aspiration. Staging evaluation is generally limited to ultrasound or MRI examinations. Diagnosis in the first trimester should prompt termination of the pregnancy followed by definitive treatment with combination chemotherapy, as aggressive lymphomas are not likely to be held at bay with single-agent chemotherapy. Women diagnosed in the second or third trimesters can be treated with standard chemotherapy, such as with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP). The experience with rituximab in this setting is anecdotal. However, infants born of mothers who have received rituximab may have transient delay in B-cell development that typically normalizes by 6 months. The treatment outcome is similar in lymphomas diagnosed in pregnant and nonpregnant women of the same clinical stage.
 
Thyroid Cancer During Pregnancy

(See Chap. 341) Thyroid cancer along with melanomas, brain tumors, and lymphomas are cancers that are increasing in incidence in the general population. Thyroid cancers are rising faster among women in North America than the other increasing tumor types. The Endocrine Society has developed practice guidelines to inform the management of patients with thyroid disease during pregnancy (http://www.endo-society.org/guidelines/final/upload/Clinical-Guideline-Executive-Summary-Management-of-Thyroid-Dysfunction-during-Pregnancy-Postpartum.pdf). Thyroid nodules 1 cm or larger are approached by fine-needle aspiration. If a malignancy is diagnosed, surgery is generally recommended in the second and third trimesters. However, surgical complications appear to be twice as common when the patient is pregnant. Because the growth of thyroid tumors is often indolent, surgery is not recommended in the first trimester. Patients with follicular cancer or early papillary cancer can be observed until the postpartum period. Radioactive iodine can be safely administered after delivery. Patients with a history of thyroid cancer who become pregnant should be maintained on thyroid hormone replacement during pregnancy because of the adverse impact of maternal hypothyroidism on the fetus. Women who are breast-feeding should not be treated with radioactive iodine and women treated with radioactive iodine should not become pregnant for 6¨C12 months after treatment.

The assessment of thyroid function during pregnancy is challenging because of the physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy. Women who have previously been treated for thyroid cancer are at risk of hypothyroidism. The demand for thyroid hormone increases during pregnancy, and doses to maintain normal function may increase by 30¨C50%. Total T4 levels are higher during pregnancy but target therapeutic levels also increase (Table e6-3). It is recommended that the upper and lower limits of the laboratory range be multiplied by 1.5 in the second and third trimester to establish a pregnancy-specific normal range. The target TSH level is lower than 2.5 mIU/L.

Gestational Trophoblastic Disease

(See Chap. 97) Gestational Trophoblastic Disease encompasses hydatidiform mole, choriocarcinoma, placental site trophoblastic tumor, and assorted miscellaneous and unclassifiable trophoblastic tumors. Moles are the most common, occurring in 1 in 1500 preg-nancies in the United States. The incidence is higher in Asia. In general, if the serum level of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) returns to normal after surgical removal (evacuation) of the mole, the illness is considered gestational trophoblastic disease. By contrast, if the HCG level remains elevated after mole evacuation, the patient is considered to have gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Choriocarcinoma occurs in 1 in 25,000 pregnancies. Maternal age >45 years and prior history of molar pregnancy are risk factors. A previous molar pregnancy makes choriocarcinoma about 1000 times more likely to occur (incidence 1¨C2%).

Hydatidiform moles are characterized by clusters of villi with hydropic changes, trophoblastic hyperplasia, and absence of fetal blood vessels. Invasive moles are distinguished by invasion of the myometrium. Placental site trophoblastic tumors are composed mainly of cytotrophoblast cells arising at the site of placental origin. Choriocarcinomas contain anaplastic trophoblastic tissue with both cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast features and no identifiable villi.

Moles can be partial or complete. Partial moles have a distinct molecular origin and usually are smaller tumors with less hydropic villi. Partial moles result from fertilization of an egg by two sperm, resulting in diandric triploidy. Complete moles usually have a 46,XX genotype; 95% develop by a single male sperm fertilizing an empty egg and undergoing gene duplication (diandric diploidy); 5% develop from dispermic fertilization of an empty egg (diandric dispermy).

Women with gestational trophoblastic disease often present with first-trimester bleeding and unusually large uterine size. Ultrasound shows absence of fetal parts or heart sounds. Patients are monitored by chest radiograph, pelvic examination, and weekly measurement of HCG levels.

Patients with molar pregnancies require suction curettage with postoperative HCG monitoring. In 80% of cases, HCG declines within 8¨C10 days. Patients should not become pregnant for at least 12 months. Women with invasive moles generally undergo hysterectomy followed by chemotherapy. About half of choriocarcinomas develop after a molar pregnancy and half develop after ectopic pregnancy or rarely, after a normal full-term pregnancy. Disease is classified as stage I if it is confined to the uterus, stage II if disease is limited to genital structures (30% have vaginal involvement), stage III if disease has spread to the lungs but no other organs, and stage IV if disease has spread to liver, brain, or other organs.

Specific criteria have been developed to aid the decision about when disease becomes neoplasia:

Four consecutive increased HCG levels over the 3 weeks after evacuation surgery.

A rise in HCG of 10% or more on three consecutive values over 2 or more weeks.

The presence of choriocarcinoma.

Persistent HCG elevations 6 months after evacuation.

Patients without widely metastatic disease are generally managed with single-agent methotrexate (either 30 mg/m2 IM weekly until HCG normalizes or 1 mg/kg IM every other day for 4 doses followed by leukovorin 0.1 mg/kg IV 24 hours after methotrexate), which cures >90% of patients. Patients with very high HCG levels, presenting >4 months after a pregnancy, with brain or liver metastases, or failing to be cured by single agent methotrexate are treated with combination chemotherapy. Etoposide, methotrexate, and dactinomycin alternating with cyclophosphamide and vincristine (EMA-CO) is the most commonly used regimen producing long-term survival in >80% of patients. Brain metastases can usually be controlled with brain radiation therapy. Women cured of trophoblastic disease who have not undergone hysterectomy do not appear to have increased risk of fetal abnormalities or maternal complications with subsequent pregnancies.
