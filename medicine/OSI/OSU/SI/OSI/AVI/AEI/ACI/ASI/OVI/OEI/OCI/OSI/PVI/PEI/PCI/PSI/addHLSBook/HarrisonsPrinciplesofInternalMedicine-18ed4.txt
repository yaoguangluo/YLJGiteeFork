
Stem Cell Biology: Introduction

Stem cell biology is a rapidly expanding field that explores the characteristics and possible clinical applications of a variety of stem cells that serve as the progenitors of more differentiated cell types. In addition to potential therapeutic applications (Chap. 67), patient-derived stem cells can also be used as disease models and a means to test drug effectiveness. Stem cells and their niche are becoming a major focus of medical research because they play central roles in tissue and organ homeostasis and repair, which are important aspects of aging and disease.

Identification, Isolation, and Derivation of Stem Cells

Resident Stem Cells

The definition of stem cells remains elusive. Stem cells were originally postulated as unspecified or undifferentiated cells that provide a source of renewal of skin, intestine, and blood cells throughout life. These resident stem cells have been identified in a variety of organs (e.g., epithelia of the skin and digestive system, bone marrow, blood vessels, brain, skeletal muscle, liver, testis, and pancreas) based on their specific locations, morphology, and biochemical markers.

Isolated Stem Cells

Unequivocal identification of stem cells requires their separation and purification, usually based on a combination of specific cell-surface markers. These isolated stem cells [e.g., hematopoietic stem (HS) cells] can be studied in detail and used in clinical applications, such as bone marrow transplantation (Chap. 66). However, the lack of specific cell-surface markers for other types of stem cells has made it difficult to isolate them in large quantities. This challenge has been partially addressed in animal models by genetically marking different cell types with green-fluorescence protein driven by cell-specific promoters. Alternatively, putative stem cells have been isolated from a variety of tissues as side population (SP) cells using fluorescence-activated cell sorting after staining with Hoechst 33342 dye.

Cultured Stem Cells

It is desirable to culture and expand stem cells in vitro to obtain a sufficient quantity for analysis and potential therapeutic use. Although the derivation of stem cells in vitro has been a major obstacle in stem cell biology, the number and types of cultured stem cells have increased progressively (Table 65每1). Cultured stem cells derived from resident stem cells are often called adult stem cells to distinguish them from embryonic stem (ES) and embryonic germ (EG) cells. However, considering the existence of embryo-derived, tissue-specific stem cells [e.g., trophoblast stem (TS) cells] and the possible derivation of similar cells from an embryo/fetus [e.g., neural stem (NS) cells], it is more appropriate to use the term, tissue stem cells.

Table 65每1 Classification of Cultured Stem Cells

 
 
Name Source Properties 
Embryonic stem cells (ES, ESC) Blastocysts or immuno-surgically isolated inner cell mass (ICM) from blastocysts. ES cells grow as tightly adherent multicellular colonies with a population doubling time of ~12 h, maintain a stable euploid karyotype even after extensive culture and manipulation, can differentiate into a variety of cell types in vitro, and can contribute to all cell types, including functional sperm and oocytes, when injected into a blastocyst (m). ES cells form relatively flat, compact colonies with a population doubling time of 35每40 h (h).  
Embryonic germ cells (EG, EGC) Primordial germ cells (PGCs) from embryos at E8.5每E12.5 (m). Gonadal tissues from 5每11 week post-fertilization embryo/fetus (h). EG cells show essentially the same pluripotency as ES cells when injected into mouse blastocysts (m). The only known difference is the imprinting status of some genes (e.g., Igf2r): Imprinting is normally erased during germline development, and thus, the imprinting status of EG cells is different from that of ES cells. 
Trophoblast stem cells (TS, TSC) Trophectoderm of E3.5 blastocysts, extraembryonic ectoderm of E6.5 embryos, and chorionic ectoderm of E7.5 embryos. TS cells can differentiate into trophoblast giant cells in vitro (m). TS can contribute exclusively to all trophoblast subtypes when injected into blastocysts (m).  
Extraembryonic endoderm cells (XEN) ICM from blastocysts XEN cells can contribute only to the parietal endoderm lineage when injected into a blastocyst (m). 
Embryonal carcinoma cells (EC) Teratocarcinoma〞a type of cancer that develops in the testes and ovaries EC cells rarely show pluripotency in vitro, but they can contribute to nearly all cell types when injected into blastocysts (m). EC cells often have an aneuploid karyotype and other genome alterations (m, h). 
Mesenchymal stem cells (MS, MSC) Bone marrow, muscle, adipose tissue, peripheral blood, and umbilical cord blood (m, h) MS cells can differentiate into mesenchymal cell types, including adipocytes, osteocytes, chondrocytes, and myocytes (m, h). 
Multipotent adult stem cells (MAPC) Bone marrow mononuclear cells (m, h); postnatal muscle and brain (m) MAPCs are very rare cells that are present within MSC cultures from postnatal bone marrow (m, h). MAPCs can be cultured for >120 population doublings, can differentiate into all tissues in vivo when injected into a mouse blastocyst, and can differentiate into various cell lineages of mesodermal, ectodermal, and endodermal origin in vitro (m).  
Spermatogonial stem cells (SS, SSC) Newborn testis (m) SS cells can reconstitute long-term spermatogenesis after transplantation into recipient testes and restore fertility (m). 
Germline stem cells (GS, GSC) Neonatal testis (m) GS cells can differentiate into three germlayers in vitro and contribute to a variety of tissues, including germline, when injected into blastocysts (m).  
Multipotent adult germline stem cells (maGSC) Adult testis (m) maGSC can differentiate into three germlayers in vitro and can contribute to a variety of tissues, including germline, when injected into blastocysts.  
Neural stem cells (NS, NSC) Fetal and adult brain (subventricular zone, ventricular zone, and hippocampus) NS cells can be cultured as a heterogeneous cell population of monolayer or floating cell clusters called neurospheres. NS cells can differentiate into neuron and glia in vivo and in vitro. Recently, the culture of pure population of symmetrically dividing adherent NS cells became possible.  
Unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSC) Mononuclear fraction of cord blood (h) USSCs can differentiate into a variety of cell types in vitro and can contribute a variety of cells types in in vivo transplantation experiments in rat, mouse, and sheep (h). USSCs are CD45每 adherent cells and can be expanded to 1015 cells without losing pluripotency (h).
  
Epistem cells (EpiSC) Early postimplantation epiblast (m) EpiSCs can differentiate into three germlayers in vitro and form teratomas but cannot contribute to normal tissues when injected into blastocysts (m). EpiSCs (m) are shown to be more similar to ESC (h) than ESC (m).  
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS, iPSC) Variety of terminally differentiated cells and tissue stem cells (m, h) ESC-like cells originally derived by introducing four transcription factors (Klf4, Pou5f1/Oct4, Sox2, and Myc) into mouse embryo fibroblasts by retroviral vectors (m). iPS cells are essentially indistinguishable from ES cells. A number of somatic cell types can be converted into iPS cells using different combinations of transcription factors and treatment with small molecules. 
 


Abbreviations: m, mouse; h, human.
 

Successful derivation of cultured stem cells (both embryonic and tissue stem cells) often requires the identification of necessary growth factors and culture conditions, mimicking the microenvironment or niche of the resident stem cells. For example, the derivation of mouse TS cells, once considered impossible, became feasible by using FGF4, a ligand expressed by adjacent cells in the developing trophoblast in vivo. Therefore, it may be possible to culture other resident stem cells (e.g., intestinal stem cells) or isolated stem cells (e.g., HS cells) by studying the factors that constitute their normal niche.

Self-Renewal and Proliferation of Stem Cells

Symmetric and Asymmetric Cell Division

The most widely accepted stem cell definition is a cell with a unique capacity to produce unaltered daughter cells (self-renewal) and to generate specialized cell types (potency). Self-renewal can be achieved in two ways. Asymmetric cell division produces one daughter cell that is identical to the parental cell and one daughter cell that is different from the parental cell and is a progenitor or differentiated cell. Asymmetric cell division does not increase the number of stem cells. Symmetric cell division produces two identical daughter cells. For stem cells to proliferate in vitro, they must divide symmetrically.

Unlimited Expansion In Vitro

Resident stem cells are often quiescent and divide infrequently. However, once the stem cells are successfully cultured in vitro, they often acquire the capacity to divide continuously and the ability to proliferate beyond the normal passage limit typical of primary cultured cells (sometimes called immortality). These features are primarily seen in ES cells but have also been demonstrated for NS cells, MS cells, MAPCs, maGSCs (adult-derived tissue stem cells), and USSCs (newborn-derived tissue stem cells), thereby enhancing the potential of these cells for therapeutic use (Table 65每1).

Stability of Genotype and Phenotype

The capacity to actively proliferate is often associated with the accumulation of chromosomal abnormalities and mutations. Mouse ES cells appear to be an exception to this rule and tend to maintain their euploid karyotype and genome integrity. By contrast, human ES cells appear to be more susceptible to mutations after long-term culture. However, it is also important to note that even euploid mouse ES cells can form teratomas when injected into immuno-suppressed animals, raising concerns about the possible formation of tumors after transplanting actively dividing stem cells.

Potency and Differentiation of Stem Cells

Developmental Potency

The term potency is used to indicate a cell's ability to differentiate into specialized cell types. The current lack of knowledge about the molecular nature of potency requires the experimental manipulation of stem cells to demonstrate their potency. For example, in vivo testing can be done by injecting stem cells into mouse blastocysts or immunosuppressed adult mice and determining how many different cell types are formed from the injected cells. In vitro testing can be done by differentiating cells in various culture conditions to determine how many different cell types are formed from the cells. However, these in vivo assays are not applicable to human stem cells. The formal test of self-renewal and potency is performed by demonstrating that a single cell possesses such abilities in vitro (clonality). Cultured stem cells are tentatively grouped according to their potency (Fig. 65-1).

From Totipotency to Unipotency

Totipotent cells can form an entire organism autonomously. Only a fertilized egg (zygote) possesses this feature. Pluripotent cells (e.g., ES cells) can form almost all of the body's cell lineages (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm), including germ cells. Multipotent cells (e.g., HS cells) can form multiple cell lineages but cannot form all of the body's cell lineages. Oligopotent cells (e.g., NS cells) can form more than one cell lineage but are more restricted than multipotent cells. Oligopotent cells are sometimes called progenitor cells or precursor cells; however, these terms are often more strictly used to define partially differentiated or lineage-committed cells (e.g., myeloid progenitor cells) that can divide into different cell types but lack self-renewing capacity. Unipotent cells or monopotent cells [e.g., spermatogonial stem (SS) cells] can form a single differentiated cell lineage. Terminally differentiated cells, such as fibroblasts, also have a capacity to proliferate (which may be called self-renewal) but maintain the same cell type (i.e., they have no ability to form another cell type) and are not, therefore, considered unipotent cells.

Nuclear Reprogramming

Development naturally progresses from totipotent fertilized eggs to pluripotent epiblast cells to multipotent cells and, finally, to terminally differentiated cells. According to Waddington's epigenetic landscape, this is analogous to a ball moving down a slope. The reversal of the terminally differentiated cells to totipotent or pluripotent cells (called nuclear reprogramming) can thus be seen as an uphill gradient that never occurs in normal conditions. However, nuclear reprogramming has been achieved using nuclear transplantation, or nuclear transfer (NT), procedures (often called "cloning"), where the nucleus of a differentiated cell is transferred into an enucleated oocyte. Although this is an error-prone procedure with a very low success rate, live animals have been produced using adult somatic cells as donors in sheep, mice, and other mammals. In mice, it has been demonstrated that ES cells derived from blastocysts made by somatic cell NT are indistinguishable from normal ES cells. NT can potentially be used to produce patient-specific ES cells carrying a genome identical to that of the patient. However, the successful implementation of this procedure has not been reported in humans. Setting aside technical and ethical issues, the limited supply of human oocytes will be a major problem for clinical applications of NT. Alternatively, successful nuclear reprogramming of somatic cells by fusing them with ES cells has been demonstrated in mice and humans. However, it is not yet clear how ES-derived DNA can be removed from hybrid cells.

An approach that has become increasingly successful is the direct conversion of terminally differentiated cells into ES-like cells [called induced pluripotent (iPS) cells] by transiently overexpressing a combination of key transcription factors (TFs). The original method was to infect mouse embryonic fibroblast cells with retrovirus vectors carrying four TFs [Pou5f1(Oct4), Sox2, Klf4, and Myc] and to identify rare ES-like cells in culture. It was soon adapted to human cells, followed by a more refined procedure (e.g., the use of fewer TFs, different cell types, and different gene-delivery methods). Use of protein cocktails and a variety of small molecules has also been actively pursued, as the goal is to produce patient-specific iPS cells without altering their genetic makeup.

Stem Cell Plasticity or Transdifferentiation

The prevailing paradigm in developmental biology is that once cells are differentiated, their phenotypes are stable. However, a number of reports have shown that tissue stem cells, which have traditionally been thought to be lineage-committed multipotent cells, possessing the capacity to differentiate into cell types outside their lineage restrictions (called transdifferentiation). For example, HS cells may be converted into neurons as well as germ cells. This feature may provide a means to use tissue stem cells derived directly from a patient for therapeutic purposes, thereby eliminating the need to use embryonic stem cells or elaborate procedures such as nuclear reprogramming of a patient's somatic cells. However, more strict criteria and rigorous validation are required to establish tissue stem cell plasticity. For example, observations of transdifferentiation may reflect cell fusion, contamination with progenitor cells from other cell lineages, or persistence of pluripotent embryonic cells in adult organs. Therefore, the assignment of potency to each cultured stem cell in Fig. 65-1 should be taken with caution. Whether transdifferentiation exists and can be used for therapeutic purposes remains to be determined conclusively.

Directed Differentiation of Stem Cells

Pluripotent stem cells (e.g., ES and iPS cells) can differentiate into multiple cell types, but in culture, they normally differentiate into heterogeneous cell populations in a stochastic manner. However, for therapeutic uses, it is desirable to direct stem cells into specific cell types (e.g., insulin-secreting beta cells). This is an active area of stem cell research, and protocols are being developed to achieve this goal. In any of these directed cell differentiation systems, the cell phenotype must be evaluated critically.

Molecular Characterization of Stem Cells

Genomics and Proteomics

In addition to standard molecular biological approaches, high-throughput genomics and proteomics have been extensively applied to the analysis of stem cells. For example, DNA microarray analyses have revealed the expression levels of essentially all genes and identified specific markers for some stem cells. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing technologies, capable of producing tens of millions of sequence reads in a single run, have revealed chromatin modifications ("epigenetic marks") relevant to stem cell properties. Similarly, the protein profiles of stem cells have been assessed by using mass spectrometry. These methods are beginning to provide a novel means to characterize and classify various stem cells and the molecular mechanisms that give them their unique characteristics.

Es Cell Regulation

It is important to identify genes involved in the regulation of stem cell function and to examine the effects of altered gene expression on ES and other stem cells. For example, core networks of TFs such as Pou5f1 (Oct4), Nanog, and Sox2, govern key gene regulatory pathways/networks for the maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency of mouse and human ES cells. These TF networks are modulated by specific external factors through signal transduction pathways, such as leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif)/Stat3, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/3 (Mapk1/3), TGF superfamily, and Wnt/glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (Gsk3b). Inhibitors of Mapk1/3 and Gsk3b signaling enhance the derivation of ES cells and help to maintain ES cells in a full pluripotency ("ground" or "naive state"). Recent data also indicate that 20每25 nucleotide RNAs, called microRNAs (miRNAs), play an important role in regulating stem cell function by repressing the translation of their target genes. For example, it has been shown that miR-21 regulates cell cycle progression in ES cells and miR-128 prevents the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. These types of analyses should provide molecular clues about the function of stem cells and lead to a more effective means to manipulate stem cells for future therapeutic use.

Hematopoietic Stem Cells: Introduction

All of the cell types in the peripheral blood and some cells in every tissue of the body are derived from hematopoietic (hemo: blood; poiesis: creation) stem cells. If the hematopoietic stem cell is damaged and can no longer function (e.g., due to a nuclear accident), a person would survive 2每4 weeks in the absence of extraordinary support measures. With the clinical use of hematopoietic stem cells, tens of thousands of lives are saved each year (Chap. 114). Stem cells produce tens of billions of blood cells daily from a stem cell pool that is estimated to be only in the hundreds of thousands. How stem cells do this, how they persist for many decades despite the production demands, and how they may be better used in clinical care are important issues in medicine.

The study of blood cell production has become a paradigm for how other tissues may be organized and regulated. Basic research in hematopoiesis that includes defining stepwise molecular changes accompanying functional changes in maturing cells, aggregating cells into functional subgroups, and demonstrating hematopoietic stem cell regulation by a specialized microenvironment are concepts worked out in hematology, but they offer models for other tissues. Moreover, these concepts may not be restricted to normal tissue function but extend to malignancy. Stem cells are rare cells among a heterogeneous population of cell types, and their behavior is assessed mainly in experimental animal models involving reconstitution of hematopoiesis. Thus, much of what we know about stem cells is imprecise and based on inferences from genetically manipulated animals.
 
Cardinal Functions of Hematopoietic Stem Cells

All stem cell types have two cardinal functions: self-renewal and differentiation (Fig. 66-1). Stem cells exist to generate, maintain, and repair tissues. They function successfully if they can replace a wide variety of shorter-lived mature cells over prolonged periods. The process of self-renewal (see below) assures that a stem cell population can be sustained over time. Without self-renewal, the stem cell pool would become exhausted and tissue maintenance would not be possible. The process of differentiation leads to production of the effectors of tissue function: mature cells. Without proper differentiation, the integrity of tissue function would be compromised and organ failure would ensue.

Figure 66-1

 
 
 
Signature characteristics of the stem cell. Stem cells have two essential features: the capacity to differentiate into a variety of mature cell types and the capacity for self-renewal. Intrinsic factors associated with self-renewal include expression of Bmi-1, Gfi-1, PTEN, STAT5, Tel/Atv6, p21, p18, MCL-1, Mel-18, RAE28, and HoxB4. Extrinsic signals for self-renewal include Notch, Wnt, SHH, and Tie2/Ang-1. Based mainly on murine studies, hematopoietic stem cells express the following cell surface molecules: CD34, Thy-1 (CD90), c-Kit receptor (CD117), CD133, CD164, and c-Mpl (CD110, also known as the thrombopoietin receptor).
 
 

In the blood, mature cells have variable average life spans, ranging from 7 h for mature neutrophils to a few months for red blood cells to many years for memory lymphocytes. However, the stem cell pool is the central, durable source of all blood and immune cells, maintaining a capacity to produce a broad range of cells from a single cell source, yet keeping itself vigorous over decades of life. As an individual stem cell divides, it has the capacity to accomplish one of three division outcomes: two stem cells, two cells destined for differentiation, or one stem cell and one differentiating cell. The former two outcomes are the result of symmetric cell division, whereas the latter indicates a different outcome for the two daughter cells〞an event termed asymmetric cell division. The relative balance for these types of outcomes may change during development and under particular kinds of demands on the stem cell pool.

Developmental Biology of Hematopoietic Stem Cells

During development, blood cells are produced at different sites. Initially, the yolk sac provides oxygen-carrying red blood cells, and then the placenta and several sites of intraembryonic blood cell production become involved. These intraembryonic sites engage in sequential order, moving from the genital ridge at a site where the aorta, gonadal tissue, and mesonephros are emerging to the fetal liver and then, in the second trimester, to the bone marrow and spleen. As the location of stem cells changes, the cells they produce also change. The yolk sac provides red cells expressing embryonic hemoglobins while intraembryonic sites of hematopoiesis generate red cells, platelets, and the cells of innate immunity. The production of the cells of adaptive immunity occurs when the bone marrow is colonized and the thymus forms. Stem cell proliferation remains high, even in the bone marrow, until shortly after birth, when it appears to dramatically decline. The cells in the bone marrow are thought to arrive by the bloodborne transit of cells from the fetal liver after calcification of the long bones has begun. The presence of stem cells in the circulation is not unique to a time window in development. Rather, hematopoietic stem cells appear to circulate throughout life. The time that cells spend freely circulating appears to be brief (measured in minutes in the mouse), but the cells that do circulate are functional and can be used for transplantation. The number of stem cells that circulate can be increased in a number of ways to facilitate harvest and transfer to the same or a different host.

Mobility of Hematopoietic Stem Cells

Cells entering and exiting the bone marrow do so through a series of molecular interactions. Circulating stem cells (through CD162 and CD44) engage the lectins P- and E-selectin on the endothelial surface to slow the movement of the cells to a rolling phenotype. Stem cell integrins are then activated and accomplish firm adhesion between the stem cell and vessel wall, with a particularly important role for stem cell VCAM-1 engaging endothelial VLA-4. The chemokine CXCL12 (SDF1) interacting with stem cell CXCR4 receptors also appears to be important in the process of stem cells getting from the circulation to where they engraft in the bone marrow. This is particularly true in the developmental move from fetal liver to bone marrow; however, the role for this molecule in adults appears to be more related to retention of stem cells in the bone marrow rather the process of getting them there. Interrupting that retention process through either specific molecular blockers of the CXCR4/CXCL12 interaction, cleavage of CXCL12, or downregulation of the receptor can all result in the release of stem cells into the circulation. This process is an increasingly important aspect of recovering stem cells for therapeutic use as it has permitted the harvesting process to be done by leukapheresis rather than bone marrow punctures in the operating room. Refining our knowledge of how stem cells get into and out of the bone marrow may improve our ability to obtain stem cells and make them more efficient at finding their way to the specific sites for blood cell production, the so-called stem cell niche.

Hematopoietic Stem Cell Microenvironment

The concept of a specialized microenvironment, or stem cell niche, was first proposed to explain why cells derived from the bone marrow of one animal could be used in transplantation and again be found in the bone marrow of the recipient. This niche is more than just a housing site for stem cells, however. It is an anatomic location where regulatory signals are provided that allow the stem cells to thrive, to expand if needed, and to provide varying amounts of descendant daughter cells. In addition, unregulated growth of stem cells may be problematic based on their undifferentiated state and self-renewal capacity. Thus, the niche must also regulate the number of stem cells produced. In this manner, the niche has the dual function of serving as a site of nurture but imposing limits for stem cells: in effect, acting as both a nutritive and constraining home.

The niche for blood stem cells changes with each of the sites of blood production during development, but for most of human life it is located in the bone marrow. Within the bone marrow, at least two niche sites have been proposed: on trabecular bone surfaces and in the perivascular space. Stem cells may be found in both places by histologic analysis, and functional regulation has been shown at the highly vascular bone surface. Specifically, bone-forming mesenchymal cells, osteoblastic cells, participate in hematopoietic stem cell function, affecting their location, proliferation, and number. The basis for this interaction is through a number of molecules mediating location, such as the chemokine CXCL12 (SDF1), through proliferation signals mediated by angiopoietin 1, and signaling to modulate self-renewal or survival by factors such as Notch ligands, kit ligand, and Wnts. Other bone components, such as the extracellular matrix glycoprotein, osteopontin, and the high ionic calcium found at trabecular surfaces, contribute to the unique microenvironment, or stem cell niche, on trabecular bone. This physiology has practical applications. First, medications altering niche components may have an effect on stem cell function. This has now been shown for a number of compounds, and some are being clinically tested. Second, it is now possible to assess whether the niche participates in disease states and to examine whether targeting the niche with medications may alter the outcome of certain diseases.

Excess Capacity of Hematopoietic Stem Cells

In the absence of disease, one never runs out of hematopoietic stem cells. Indeed, serial transplantation studies in mice suggest that sufficient stem cells are present to reconstitute several animals in succession, with each animal having normal blood cell production. The fact that allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients also never run out of blood cells in their life span, which can extend for decades, argues that even the limiting numbers of stem cells provided to them are sufficient. How stem cells respond to different conditions to increase or decrease their mature cell production remains poorly understood. Clearly, negative feedback mechanisms affect the level of production of most of the cells, leading to the normal tightly regulated blood cell counts. However, many of the regulatory mechanisms that govern production of more mature progenitor cells do not apply or apply differently to stem cells. Similarly, most of the molecules shown to be able to change the size of the stem cell pool have little effect on more mature blood cells. For example, the growth factor erythropoietin, which stimulates red blood cell production from more mature precursor cells, has no effect on stem cells. Similarly, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor drives the rapid proliferation of granulocyte precursors but has little or no effect on the cell cycling of stem cells. Rather, it changes the location of stem cells by indirect means, altering molecules such as CXCL12 that tether stem cells to their niche. Molecules shown to be important for altering the proliferation, self renewal or survival of stem cells, such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, transcription factors like Bmi-1, or microRNAs like miR125a, have little or different effects on progenitor cells. Hematopoietic stem cells have governing mechanisms that are distinct from the cells they generate.

Hematopoietic Stem Cell Differentiation

Hematopoietic stem cells sit at the base of a branching hierarchy of cells culminating in the many mature cell types that compose the blood and immune system (Fig. 66-2). The maturation steps leading to terminally differentiated and functional blood cells take place both as a consequence of intrinsic changes in gene expression and niche-directed and cytokine-directed changes in the cells. Our knowledge of the details remains incomplete. As stem cells mature to progenitors, precursors, and, finally, mature effector cells, they undergo a series of functional changes. These include the obvious acquisition of functions defining mature blood cells, such as phagocytic capacity or hemoglobin synthesis. They also include the progressive loss of plasticity (i.e., the ability to become other cell types). For example, the myeloid progenitor can make all cells in the myeloid series but none in the lymphoid series. As common myeloid progenitors mature, they become precursors for either monocytes and granulocytes or erythrocytes and megakaryocytes, but not both. Some amount of reversibility of this process may exist early in the differentiation cascade, but that is lost beyond a distinct stage. As cells differentiate, they may also lose proliferative capacity (Fig. 66-3). Mature granulocytes are incapable of proliferation and only increase in number by increased production from precursors. Lymphoid cells retain the capacity to proliferate but have linked their proliferation to the recognition of particular proteins or peptides by specific antigen receptors on their surface. In most tissues the proliferative cell population is a more immature progenitor population. In general, cells within the highly proliferative progenitor cell compartment are also relatively short-lived, making their way through the differentiation process in a defined molecular program involving the sequential activation of particular sets of genes. For any particular cell type, the differentiation program is difficult to speed up. The time it takes for hematopoietic progenitors to become mature cells is 10每14 days in humans, evident clinically by the interval between cytotoxic chemotherapy and blood count recovery in patients.

Hierarchy of hematopoietic differentiation.Stem cells are multipotent cells that are the source of all descendant cells and have the capacity to provide either long-term (measured in years) or short-term (measured in months) cell production. Progenitor cells have a more limited spectrum of cells they can produce and are generally a short-lived, highly proliferative population also known as transient amplifying cells. Precursor cells are cells committed to a single blood cell lineage but with a continued ability to proliferate; they do not have all the features of a fully mature cell. Mature cells are the terminally differentiated product of the differentiation process and are the effector cells of specific activities of the blood and immune system. Progress through the pathways is mediated by alterations in gene expression. The regulation of the differentiation by soluble factors and cell-cell communications within the bone marrow niche are still being defined. The transcription factors that characterize particular cell transitions are illustrated on the arrows; the soluble factors that contribute to the differentiation process are in blue. EPO, erythropoietin; SCF, stem cell factor; TPO, thrombopoietin.
 
 

Self-Renewal

The hematopoietic stem cell must balance its three potential fates: apoptosis, self-renewal, and differentiation. The proliferation of cells is generally not associated with the ability to undergo a self-renewing division except among memory T and B cells and among stem cells. Self-renewal capacity gives way to differentiation as the only option after cell division when cells leave the stem cell compartment, until they have the opportunity to become memory lymphocytes. In addition to this self-renewing capacity, stem cells have an additional feature characterizing their proliferation machinery. Stem cells in many mature adult tissues may be heterogeneous with some being deeply quiescent, serving as a deep reserve, while others are more proliferative and replenish the short-lived progenitor population. In the hematopoietic system, stem cells are generally cytokine-resistant, remaining dormant even when cytokines drive bone marrow progenitors to proliferation rates measured in hours. Stem cells, in contrast, are thought to divide at far longer intervals measured in months to years, for the most quiescent cells. This quiescence is difficult to overcome in vitro, limiting the ability to effectively expand human hematopoietic stem cells. The process may be controlled by particularly high levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors that restrict entry of stem cells into cell cycle, blocking the G1-S transition. Exogenous signals from the niche also appear to enforce quiescence, including the activation of the tyrosine kinase receptor Tie2 on stem cells by angiopoietin 1 on osteoblasts.

The regulation of stem cell proliferation also appears to change with age. In mice, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4a accumulates in stem cells in older animals and is associated with a change in five different stem cell functions, including cell cycling. Lowering expression of p16INK4a in older animals improves stem cell cycling and capacity to reconstitute hematopoiesis in adoptive hosts, making them similar to younger animals. Mature cell numbers are unaffected. Therefore, molecular events governing the specific functions of stem cells are being gradually made clear and offer the potential of new approaches to changing stem cell function for therapy. One critical stem cell function that remains poorly defined is the molecular regulation of self-renewal.

For medicine, self-renewal is perhaps the most important function of stem cells because it is critical in regulating the number of stem cells. Stem cell number is a key limiting parameter for both autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Were we to have the ability to use fewer stem cells or expand limited numbers of stem cells ex vivo, it might be possible to reduce the morbidity and expense of stem cell harvests and enable use of other stem cell sources. Specifically, umbilical cord blood is a rich source of stem cells. However, the volume of cord blood units is extremely small and, therefore, the total number of hematopoietic stem cells that can be obtained is generally only sufficient to transplant an individual of <40 kg. This limitation restricts what would otherwise be an extremely promising source of stem cells. Two features of cord blood stem cells are particularly important. (1) They are derived from a diversity of individuals that far exceeds the adult donor pool and therefore can overcome the majority of immunologic cross-matching obstacles. (2) Cord blood stem cells have a large number of T cells associated with them, but (paradoxically) they appear to be associated with a lower incidence of graft-versus-host disease when compared with similarly mismatched stem cells from other sources. If stem cell expansion by self-renewal could be achieved, the number of cells available might be sufficient for use in larger adults. An alternative approach to this problem is to improve the efficiency of engraftment of donor stem cells. Graft engineering is exploring methods of adding cell components that may enhance engraftment. Furthermore, at least some data suggest that depletion of host NK (natural killer) cells may lower the number of stem cells necessary to reconstitute hematopoiesis.

Some limited understanding of self-renewal exists and, intriguingly, implicates gene products that are associated with the chromatin state, a high-order organization of chromosomal DNA that influences transcription. These include members of the polycomb family, a group of zinc finger每containing transcriptional regulators that interact with the chromatin structure, contributing to the accessibility of groups of genes for transcription. One member, Bmi-1, is important in enabling hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal through modification of cell cycle regulators such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. In the absence of Bmi-1 or of the transcriptional regulator, Gfi-1, hematopoietic stem cells decline in number and function. In contrast, dysregulation of Bmi-1 has been associated with leukemia; it may promote leukemic stem cell self-renewal when it is overexpressed. Other transcription regulators have also been associated with self-renewal, particularly homeobox, or "hox," genes. These transcription factors are named for their ability to govern large numbers of genes, including those determining body patterning in invertebrates. HoxB4 is capable of inducing extensive self-renewal of stem cells through its DNA-binding motif. Other members of the hox family of genes have been noted to affect normal stem cells, but they are also associated with leukemia. External signals that may influence the relative self-renewal versus differentiation outcomes of stem cell cycling include the Notch ligands and specific Wnt ligands. Intracellular signal transducing intermediates are also implicated in regulating self-renewal but, interestingly, are not usually associated with the pathways activated by Notch or Wnt receptors. They include PTEN, an inhibitor of the AKT pathway, and STAT5, both of which are usually downstream of activated growth factor receptors and necessary for normal stem cell functions including self-renewal, at least in mouse models. The connections between these molecules remain to be defined, and their role in physiologic regulation of stem cell self-renewal is still poorly understood.
 
Cancer Is Similar to an Organ with Self-Renewing Capacity

The relationship of stem cells to cancer is an important evolving dimension of adult stem cell biology. Cancer may share principles of organization with normal tissues. Cancer might have the same hierarchical organization of cells with a base of stem-like cells capable of the signature stem-cell features, self-renewal, and differentiation. These stem-like cells might be the basis for perpetuation of the tumor and represent a slowly dividing, rare population with distinct regulatory mechanisms, including a relationship with a specialized microenvironment. A subpopulation of self-renewing cells has been defined for some, but not all, cancers. A more sophisticated understanding of the stem-cell organization of cancers may lead to improved strategies for developing new therapies for the many common and difficult-to-treat types of malignancies that have been relatively refractory to interventions aimed at dividing cells.

Does the concept of cancer stem cells provide insight into the cellular origin of cancer? The fact that some cells within a cancer have stem cell每like properties does not necessarily mean that the cancer arose in the stem cell itself. Rather, more mature cells could have acquired the self-renewal characteristics of stem cells. Any single genetic event is unlikely to be sufficient to enable full transformation of a normal cell to a frankly malignant one. Rather, cancer is a multistep process, and for the multiple steps to accumulate, the cell of origin must be able to persist for prolonged periods. It must also be able to generate large numbers of daughter cells. The normal stem cell has these properties and, by virtue of its having intrinsic self-renewal capability, may be more readily converted to a malignant phenotype. This hypothesis has been tested experimentally in the hematopoietic system. Taking advantage of the cell-surface markers that distinguish hematopoietic cells of varying maturity, stem cells, progenitors, precursors, and mature cells can be isolated. Powerful transforming gene constructs were placed in these cells, and it was found that the cell with the greatest potential to produce a malignancy was dependent on the transforming gene. In some cases it was the stem cell, but in others, the progenitor cell functioned to initiate and per-petuate the cancer. This shows that cells can acquire stem cell-like properties in malignancy.
 
What Else Can Hematopoietic Stem Cells Do?

Some experimental data have suggested that hematopoietic stem cells or other cells mobilized into the circulation by the same factors that mobilize hematopoietic stem cells are capable of playing a role in healing the vascular and tissue damage associated with stroke and myocardial infarction. These data are controversial, and the applicability of a stem-cell approach to nonhematopoietic conditions remains experimental. However, the application of the evolving knowledge of hematopoietic stem cell biology may lead to wide-ranging clinical uses.

The stem cell, therefore, represents a true dual-edged sword. It has tremendous healing capacity and is essential for life. Uncontrolled, it can threaten the life it maintains. Understanding how stem cells function, the signals that modify their behavior, and the tissue niches that modulate stem cell responses to injury and disease are critical for more effectively developing stem cell每based medicine. That aspect of medicine will include the use of the stem cells and the use of drugs to target stem cells to enhance repair of damaged tissues. It will also include the careful balance of interventions to control stem cells where they may be dysfunctional or malignant.

 Applications of Stem Cell Biology in Clinical Medicine: Introduction

Damage to an organ initiates a series of events that lead to the reconstruction of the damaged tissue, including proliferation, differentiation and migration of various cell types, release of cytokines and chemokines, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Endogenous stem and progenitor cells are among the cell populations that are involved in the injury responses. In normal steady-state conditions, an equilibrium is maintained in which endogenous stem cells intrinsic to the tissue replenish dying cells. After tissue injury, stem cells in organs, such as the liver and skin, have a remarkable ability to regenerate the organ, whereas other stem cell populations, such as those in the heart and brain, have a much more limited capability for self-repair. In rare circumstances, circulating stem cells may contribute to regenerative responses by migrating into a tissue and differentiating into organ-specific cell types. The goal of stem cell therapies is to promote cell replacement in organs that are damaged beyond their ability for self-repair.
 
General Strategies for Stem Cell Replacement

At least three different therapeutic concepts for cell replacement can be envisaged (Fig. 67-1). One therapeutic approach involves direct administration of stem cells. This may involve injection of the cells directly into the damaged organ, where they can differentiate into the desired cell type. Alternatively, stem cells may be injected systemically since they have the capacity to home in on damaged tissues by following gradients of cytokines and chemokines released by the diseased organ. A second approach involves transplantation of differentiated cells derived from stem cells. For example, pancreatic islet cells would be generated from stem cells before transplantation into diabetic patients and cardiomyocytes would be generated to treat ischemic heart disease. A third approach involves stimulation of endogenous stem cells to facilitate repair. This might be accomplished by administration of appropriate growth factors and drugs that amplify the number of endogenous stem/progenitor cells and/or direct them to differentiate into the desired cell types. Therapeutic stimulation of precursor cells is already a clinical reality in the hematopoietic system, where factors such as erythropoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are used to increase production of specific blood elements. In addition to these strategies for cell replacement, a number of other approaches could involve stem cells for ex vivo or in situ generation of tissues, a process termed tissue engineering (Chap. 69). Stem cells are also excellent candidates as vehicles for cellular gene therapy (Chap. 68). Finally, transplanted stem cells may exert paracrine effects on damaged tissues without differentiating and replacing lost cells.

Stem cells may be -differentiated ex vivo before injection into the target organ. 3. Growth factors or other drugs may be injected to stimulate endogenous stem cell -populations.
 
 

Stem cell transplantation is not a new concept and is already part of established medical practice. Hematopoietic stem cells (Chap. 66) are responsible for the long-term repopulation of all blood elements in recipients of bone marrow transplants, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the gold standard against which other stem cell transplantation therapies will be measured. Transplantation of differentiated cells is also a clinical reality, and donated organs and tissues often are used to replace damaged tissues. However, the need for transplantable tissues and organs far outweighs the available supply, and organ transplantation has limited potential for some tissues, such as the brain. Stem cells offer the possibility of a renewable source of replacement cells for virtually all organs.
 
Sources of Stem Cells for Tissue Repair

A variety of different types of stem cells (Chap. 65) could be used in regenerative strategies, including embryonic stem (ES) cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells), umbilical cord blood stem cells, organ-specific somatic stem cells (e.g., neural stem cells for treatment of the brain), and somatic stem cells that generate cell types specific for the target organ rather than the donor organ (e.g., bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells for cardiac repair). Each cell type has potential advantages and disadvantages, and there are a number of generic problems in developing any of these cell types into a useful and reliable clinical tool.

Embryonic Stem Cells

Embryonic stem cells have the potential to generate all the cell types in the body, and so in theory there are no restrictions on the organs that could be regenerated. They can self-renew endlessly so that a single cell line with carefully characterized traits potentially could generate almost limitless numbers of cells. In the absence of moral or ethical constraints, unused human blastocysts from fertility clinics could be used to derive new ES cell lines that are matched immunologically with potential transplant recipients. Alternatively, somatic cell nuclear transfer ("therapeutic cloning") could be used to create ES cell lines that are genetically identical to those of the patient. However, human ES cells are difficult to culture and grow slowly. Techniques for differentiating them into specific cell types are just beginning to be developed. Cells tend to develop abnormal karyotypes and other abnormalities with increased time in culture, and ES cells have the potential to form teratomas if all cells are not committed to the desired cell types before transplantation. Further, human ES cells are ethically controversial and, on these grounds, would be unacceptable to some patients and physicians despite their therapeutic potential.

Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells

The field of stem cell biology was transformed by the discovery that adult somatic cells can be converted ("reprogrammed") into pluripotent cells by overexpressing four transcription factors normally expressed in pluripotent cells (Chap. 65). These iPS cells share most properties with ES cells, although there are distinct differences in gene expression between ES and iPS cells. Viruses were used initially to insert the transcription factors into somatic cells, making them unsuitable for clinical use. However, a number of strategies have been developed to circumvent this problem, including the insertion of proteins rather than cDNAs; insertion of transposons with the programming factors, followed by their subsequent removal; and use of floxed viral constructs followed by Cre recombinase to excise the viral constructs. None of these approaches is sufficiently developed for cells to be used clinically, but appropriate techniques are likely to evolve quickly. The potential advantages of such cells are that use of somatic cells from patients would generate iPS cells genetically identical to those of the patient and that the cells do not have the same ethical constraints as ES cells. It is not clear whether the differences in gene expression between ES and iPS cells will have any impact on their potential clinical utility, and studies of both cell types will be essential to resolve this issue.

Umbilical Cord Stem Cells

Umbilical cord blood stem/progenitor cells are widely and easily available, and they appear to be associated with less graft-versus-host disease than are some other cell types, such as marrow stem cells. They have less human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restriction than adult marrow stem cells and are less likely to be contaminated with herpesvirus. However, it is unclear how many different cell types can be generated from umbilical cord blood stem cells, and methods for differentiating these cells into nonhematopoietic phenotypes are largely lacking. Further, the quantity of obtainable cells may be limiting.

Organ-Specific Multipotent Stem Cells

Organ-specific multipotent stem cells have the advantage that they are already somewhat specialized and inducement of desired cell types thus may be easier. Cells potentially could be obtained from the patient and amplified in cell culture, circumventing the problems associated with immune rejection. Stem cells are relatively easy to harvest from some tissues, such as bone marrow and blood, but difficult in the case of other tissues, such as heart and brain. However, these populations of cells are more limited in potentiality than are pluripotent ES or iPS cells, and they may be difficult to obtain in large quantities from many organs. Therefore, substantial efforts have been devoted to developing techniques for using more easily obtainable stem cell populations, such as bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and adipose stem cells, for use in regenerative strategies. Tissue culture evidence suggests that these stem cell populations may be able to generate differentiated cell types unrelated to their organ source, including myocytes, chondrocytes, tendon cells, osteoblasts, cardiomyocytes, adipocytes, hepatocytes, and neurons, a process known as transdifferentiation. However, it is still unclear whether these stem cells are capable of generating differentiated cell types that integrate into organs, survive, and function after transplantation in vivo. A number of early studies of bone marrow每derived stem cells transplanted into heart, liver, and other organs suggested that the cells had differentiated into organ-specific cell types. Subsequent studies, however, revealed that the stem cells had simply fused with cells resident in the organs. Further studies will be necessary to determine whether transdifferentiation of MSCs, adipose stem cells, or other stem cell populations occurs at a high enough frequency to be useful for stem cell replacement therapy.

Regardless of the source of the stem cell used in regenerative strategies, there are a number of generic problems that must be overcome for the development of successful clinical applications. These problems include development of methods for reliably generating large numbers of specific cell types, minimizing the risk of tumor formation or proliferation of inappropriate cell types, ensuring the viability and function of the engrafted cells, overcoming the problems of immune rejection when autografts are not used, and facilitating revascularization of the regenerated tissue. Each organ system will also pose tissue-specific problems for stem cell therapies.
 
Disease-Specific Applications of Stem Cells

Ischemic Heart Disease and Cardiomyocyte Regeneration

Because of the prevalence of ischemic heart disease, extensive efforts have been devoted to the development of strategies for cell replacement of cardiomyocytes. Historically, the adult heart has been viewed as a terminally differentiated organ without the capacity for regeneration. However, recent studies have demonstrated that the heart has the ability to achieve low levels of cardiomyocyte regeneration (Chap. 224). This regeneration appears to be accomplished by cardiac stem cells resident in the heart and possibly by cells originating in the bone marrow. Cardiac stem cells might be an ideal source for therapeutic use, but techniques for isolating, characterizing, and amplifying large numbers of these cells have not been perfected. To effect myocardial repair, stem cell therapy must deliver cells either systemically or locally, and the cells must survive, engraft, and differentiate into functional cardiomyocytes that couple mechanically and electrically with the recipient myocardium. The optimal method for cell delivery is not clear, and various experimental and clinical studies have successfully employed intramyocardial, transendocardial, intravenous, and intracoronary injections. In experimental myocardial infarction, functional improvements have been achieved after transplantation of a variety of different cell types, including ES cells, bone marrow stem cells, endothelial stem cells, and adipose stem cells. Early studies suggested that each of these cell types might have the potential to engraft and generate cardiomyocytes. However, most investigators have found that the generation of new cardiomyocytes by these cells is at best a rare event and that graft survival over long periods is poor. The preponderance of evidence suggests that the beneficial effects of most experimental therapies were not derived from direct stem cell generation of cardiomyocytes but rather from indirect effects of the stem cells on resident cells. It is not clear whether this reflects the release of soluble growth factors, induction of angiogenesis, or another mechanism. The ready availability of bone marrow stem cells facilitated a series of limited clinical trials in human ischemic heart disease. A wide variety of cell delivery methods, cell types, and doses of cells have been used in the various studies, and the fate of the cells and the mechanisms by which they altered cardiac function are open questions. In aggregate, however, these studies have shown a small but measurable improvement in cardiac function and, in some cases, reduction in infarct size. The limited available evidence suggests that the beneficial effects probably reflect an indirect effect of the transplanted cells rather than genuine cell replacement.

Diabetes

Successes with islet cell and pancreas transplantation have provided proof of the concept for cell-based therapies for type 1 diabetes. However, the demand for donor pancreases far exceeds the number available, and maintenance of long-term graft survival is a problem. The search for a renewable source of stem cells capable of regenerating pancreatic islets has therefore been intensive. Pancreatic beta cell turnover occurs even in the normal pancreas, although the source of the new beta cells remains controversial. This suggests that in principle, it should be possible to develop strategies for reconstituting the beta cell population in diabetics. Attempts to devise techniques for promoting endogenous regenerative processes by using combinations of growth factors, drugs, and gene therapy have failed thus far, but this remains a potentially viable approach. A number of different cell types are candidates for use in stem cell replacement strategies, including iPS cells, ES cells, hepatic progenitor cells, pancreatic ductal progenitor cells, and bone marrow stem cells. Successful therapy will depend on the development of a source of cells that can be amplified to produce large numbers of progeny that have the ability to synthesize, store, and release insulin when it is required, primarily in response to changes in the ambient level of glucose. The proliferative capacity of the replacement cells must be tightly regulated to avoid excessive expansion of beta cell numbers with the consequent development of hyperinsulinemia/hypoglycemia, and the cells must withstand immune rejection. Although it has been reported that ES and iPS cells can be differentiated into cells that produce insulin, these cells have a low content of insulin and a high rate of apoptosis and generally lack the capacity to normalize blood glucose in diabetic animals. Thus, ES and iPS cells have not been useful for the large-scale production of differentiated islet cells. During embryogenesis, the pancreas, liver, and gastrointestinal tract are all derived from the anterior endoderm, and transdifferentiation of the pancreas to liver and vice versa has been observed in a number of pathologic conditions. There is also substantial evidence that multipotential stem cells reside within gastric glands and intestinal crypts. These observations suggest that hepatic, pancreatic and/or gastrointestinal precursor cells may be reasonable candidates for cell-based therapy for diabetes, although it is unclear whether insulin-producing cells derived from pancreatic stem cells or liver progenitors can be expanded in vitro to clinically useful numbers. Bone marrow stem cells and neural stem cells both reportedly have the capacity to generate insulin-producing cells, but there is no convincing evidence that either cell type will be clinically useful.

Nervous System

Substantial progress has been made in developing methodologies for generating neural cells from different stem cell populations. Human ES or iPS cells can be induced to generate cells with the properties of neural stem cells, and these cells in turn give rise to neurons, oligodendroglia, and astrocytes. Reasonably large numbers of these cells can be transplanted into the rodent brain with formation of appropriate cell types and no tumor formation. Multipotent stem cells present in the adult brain also can be easily amplified in number and used to generate all the major neural cell types, but the invasive procedures that would be necessary to obtain autologous cells are a major limitation. Fetal neural stem cells derived from miscarriages or abortions are an alternative but may raise ethical concerns. Nevertheless, a clinical trial of fetal neural stem cells in Batten's disease is in progress. Transdifferentiation of bone marrow and adipose stem cells into neural stem cells, and vice versa, has been reported by numerous investigators, and clinical trials of such cells have begun for a number of neurologic disorders. Clinical trials of a conditionally immortalized human cell line and of human umbilical cord blood cells in stroke are planned. Some evidence suggests that epidermal stem cells also have the potential for neural regeneration. Neurologic disorders that have been targeted for stem cell therapies include spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), stroke, traumatic brain injury, Batten's disease, and Parkinson's disease. In Parkinson's disease the major motor features of the disorder result from the loss of a single cell population〞dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra〞suggesting that cell replacement should be relatively straightforward. However, two clinical trials of fetal nigral transplantation failed to meet their primary endpoint and were complicated by the development of dyskinesia. Transplantation of stem cell每derived dopamine-producing cells offers a number of potential advantages over the fetal transplants, including the ability of stem cells to migrate and disperse within tissue, the potential for engineering regulatable release of dopamine, and the ability to engineer cells to produce factors that will enhance cell survival. Nevertheless, the experience with fetal transplants points out the difficulties that may be encountered.

At least some of the neurologic dysfunction after spinal cord injury reflects demyelination, and both ES cells and marrow-derived stem cells are able to facilitate remyelination after experimental spinal cord injury. Clinical trials of marrow-derived stem cells in this disorder have commenced in a number of countries, and this may be the first disease targeted for the clinical use of ES cells. Marrow-derived stem cells also are being used in the treatment of stroke, traumatic brain injury, and ALS, in which possible benefits are more likely to be due to indirect trophic effects or remyelination than to neuron replacement. At present no population of transplanted stem cells has been shown to have the capacity to generate neurons that extend axons over long distances to form synaptic connections (as would be necessary for replacement of upper motor neurons in ALS, stroke, or other disorders).

Liver

Liver transplantation is currently the only successful treatment for end-stage liver diseases, but the shortage of liver grafts is a serious problem. Clinical trials of hepatocyte transplantation demonstrate that it potentially can substitute for organ transplantation, but this approach is limited by the paucity of available cells. Potential sources of stem cells for regenerative strategies include endogenous liver stem cells (such as oval cells), ES cells, bone marrow cells, and umbilical cord blood cells. Although a series of studies in humans as well as animals suggested that transplanted bone marrow stem cells can generate hepatocytes, fusion of the transplanted cells with endogenous liver cells, giving the erroneous appearance of new hepatocytes, appears to be the underlying event in most circumstances. The available evidence suggests that transplanted hematopoietic cells can generate hepatocyte-like cells in the liver only at a very low frequency. ES cells can be differentiated into hepatocytes and transplanted in animal models of liver failure without the formation of teratomas.

Other Organ Systems and the Future

The use of stem cells in regenerative strategies has been studied for many other organ systems and cell types, including skin, eye, cartilage, bone, kidney, lung, endometrium, vascular endothelium, smooth muscle, and striated muscle, among others. In fact, the potential for stem cell regeneration of damaged organs and tissues is virtually limitless. However, there are numerous obstacles to be overcome before stem cell therapies can become a widespread clinical reality. Only hematopoietic stem cells have been adequately characterized by surface markers so that they can be unambiguously identified, a prerequisite for reliable clinical applications. The pathways for differentiating stem cells into specific cellular phenotypes are largely unknown, and there is little ability at present to control the migration of transplanted cells or predict the response of the cells to the environment of diseased organs. Some strategies may employ the coadministration of scaffolding, artificial extracellular matrix, and/or growth factors to orchestrate differentiation of stem cells and their organization into appropriate constituents of the organ. There is currently no way to image stem cells in vivo after transplantation into humans, and it will be necessary to develop techniques to accomplish this. Fortunately, stem cells can be engineered before transplantation to contain a contrast agent that may make this feasible. The potential for tumor formation and the problems associated with immune rejection are impediments, and it will also be necessary to develop techniques for ensuring vascularization of regenerated tissues. There already are many strategies for cell replacement, including vasoactive endothelial growth factor (VEGF) coadministration to foster vascularization of the transplant. Some strategies also include genetically engineering stem cells to have an inducible suicide gene so that the cells can be easily eradicated in the event of tumor formation or another complication. The potential for stem cell therapies to revolutionize medical care is extraordinary, and disorders such as myocardial infarction, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease, among many others, will become potentially curable. However, such stem cell每based therapies are still at a very early stage of development, and perfection of techniques for clinical transplantation of predictable, well-characterized cells is going to be a difficult and lengthy undertaking.

Ethical Issues

Stem cell therapies raise ethical and socially contentious issues that must be addressed in parallel with the scientific and medical opportunities. This society has great diversity with respect to religious beliefs, concepts of individual rights, tolerance for uncertainty and risk, and boundaries for how scientific interventions should be used to alter the outcome of disease. In the United States, the federal government has authorized research using existing human ES cell lines but still restricts the use of federal funds for developing new human ES cell lines. Ongoing studies of existing lines have indicated that they develop abnormalities with time in culture and that they may be contaminated with mouse proteins. These findings point out the need to develop new human ES cell lines. The development of iPS cell technology may lessen the need for deriving new ES cell lines, but it is still not clear whether the differences in gene expression by ES and iPS cells are important for potential clinical use.

In considering ethical issues associated with the use of stem cells, it is helpful to draw from experience with other scientific advances, such as organ transplantation, recombinant DNA technology, implantation of mechanical devices, neuroscience and cognitive research, in vitro fertilization, and prenatal genetic testing. These and other precedents have pointed to the importance of understanding and testing fundamental biology in the laboratory setting and in animal models before applying new techniques in carefully controlled clinical trials. When these trials occur, they must include full informed consent and provide for careful oversight by external review groups.

Ultimately, there will be medical interventions that are scientifically feasible but ethically or socially unacceptable to some members of a society. Stem cell research raises fundamentally difficult questions about the definition of human life, and it has raised deep fears about the ability to balance issues of justice and safety with the needs of critically ill patients. Health care providers and experts with backgrounds in ethics, law, and sociology, must help guard against the premature or inappropriate application of stem cell therapies and the inappropriate use of vulnerable population groups. However, these therapies offer important new strategies for the treatment of otherwise irreversible disorders. An open dialogue among the scientific community, physicians, patients and their advocates, lawmakers, and the lay population is critically important to raise and address important ethical issues and balance the benefits and risks associated with stem cell transfer.

Gene Therapy in Clinical Medicine: Introduction

Gene transfer is a novel area of therapeutics in which the active agent is a nucleic acid rather than a protein or small molecule. Because delivery of naked DNA or RNA to a cell is an inefficient process, most gene transfer is carried out using a vector, or gene delivery vehicle. These vehicles have generally been engineered from viruses by deleting some or all of the viral genome and replacing it with the therapeutic gene of interest under the control of a suitable promoter (Table 68每1). Gene transfer strategies can be described in terms of three essential elements: (1) a vector; (2) a gene to be delivered, sometimes called the transgene; and (3) a relevant target cell to which the DNA or RNA is delivered. The series of steps in which the donated DNA enters the target cell and expresses the transgene is referred to as transduction. Gene delivery can take place in vivo, in which the vector is directly injected into the patient or, in the case of hematopoietic and some other target cells, ex vivo, with removal of the target cells from the patient, followed by return of the modified autologous cells after gene transfer in the laboratory. The latter approach offers opportunities to integrate gene transfer techniques with cellular therapies (Chap. 67).

Gene transfer technology is still under development, although licensing applications for gene therapy products have been filed. Gene therapy is one of the most complex therapeutic modalities yet attempted, and each new disease represents a therapeutic problem for which dosing, safety, and efficacy must be defined. Nonetheless, gene transfer remains one of the most powerful concepts in modern molecular medicine and has the potential to address a host of diseases for which there are currently no cures or, in some cases, no available treatment. More than 5000 subjects have been enrolled in gene transfer studies, and serious adverse events have been rare. Gene therapies are being developed for a wide variety of disease entities (Fig. 68-1).

Gene Transfer for Genetic Disease

Gene transfer strategies for genetic disease generally involve gene addition therapy. This approach most commonly involves transfer of the missing gene to a physiologically relevant target cell. However, other strategies are possible, including supplying a gene that achieves a similar biologic effect through an alternative pathway (e.g., factor VIIa for hemophilia A), supplying an antisense oligonucleotide to splice out a mutant exon if the sequence is not critical to the function of the protein (as has been done with the dystrophin gene in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy), or downregulating a harmful response through an siRNA. Two distinct strategies are used to achieve long-term gene expression: one is to transduce stem cells with an integrating vector, so that all progeny cells will carry the donated gene; the other is to transduce long-lived cells such as skeletal muscle or neural cells. In the case of long-lived cells, integration into the target cell genome is unnecessary. Instead, because the cells are nondividing, the donated DNA can be stabilized in an episomal form, avoiding problems related to integration and insertional mutagenesis.

Immunodeficiency Disorders: Proof of Principle

Early attempts to effect gene replacement into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were stymied by the relatively low transduction efficiency of retroviral vectors, which require dividing target cells for integration. Because HSCs are normally quiescent, they are a formidable transduction target. However, identification of cytokines that induced cell division without promoting differentiation of stem cells, along with technical improvements in the isolation and transduction of HSCs, led to modest but real gains in transduction efficiency.

The first convincing therapeutic effect from gene transfer occurred with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID), which results from mutations in the gene (IL2RG) encoding the c subunit of cytokine receptors required for normal development of T and NK cells (Chap. 316). Affected infants present in the first few months of life with overwhelming infections and/or failure to thrive. In this disorder, it was recognized that the transduced cells, even if few in number, would have a proliferative advantage compared to the nontransduced cells, which lack receptors for the cytokines required for lymphocyte development and maturation. Complete reconstitution of the immune system, including documented responses to standard childhood vaccinations, clearing of infections, and remarkable gains in growth occurred in most of the treated children. However, among 20 children treated in two separate trials, 5 developed a syndrome similar to T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia, with splenomegaly, rising white blood cell counts, and the emergence of a single clone of T cells. In most of these children, the retroviral vector had integrated within a gene, LMO-2 (LIM only-2), which encodes a component of a transcription factor complex involved in hematopoietic development. The retroviral long terminal repeat is thought to increase the expression of LMO-2.

The X-linked SCID studies were a watershed event in the evolution of gene therapy. They demonstrated conclusively that gene therapy could cure disease; of the 20 children eventually treated in these trials, 18 achieved correction of the immunodeficiency disorder. Unfortunately, 5 later developed a leukemia-like disorder, and 1 died of this complication, but the rest are alive and free of complications for up to 10 years after initial treatment. These studies also demonstrated that insertional mutagenesis leading to cancer was more than a hypothetical possibility (Table 68每2). As a result of the experience in these trials, all protocols using integrating vectors in hematopoietic cells must include a plan for monitoring sites of insertion and clonal proliferation. Strategies to overcome this complication have included employing a "suicide" gene cassette in the vector, so that errant clones can be quickly ablated; or using "insulator" elements in the cassette, which can limit the activation of genes surrounding the insertion site. Lentiviral vectors, which can efficiently transduce nondividing target cells, may prove to be safer than retroviral vectors, based on patterns of integration; the field is thus gradually using these as an alternative to retroviral vectors.

Gene silencing: repression of promoter 
Genotoxicity: complications arising from insertional mutagenesis 
Phenotoxicity: complications arising from overexpression or ectopic expression of the transgene 
Immunotoxicity: harmful immune response to either the vector or transgene 
Risks of horizontal transmission: shedding of infectious vector into environment 
Risks of vertical transmission: germline transmission of donated DNA 
 

 

More clear-cut success has been achieved in a gene therapy trial for another form of SCID, adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency (Chap. 316). ADA-SCID is clinically similar to X-linked SCID, although it can be treated by enzyme replacement therapy with a pegylated form of the enzyme (PEG-ADA), which leads to immune reconstitution but not always to normal T cell counts. Enzyme replacement therapy is expensive (annual costs: $200,000每$300,000 in U.S. dollars). The initial trials of gene therapy for ADA-SCID were unsuccessful, but modifications of this protocol to include the use of HSCs rather than T cells as the target for transduction; discontinuation of PEG-ADA at the time of vector infusion, so that the transduced cells have a proliferative advantage over the nontransduced; and the use of a mild conditioning regimen to facilitate engraftment of the transduced cells. There have been no complications in the 10 children treated on the Milan protocol, with a median follow-up of >4 years. ADA-SCID, then, is an example where gene therapy has changed therapeutic options for patients. For those with an HLA-identical sibling, bone marrow transplantation is still the best treatment option, but this applies to only a minority of those affected. For those without an HLA-identical match, gene therapy has comparable efficacy to PEG-ADA and does not run the risk of neutralizing antibodies to the bovine enzyme.

Other Applications of Integrating Vectors

More recently, therapeutic success has also been reported in the setting of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, a fatal demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by mutations in the gene encoding an adenosine triphosphate每binding cassette transporter. Deficiency of this protein leads to adrenal insufficiency and accumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids in oligodendrocytes and microglia, disrupting myelin maintenance by these cells. Affected boys present with clinical and neuroradiographic evidence of disease at age 6每8 years and usually die before adolescence. Aubourg and colleagues have shown dramatic stabilization of disease both clinically and radiographically following lentiviral transduction of hematopoietic stem cells in young boys with disease. Other diseases likely to be amenable to transduction of HSCs include Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, chronic granulomatous disease, thalassemia, and sickle cell disease, with trials under way currently for the first three of these disorders.

Long-Term Expression in Genetic Disease: In Vivo Gene Transfer with Recombinant Adeno-Associated Viral (Aav) Vectors

Recombinant AAV vectors have emerged as attractive gene delivery vehicles for genetic disease. Engineered from a small replication-defective DNA virus, they are devoid of viral coding sequences and trigger very little immune response in experimental animals. They are capable of transducing nondividing target cells, and the donated DNA is stabilized primarily in an episomal form, thus minimizing risks associated with insertional mutagenesis. Because the vector has a tropism for certain long-lived cell types, such as skeletal muscle, the central nervous system, and hepatocytes, long-term expression can be achieved even in the absence of integration.

Clinical trials using recombinant AAV vectors are now ongoing for muscular dystrophies, 1-antitrypsin deficiency, Parkinson's disease, lipoprotein lipase deficiency, hemophilia B, and a form of congenital blindness called Leber's congenital amaurosis. Hemophilia is often considered a promising disease model for gene transfer, as the gene product does not require precise regulation of expression and biologically active clotting factors can be synthesized in a variety of tissue types, permitting latitude in choice of target tissue. Moreover, raising circulating factor levels from <1% (levels seen in those severely affected) into the range of 5% greatly improves the phenotype of the disease. Preclinical studies with recombinant AAV vectors infused into skeletal muscle or liver have resulted in long-term (>5 years) expression of factor VIII or factor IX in the hemophilic dog model. Administration to skeletal muscle of an AAV vector expressing factor IX in patients with hemophilia was safe and resulted in long-term expression as measured by muscle biopsy, but circulating levels never rose >1% for sustained periods, and a large number of IM injections (>80每100) was required to access a large muscle mass. Intravascular vector delivery has been employed to access large areas of skeletal muscle in animal models of hemophilia and will likely be tested in upcoming trials. Administration of an AAV vector expressing factor IX to the liver in humans with hemophilia resulted in therapeutic circulating levels at the highest dose tested, but expression at these levels (>5%) lasted for only 6每10 weeks before declining to baseline (<1%). A memory T cell response to viral capsid, present in humans but not in other animal species (which are not natural hosts for the virus), may be a contributing factor in the loss of expression (Table 68每2). Trials currently under way are testing two potential strategies to overcome this obstacle〞in the first, subjects receive a short course of immunosuppression coadministered with the vector to block the immune response to capsid until the capsid proteins have been degraded and metabolized. In the second, the use of a more efficient expression cassette with a codon-optimized, self-complementary design should allow expression of factor IX at lower doses of vector, which may also elude the immune response.

Early experience with AAV in liver in the hemophilia trial suggested that introduction of small doses of vector into an immunoprivileged site might allow long-term expression, even in humans previously exposed to AAV. This has been most elegantly demonstrated in the setting of the retinal degenerative disease Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA). LCA, characterized by early-onset blindness, is not currently treatable, and is caused by mutations in several different genes; 15% of cases of LCA are due to a mutation in a gene, RPE65, encoding a retinal pigment epithelial-associated 65 kilodalton protein. In dogs with a null mutation in RPE65, sight has been restored after subretinal injection of an AAV vector expressing RPE65. Transgene expression appears to be stable, with the first animals treated >10 years ago continuing to manifest electrophysiologic and behavioral evidence of visual function. As is the case for X-linked SCID, gene transfer must occur relatively early in life to achieve optimal correction of the genetic disease, although the exact limitations imposed by age have not yet been defined. AAV-RPE65 trials carried out in both the United States and the United Kingdom have shown restoration of visual and retinal function in more than 20 subjects, with the most marked improvement occurring in the youngest subjects treated (age 8 years). Other inherited retinal degenerative disorders may also be amenable to correction by gene transfer, as are certain complex acquired disorders such as age-related macular degeneration, which affects several million people worldwide. The neovascularization that occurs in age-related macular degeneration can be inhibited by expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors such as angiostatin, or through the use of RNAi-mediated knockdown of VEGF. Early-phase trials of siRNAs that target VEGF RNA are under way, but these require repeated intravitreal injection of the siRNAs; an AAV vector每mediated approach, which would allow long-term inhibition of the biologic effects of VEGF through a soluble VEGF receptor is now in early-phase clinical testing.

Gene Therapy for Cancer

The majority of clinical gene transfer experience has been in subjects with cancer (Fig. 68-1). As a general rule, a feature that distinguishes gene therapies from conventional cancer therapeutics is that the former are less toxic, in some cases because they are delivered locally (e.g., intratumoral injections), and in other cases because they are targeted specifically to features of the tumor (immunotherapies, antiangiogenic approaches).

Cancer gene therapies can be divided into local and systemic approaches (Table 68每3). Some of the earliest cancer gene therapy trials focused on local delivery of a prodrug or a suicide gene that would increase sensitivity of tumor cells to cytotoxic drugs. A frequently used strategy has been intratumoral injection of an adenoviral vector expressing the thymidine kinase (TK) gene. Cells that take up and express the TK gene can be killed after the administration of gancyclovir, which is phosphorylated to a toxic nucleoside by TK. Because cell division is required for the toxic nucleoside to affect cell viability, this strategy was initially used in aggressive brain tumors (glioblastoma multiforme) where the cycling tumor cells were affected but the nondividing normal neurons were not. More recently, this approach has been explored for locally recurrent prostate, breast, and colon tumors, among others.

Another local approach uses adenoviral-mediated expression of the tumor suppressor p53, which is mutated in a wide variety of cancers. This strategy has shown complete and partial responses in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, esophageal cancer, and non-small-cell lung cancer after direct intratumoral injection of the vector. Response rates (15%) are comparable to those of other single agents. The use of oncolytic viruses that selectively replicate in tumor cells but not in normal cells has also shown promise in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and in other solid tumors. This approach is based on the observation that deletion of certain viral genes abolishes their ability to replicate in normal cells but not in tumor cells. An advantage of this strategy is that the replicating vector can proliferate and spread within the tumor, facilitating eventual tumor clearance. However, physical limitations to viral spread, including fibrosis, intermixed normal cells, basement membranes, and necrotic areas within the tumor, may reduce clinical efficacy. Oncolytic viruses are licensed and available in some countries, but not in the United States.

Because metastatic disease rather than uncontrolled growth of the primary tumor is the source of mortality for most cancers, there has been considerable interest in developing systemic gene therapy approaches. One strategy has been to promote more efficient recognition of tumor cells by the immune system. Approaches have included transduction of tumor cells with immune-enhancing genes encoding cytokines, chemokines, or co-stimulatory molecules. Sustained clinical responses provide evidence that the transduced cells can act as a vaccine. In a related approach, patient lymphocytes have been transduced with genes encoding a T cell receptor每like molecule, with a tumor antigen每binding domain fused to an intracellular signaling domain to allow T cell activation, thereby converting normal lymphocytes into cells capable of recognizing and destroying tumor cells. A third immunotherapy approach relies on ex vivo manipulation of dendritic cells to enhance the presentation of tumor antigens. These immunologic approaches may be of particular value in treating minimal residual disease after other anticancer modalities.

Gene transfer strategies have also been developed for inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. These have included constitutive expression of angiogenesis inhibitors such as angiostatin and endostatin; use of siRNA to reduce levels of VEGF or VEGF receptor; and combined approaches in which autologous T cells are genetically modified to recognize antigens specific to tumor vasculature. These studies are still in early-phase testing.

Another novel systemic approach is the use of gene transfer to protect normal cells from the toxicities of chemotherapy. The most extensively studied of these approaches has been transduction of hematopoietic cells with genes encoding resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, including the multidrug resistance gene MDRI or the gene encoding O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Ex vivo transduction of hematopoietic cells, followed by autologous transplantation, is being investigated as a strategy for allowing administration of higher doses of chemotherapy than would otherwise be tolerated.

Gene Therapy for Vascular Disease

The third major category addressed by gene transfer studies is cardiovascular disease. The most extensive experience has been in trials designed to increase blood flow to either skeletal (critical limb ischemia) or cardiac muscle (angina/myocardial ischemia). Initial treatment options for both of these groups include mechanical revascularization or medical management, but a subset of patients are not candidates for, or fail, these approaches. These patients have formed the first cohorts for evaluation of gene transfer to achieve therapeutic angiogenesis. The major transgene used has been VEGF, attractive because of its specificity for endothelial cells; other transgenes have included fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1,  subunit (HIF-1). The design of most of the trials has included direct IM (or myocardial) injection of either a plasmid or an adenoviral vector expressing the transgene. Both of these vectors are likely to result in only short-term expression of VEGF. This strategy may be adequate, however, as there is no need for continued transgene expression once the new vessels have formed. Direct injection favors local expression, which should help to avoid systemic effects such as retinal neovascularization or new vessel formation in a nascent tumor. Initial trials of adeno-VEGF or plasmid-VEGF injection have resulted in improvement over baseline in terms of frequency of claudication/angina or amounts of nitroglycerin consumption. Study designs including placebo control groups and more objective endpoints (exercise duration at 3 or 6 months, rest and stress cardiac perfusion scans, and regional wall motion assessed by nonfluoroscopic electroanatomic mapping) continue to suggest a beneficial effect of gene transfer, although definitive conclusions will require larger studies. Continuing areas of investigation include choice of the optimal vector (adenoviral vs. plasmid), the optimal transgene (VEGF, HIF-1, FGF, etc.), the optimal method of delivery in cardiac indications (intracoronary vs. direct myocardial), ideal objective endpoints, and whether concurrent administration of cytokines to mobilize endothelial progenitor cells will augment the therapeutic effect.

Other Diseases

The power and versatility of gene transfer approaches are such that there are few serious disease entities for which gene transfer therapies are not under development. Besides those already discussed, other areas of interest include gene therapies for HIV and for neurodegenerative disorders. The latter include studies in patients with Parkinson's disease, where AAV vectors expressing enzymes required for enhanced production of dopamine, or of the inhibitory neurotransmitter -aminobutyric acid, have been introduced into affected areas of the brain (striatum, subthalamic nucleus) by stereotactic neurosurgery. In Alzheimer's disease, an ex vivo approach in which autologous fibroblasts are transduced with a retroviral vector expressing nerve growth factor, then reimplanted into the basal forebrain, has slowed the rate of cognitive decline in a small phase I study.

Summary

The development of new classes of therapeutics typically takes two to three decades; monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins are recent examples. Gene therapeutics, which entered clinical testing in the early 1990s, are well along in the course of development, and are likely to become increasingly important as a therapeutic modality in the twenty-first century. A central question to be addressed is the long-term safety of gene transfer, and regulatory agencies have mandated a 15-year follow-up for subjects enrolled in gene therapy trials (Table 68每4). Realization of the therapeutic benefits of the Human Genome Project, and of new discoveries such as RNAi, will depend on continued progress in gene transfer technology.

Introduction

As medicine therapy advances, we can now realistically set goals for fully functional living replacement of nearly every diseased organ or tissue. In the past several decades, the limitations of nonliving mechanical solutions to organ and tissue dysfunction are now recognized and include dialysis, mechanical heart valves, metallic orthopedic implants, and nonresorbable hernia mesh. Tissue engineering has broad goals including organ development, the elimination of the waiting time for transplants such as the liver and kidney, the creation of living tissue replacements for soft tissue, bone, cartilage, fascia, and virtually every structure in the body.
 
Materials and Scaffolds for Tissue Engineering

The principal mechanical supporting structure of any engineered tissue is the scaffold. These three-dimensional constructs are often composed of several materials and support the living cells required to generate a functional tissue (Fig. 69-1). The mechanical properties of the scaffolds, such as strength and elasticity, must correspond to the mechanical properties of the target tissue. Moreover, cells respond to environmental cues such that the scaffold should mimic the target tissue to achieve the desired cell alignment and the three-dimensional arrangement of the cells.

Figure 69-1

The ideal scaffold materials for engineered tissues are resorbable materials that break down over time. During resorption, the engineered tissue is remodeled by normal healing processes, leaving only living cellular tissue with natural supporting connective tissue. Many implants or organ assist devices are under development utilizing the principles of tissue engineering with nonresorbable materials. These technologies such as lung assist devices, liver assist devices, and even composite implants with resorbable and nonresorbable components for orthopedic and hernia repair represent an important step toward developing fully resorbable scaffolds for all tissues. Current research is focused on resorbable synthetic polymers (e.g., polyglycolic acid, resorbable polyurethanes, polyglycerol sebacic acid); naturally occurring polymers (e.g., collagens, fibrin); and minerals (e.g., calcium triphosphate). Scaffold materials can be supplemented with growth factors or other cytokines to improve cellular incorporation and differentiation. Other surface modifications including surface texturing and protein or antibody coatings may improve cellular adhesion and migration.

Decellularized connective tissue, or organs, represents a rapidly developing area of materials for engineered tissues. Decellularized hearts reseeded with myocardial cells have been demonstrated to function in vitro, and research is focused on expanding this approach to other organs such as the lung and liver as well as soft tissues using material such as decellularized dermis.
 
Cells for Tissue Engineering

The cellular components of engineered tissues must achieve organ functionality (e.g., hepatocytes), maintain organ structure (e.g., fibroblasts and stromal cells), and deliver blood to the tissue (e.g., endothelial cells and pericytes). The three-dimensional arrangement of the cells is critical for proper function; therefore, coordination of scaffold design and cellular components is essential. Maintenance of appropriate cell-to-cell interactions and cell-to-extracellular matrix interactions establishes the microenvironment that drives the differentiation, proliferation potential, and function of many cell types.

Using autologous cells is a principal goal when developing any engineered tissue. This avoids the tremendous burden of immunosuppression. Induced pluripotent stem cells and adult mesenchymal stem cells (e.g., bone marrow or adipose derived) are two promising autologous progenitor cells sources. Differentiation cues including soluble signals and incorporating genes can drive the progenitor cells into cell lineages and end-organ cells (Chaps. 67 and 68). Finally, achieving an adequate number of cells is important. For example, there are approximately 5 x 1010 hepatocytes in a normal adult liver. Therefore, any cellular differentiation strategy must take into account the number of cells needed to seed the scaffold for appropriate tissue function.

Allogenic cells remain an option for many tissues and have been the principal source of clinically successful engineered tissues to date. Embryonic stem cells continue to hold great promise as an allogenic cell option. Xenogenic cells are important to consider as they are available in large numbers, but their use has been mostly limited to organ support devices (i.e., liver devices) and they are not directly implanted into a patient.
 
In Vitro Maturation of Engineered Tissues

Nearly all tissues have baseline mechanical requirements and many tissues such as heart valves, blood vessels, bone, and tendons must have adequate mechanical properties to achieve function. Mechanical forces are important to induce cell alignment and in the production of an extracellular matrix. Bioreactors have been developed to impart the needed mechanical forces to engineered tissues, including shear stress, pusatile flow, and pressure for valves and blood vessels, and axial tension and compression for bone, cartilage, and tendons.
 
Clinical Applications

Engineered skin substitutes were the first true clinical success of the principles of tissue engineering (Table 69每1). These clinically available products use autologous fibroblasts grown on a resorbable polymer scaffold for a single-layer product or fibroblasts covered with keratinocytes for a two-layer product. Recent products for promoting the healing of skin and dermal wounds also incorporate autologous fibroblasts delivered into the wound. Autologous chondrocytes are being used to heal damaged joints, and they have shown excellent results. Acellular collagen-based materials derived from human or animal dermis are being implanted for soft tissue reconstruction or hernia repair and become cellularized in vivo with autologous cells. Many engineered tissues are in clinical trials (Table 69每2) or under development, including those for bone, cartilage, nerve, skeletal muscle, small-diameter blood vessels, heart valves, and vital organs, including heart, liver, lung, and kidney.

Challenges Ahead

Thin tissues such as skin, cartilage, heart valves, and blood vessels are advantageous in that they can survive on diffusion of oxygen and nutrients, while new blood vessels sprout for permanent tissue formation. Thick tissues and solid organs depend on an elaborate network of blood vessels that course within 150每200 m of each cell in that tissue. The heart requires so much oxygen that often there are blood vessels on both sides of an individual cardiomyocyte. Development of blood vessel networks within tissues is the principal challenge for engineered tissues. Angiogenesis can be used to create capillary networks for musculoskeletal and soft tissues while engineered vascular networks utilizing microfluidic principles are being developed for solid organs such as the liver and lung.

In vitro expansion and differentiation of progenitor cells to tissue-specific cells also remains an important milestone. This includes optimization of the different cell types and ratios for each tissue for long-term tissue function. Conditions necessary for in vitro culture and preimplant logistics such as delivery and storage are just beginning to be addressed for complex tissues.
