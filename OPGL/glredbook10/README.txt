This ReadMe belongs to the glredbook10 package of glredbook project.

The Java code example in this directory are ports of C examples that 
accompany the examples printed in the _OpenGL Programming Guide_, 
published by Addison-Wesley; ISBN 0-201-63274-8.  
(Japanese language edition:  ISBN: 4-7952-9645-6)

The source code examples here need to be compiled with jogl.jar 
and the system dependent jogl-natives-*.jar 
(where * is either linux, win32, solsparc, solx86, and/or macosx).

- No ant build file is available yet.
- All programs require Java Runtime 1.4.2.
- All examples that includes jitter.h 
  has an internal copy.
- All examples extends from glskeleton.java

Note: Color Index examples are not support in javax.media.opengl (jogl), 
so they are not ported. NURBS are also not ported for the same reason.
LIST:
- antiindex.c
- antipindex.c
- fogindex.c
- nurbs.c
- surface.c
- trim.c

jfont.java is my replacement for xfont.c. jfont uses Java's GlyphVector
structure a string's geometry while xfont uses X Window specific code
to do the same.
