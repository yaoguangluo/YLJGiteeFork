This README is for the glredbook11 package.

These are port of the examples programs which are featured
in the OpenGL Programming Guide, 2nd Edition corresponding
to OpenGL version 1.1.

- All examples requires JDK 1.4.2 and javax.media.opengl (jogl)
  and a system dependent jogl-natives-*.jar to compile.
- No ant build file is yet available.
    
New in the second edition demostrating new features of OpenGL 1.1:

1. polyoff.c	--> polyoff.java
2. texbind.c	--> texbind.java
3. texprox.c	--> texprox.java
4. texsub.c		--> texsub.java
5. varray.c		--> varray.java

These may not be able to run in OpenGL 1.1, unless modified 
to support extensions.

OpenGL 1.0 to 1.1 compatibility issues:
There are nine programs that are modify for 1.1 features 
but they will also run in 1.0.

Four programs--checker.c, mipmap.c, texgen.c, and wrap.c--using
texture objects have been modified so that they will avoid
the use of texture objects on OpenGL 1.0 machines.
