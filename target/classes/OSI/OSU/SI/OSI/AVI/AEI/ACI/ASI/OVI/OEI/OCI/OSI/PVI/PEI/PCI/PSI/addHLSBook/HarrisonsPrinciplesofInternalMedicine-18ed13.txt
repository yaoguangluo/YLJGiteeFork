
Cellular and Molecular Biology of the Kidney: Introduction

The kidney is one of the most highly differentiated organs in the body. At the conclusion of embryologic development, nearly 30 different cell types form a multitude of filtering capillaries and segmented nephrons enveloped by a dynamic interstitium. This cellular diversity modulates a variety of complex physiologic processes. Endocrine functions, the regulation of blood pressure and intraglomerular hemodynamics, solute and water transport, acid-base balance, and removal of drug metabolites are all accomplished by intricate mechanisms of renal response. This breadth of physiology hinges on the clever ingenuity of nephron architecture that evolved as complex organisms came out of water to live on land.
 
Embryologic Development

Kidneys develop from intermediate mesoderm under the timed or sequential control of a growing number of genes, described in Fig. 277-1. The transcription of these genes is guided by morphogenic cues that invite two ureteric buds to each penetrate bilateral metanephric blastema, where they induce primary mesenchymal cells to form early nephrons. This induction involves a number of complex signaling pathways mediated by Pax2, Six2, WT-1, Wnt9b, c-Met, fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor , glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and epidermal growth factor. The two ureteric buds emerge from posterior nephric ducts and mature into separate collecting systems that eventually form a renal pelvis and ureter. Induced mesenchyme undergoes mesenchymal epithelial transitions to form comma-shaped bodies at the proximal end of each ureteric bud leading to the formation of S-shaped nephrons that cleft and enjoin with penetrating endothelial cells derived from sprouting angioblasts. Under the influence of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), these penetrating cells form capillaries with surrounding mesangial cells that differentiate into a glomerular filter for plasma water and solute. The ureteric buds branch, and each branch produces a new set of nephrons. The number of branching events ultimately determines the total number of nephrons in each kidney. There are approximately 900,000 glomeruli in each kidney in normal birth weight adults and as few as 225,000 in low birth weight adults〞producing the latter in numerous comorbid risks.

Glomeruli evolve as complex capillary filters with fenestrated endothelia under the guiding influence of VEGF-A and angiopoietin-1 secreted by adjacently developing podocytes. Epithelial podocytes facing the urinary space envelop the exterior basement membrane supporting these emerging endothelial capillaries. Podocytes are partially polarized and periodically fall off into the urinary space by epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and to a lesser extent apoptosis, only to be replenished by migrating parietal epithelia from Bowman's capsule. Failing replenishment results in heavy proteinuria. Podocytes attach to the basement membrane by special foot processes and share a slit-pore membrane with their neighbor. The slit-pore membrane forms a filter for plasma water and solute by the synthetic interaction of nephrin, annexin-4, CD2AP, FAT, ZO-1, P-cadherin, podocin, TRPC6, PLCE1, and neph 1每3 proteins. Mutations in many of these proteins also result in heavy proteinuria. The glomerular capillaries are embedded in a mesangial matrix shrouded by parietal and proximal tubular epithelia forming Bowman's capsule. Mesangial cells have an embryonic lineage consistent with arteriolar or juxtaglomerular cells and contain contractile actin-myosin fibers. These mesangial cells make contact with glomerular capillary loops, and their local matrix holds them in condensed arrangement.

Between nephrons lies the renal interstitium. This region forms a functional space surrounding glomeruli and their downstream tubules, which are home to resident and trafficking cells such as fibroblasts, dendritic cells, occasional lymphocytes, and lipid-laden macrophages. The cortical and medullary capillaries, which siphon off solute and water following tubular reclamation of glomerular filtrate, are also part of the interstitial fabric as well as a web of connective tissue that supports the kidney's emblematic architecture of folding tubules. The relational precision of these structures determines the unique physiology of the kidney.

Each nephron is partitioned during embryologic development into a proximal tubule, descending and ascending limbs of the loop of Henle, distal tubule, and the collecting duct. These classic tubular segments build from subsegments lined by highly unique epithelia serving regional physiology. All nephrons have the same structural components, but there are two types whose structure depend on their location within the kidney. The majority of nephrons are cortical, with glomeruli located in the mid-to-outer cortex. Fewer nephrons are juxtamedullary, with glomeruli at the boundary of the cortex and outer medulla. Cortical nephrons have short loops of Henle, whereas juxtamedullary nephrons have long loops of Henle. There are critical differences in blood supply as well. The peritubular capillaries surrounding cortical nephrons are shared among adjacent nephrons. By contrast, juxtamedullary nephrons depend on individual capillaries called vasa recta. Cortical nephrons perform most of the glomerular filtration because there are more of them and because their afferent arterioles are larger than their respective efferent arterioles. The juxtamedullary nephrons, with longer loops of Henle, create a hyperosmolar gradient for concentrating urine. How developmental instructions specify the differentiation of all these unique epithelia among various tubular segments is still unknown.
 
Determinants and Regulation of Glomerular Filtration

Renal blood flow normally drains approximately 20% of the cardiac output, or 1000 mL/min. Blood reaches each nephron through the afferent arteriole leading into a glomerular capillary where large amounts of fluid and solutes are filtered to form the tubular fluid. The distal ends of the glomerular capillaries coalesce to form an efferent arteriole leading to the first segment of a second capillary network (cortical peritubular capillaries or medullary vasa recta) surrounding the tubules (Fig. 277-2A). Thus, nephrons have two capillary beds arranged in a series separated by the efferent arteriole that regulates the hydrostatic pressure in both capillary beds. The distal capillaries empty into small venous branches that coalesce into larger veins to eventually form the renal vein.

The hydrostatic pressure gradient across the glomerular capillary wall is the primary driving force for glomerular filtration. Oncotic pressure within the capillary lumen, determined by the concentration of unfiltered plasma proteins, partially offsets the hydrostatic pressure gradient and opposes filtration. As the oncotic pressure rises along the length of the glomerular capillary, the driving force for filtration falls to zero on reaching the efferent arteriole. Approximately 20% of the renal plasma flow is filtered into Bowman's space, and the ratio of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to renal plasma flow determines the filtration fraction. Several factors, mostly hemodynamic, contribute to the regulation of filtration under physiologic conditions.

Although glomerular filtration is affected by renal artery pressure, this relationship is not linear across the range of physiologic blood pressures due to autoregulation of GFR. Autoregulation of glomerular filtration is the result of three major factors that modulate either afferent or efferent arteriolar tone: these include an autonomous vasoreactive (myogenic) reflex in the afferent arteriole, tubuloglomerular feedback, and angiotensin II每mediated vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole. The myogenic reflex is a first line of defense against fluctuations in renal blood flow. Acute changes in renal perfusion pressure evoke reflex constriction or dilatation of the afferent arteriole in response to increased or decreased pressure, respectively. This phenomenon helps protect the glomerular capillary from sudden changes in systolic pressure.

Tubuloglomerular feedback changes the rate of filtration and tubular flow by reflex vasoconstriction or dilatation of the afferent arteriole. Tubuloglomerular feedback is mediated by specialized cells in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle called the macula densa that act as sensors of solute concentration and tubular flow rate. With high tubular flow rates, a proxy for an inappropriately high filtration rate, there is increased solute delivery to the macula densa (Fig.277-2B) that evokes vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole causing GFR to return toward normal. One component of the soluble signal from the macula densa is adenosine triphosphate (ATP) released by the cells during increased NaCl reabsorption. ATP is metabolized in the extracellular space to generate adenosine, a potent vasoconstrictor of the afferent arteriole. During conditions associated with a fall in filtration rate, reduced solute delivery to the macula densa attenuates the tubuloglomerular response, allowing afferent arteriolar dilatation and restoring glomerular filtration to normal levels. Angiotensin II and reactive oxygen species enhance, while nitric oxide (NO) blunts, tubuloglomerular feedback.

The third component underlying autoregulation of GFR involves angiotensin II. During states of reduced renal blood flow, renin is released from granular cells within the wall of the afferent arteriole near the macula densa in a region called the juxtaglomerular apparatus (Fig.277-2B). Renin, a proteolyticenzyme, catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, that is subsequently converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (Fig.277-2C). Angiotensin II evokes vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole, and the resulting increased glomerular hydrostatic pressure elevates filtration to normal levels.
 
Mechanisms of Renal Tubular Transport

The renal tubules are composed of highly differentiated epithelia that vary dramatically in morphology and function along the nephron (Fig.277-3). The cells lining the various tubular segments form monolayers connected to one another by a specialized region of the adjacent lateral membranes called the tight junction. Tight junctions form an occlusive barrier that separates the lumen of the tubule from the interstitial spaces surrounding the tubule and also apportions the cell membrane into discrete domains: the apical membrane facing the tubular lumen and the basolateral membrane facing the interstitium. This regionalization allows cells to allocate membrane proteins and lipids asymmetrically. Owing to this feature, renal epithelial cells are said to be polarized. The asymmetric assignment of membrane proteins, especially proteins mediating transport processes, provides the machinery for directional movement of fluid and solutes by the nephron.

Epithelial Solute Transport

There are two types of epithelial transport. Movement of fluid and solutes sequentially across the apical and basolateral cell membranes (or vice versa) mediated by transporters, channels, or pumps is called cellular transport. By contrast, movement of fluid and solutes through the narrow passageway between adjacent cells is called paracellular transport. Paracellular transport occurs through tight junctions, indicating that they are not completely "tight." Indeed, some epithelial cell layers allow rather robust paracellular transport to occur (leaky epithelia), whereas other epithelia have more effective tight junctions (tight epithelia). In addition, because the ability of ions to flow through the paracellular pathway determines the electrical resistance across the epithelial monolayer, leaky and tight epithelia are also referred to as low or high-resistance epithelia, respectively. The proximal tubule contains leaky epithelia, whereas distal nephron segments such as the collecting duct, contain tight epithelia. Leaky epithelia are most well suited for bulk fluid reabsorption, whereas tight epithelia allow for more refined control and regulation of transport.

Membrane Transport

Cell membranes are composed of hydrophobic lipids that repel water and aqueous solutes. The movement of solutes and water across cell membranes is made possible by discrete classes of integral membrane proteins, including channels, pumps, and transporters. These different mechanisms mediate specific types of transport activities, including active transport (pumps), passive transport (channels), facilitated diffusion (transporters), and secondary active transport (cotransporters). Active transport requires metabolic energy generated by the hydrolysis of ATP. Active transport pumps are ion-translocating ATPases, including the ubiquitous Na+/K+-ATPase, the H+-ATPases, and Ca2+-ATPases. Active transport creates asymmetric ion concentrations across a cell membrane and can move ions against a chemical gradient. The potential energy stored in a concentration gradient of an ion such as Na+ can be utilized to drive transport through other mechanisms (secondary active transport). Pumps are often electrogenic, meaning they can create an asymmetric distribution of electrostatic charges across the membrane and establish a voltage or membrane potential. The movement of solutes through a membrane protein by simple diffusion is called passive transport. This activity is mediated by channels created by selectively permeable membrane proteins, and it allows solute or water to move across a membrane driven by favorable concentration gradients or electrochemical potential. Examples in the kidney include water channels (aquaporins), K+ channels, epithelial Na+ channels, and Cl每 channels. Facilitated diffusion is a specialized type of passive transport mediated by simple transporters called carriers or uniporters. For example, hexose transporters such as GLUT2 mediate glucose transport by tubular cells. These transporters are driven by the concentration gradient for glucose that is highest in extracellular fluids and lowest in the cytoplasm due to rapid metabolism. Many other transporters operate by translocating two or more ions/solutes in concert either in the same direction (symporters or cotransporters) or in opposite directions (antiporters or exchangers) across the cell membrane. The movement of two or more ions/solutes may produce no net change in the balance of electrostatic charges across the membrane (electroneutral), or a transport event may alter the balance of charges (electrogenic). Several inherited disorders of renal tubular solute and water transport occur as a consequence of mutations in genes encoding a variety of channels, transporter proteins, and their regulators (Table 277-1).

Segmental Nephron Functions

Each anatomic segment of the nephron has unique characteristics and specialized functions enabling selective transport of solutes and water (Fig. 277-3). Through sequential events of reabsorption and secretion along the nephron, tubular fluid is progressively conditioned into urine. Knowledge of the major tubular mechanisms responsible for solute and water transport is critical for understanding hormonal regulation of kidney function and the pharmacologic manipulation of renal excretion.

Proximal Tubule

The proximal tubule is responsible for reabsorbing ~60% of filtered NaCl and water, as well as ~90% of filtered bicarbonate and most critical nutrients such as glucose and amino acids. The proximal tubule utilizes both cellular and paracellular transport mechanisms. The apical membrane of proximal tubular cells has an expanded surface area available for reabsorptive work created by a dense array of microvilli called the brush border, and leaky tight junctions enable high-capacity fluid reabsorption.

Solute and water pass through these tight junctions to enter the lateral intercellular space where absorption by the peritubular capillaries occurs. Bulk fluid reabsorption by the proximal tubule is driven by high oncotic pressure and low hydrostatic pressure within the peritubular capillaries. Physiologic adjustments in GFR made by changing efferent arteriolar tone cause proportional changes in reabsorption, a phenomenon known as glomerulotubular balance. For example, vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole by angiotensin II will increase glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure but lower pressure in the peritubular capillaries. At the same time, increased GFR and filtration fraction raise oncotic pressure near the end of the glomerular capillary. These changes, a lowered hydrostatic and increased oncotic pressure, increase the driving force for fluid absorption by the peritubular capillaries.

Cellular transport of most solutes by the proximal tubule is coupled to the Na+ concentration gradient established by the activity of a basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase (Fig.277-3A). This active transport mechanism maintains a steep Na+ gradient by keeping intracellular Na+ concentrations low. Solute reabsorption is coupled to the Na+ gradient by Na+-dependent transporters such as Na+-glucose and Na+-phosphate cotransporters. In addition to the paracellular route, water reabsorption also occurs through the cellular pathway enabled by constitutively active water channels (aquaporin-1) present on both apical and basolateral membranes. Small, local osmotic gradients close to plasma membranes generated by cellular Na+ reabsorption are likely responsible for driving directional water movement across proximal tubule cells, but reabsorption along the proximal tubule does not produce a net change in tubular fluid osmolality.

Proximal tubular cells reclaim bicarbonate by a mechanism dependent on carbonic anhydrases. Filtered bicarbonate is first titrated by protons delivered to the lumen by Na+/H+ exchange. The resulting carbonic acid (H2CO3) is metabolized by brush border carbonic anhydrase to water and carbon dioxide. Dissolved carbon dioxide then diffuses into the cell, where it is enzymatically hydrated by cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase to re-form carbonic acid. Finally, intracellular carbonic acid dissociates into free protons and bicarbonate anions, and bicarbonate exits the cell through a basolateral Na+/HCO3每 cotransporter. This process is saturable, resulting in urinary bicarbonate excretion when plasma levels exceed the physiologically normal range (24每26 meq/L). Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide, a class of weak diuretic agents, block proximal tubule reabsorption of bicarbonate and are useful for alkalinizing the urine.

Chloride is poorly reabsorbed throughout the first segment of the proximal tubule, and a rise in Cl每 concentration counterbalances the removal of bicarbonate anion from tubular fluid. In later proximal tubular segments, cellular Cl每 reabsorption is initiated by apical exchange of cellular formate for higher luminal concentrations of Cl每. Once in the lumen, formate anions are titrated by H+ (provided by Na+/H+ exchange) to generate neutral formic acid, which can diffuse passively across the apical membrane back into the cell where it dissociates a proton and is recycled. Basolateral Cl每 exit is mediated by a K+/Cl每 cotransporter.

Reabsorption of glucose is nearly complete by the end of the proximal tubule. Cellular transport of glucose is mediated by apical Na+-glucose cotransport coupled with basolateral, facilitated diffusion by a glucose transporter. This process is also saturable, leading to glycosuria when plasma levels exceed 180每200 mg/dL, as seen in untreated diabetes mellitus.

The proximal tubule possesses specific transporters capable of secreting a variety of organic acids (carboxylate anions) and bases (mostly primary amine cations). Organic anions transported by these systems include urate, ketoacid anions, and several protein-bound drugs not filtered at the glomerulus (penicillins, cephalosporins, and salicylates). Probenecid inhibits renal organic anion secretion and can be clinically useful for raising plasma concentrations of certain drugs like penicillin and oseltamivir. Organic cations secreted by the proximal tubule include various biogenic amine neurotransmitters (dopamine, acetylcholine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and histamine) and creatinine. The ATP-dependent transporter P-glycoprotein is highly expressed in brush border membranes and secretes several medically important drugs, including cyclosporine, digoxin, tacrolimus, and various cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Certain drugs like cimetidine and trimethoprim compete with endogenous compounds for transport by the organic cation pathways. While these drugs elevate serum creatinine levels, there is no change in the actual GFR.

The proximal tubule, through distinct classes of Na+-dependent and Na+-independent transport systems, reabsorbs amino acids efficiently. These transporters are specific for different groups of amino acids. For example, cystine, lysine, arginine, and ornithine are transported by a system comprising two proteins encoded by the SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 genes. Mutations in either SLC3A1 or SLC7A9 impair reabsorption of these amino acids and cause the disease cystinuria. Peptide hormones such as insulin and growth hormone, 2-microglobulin, albumin, and other small proteins, are taken up by the proximal tubule through a process of absorptive endocytosis and are degraded in acidified endocytic lysosomes. Acidification of these vesicles depends on a vacuolar H+-ATPase and Cl每 channel. Impaired acidification of endocytic vesicles because of mutations in a Cl每 channel gene (CLCN5) causes low molecular weight proteinuria in Dent's disease. Renal ammoniagenesis from glutamine in the proximal tubule provides a major tubular fluid buffer to ensure excretion of secreted H+ ion as NH4+ by the collecting duct. Cellular K+ levels inversely modulate ammoniagenesis, and in the setting of high serum K+ from hypoaldosteronism, reduced ammoniagenesis facilitates the appearance of Type IV renal tubular acidosis.

Loop of Henle

The loop of Henle consists of three major segments: descending thin limb, ascending thin limb, and ascending thick limb. These divisions are based on cellular morphology and anatomic location, but also correlate with specialization of function. Approximately 15每25% of filtered NaCl is reabsorbed in the loop of Henle, mainly by the thick ascending limb. The loop of Henle has an important role in urinary concentration by contributing to the generation of a hypertonic medullary interstitium in a process called countercurrent multiplication. The loop of Henle is the site of action for the most potent class of diuretic agents (loop diuretics) and also contributes to reabsorption of calcium and magnesium ions.

The descending thin limb is highly water permeable owing to dense expression of constitutively active aquaporin-1 water channels. By contrast, water permeability is negligible in the ascending limb. In the thick ascending limb, there is a high level of secondary active salt transport enabled by the Na+/K+/2Cl每 cotransporter on the apical membrane in series with basolateral Cl每 channels and Na+/K+-ATPase (Fig.277-3B). The Na+/K+/2Cl每 cotransporter is the primary target for loop diuretics. Tubular fluid K+ is the limiting substrate for this cotransporter (tubular concentration of K+ is similar to plasma, about 4 meq/L), but transporter activity is maintained by K+ recycling through an apical potassium channel. An inherited disorder of the thick ascending limb, Bartter's syndrome, also results in a salt-wasting renal disease associated with hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis; loss-of-function mutations in one of five distinct genes encoding components of the Na+/K+/2Cl每 cotransporter (NKCC2), apical K+ channel (KCNJ1), or basolateral Cl每 channel (CLCNKB, BSND), or calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) can cause Bartter's syndrome.

Potassium recycling also contributes to a positive electrostatic charge in the lumen relative to the interstitium that promotes divalent cation (Mg2+ and Ca2+) reabsorption through a paracellular pathway. A Ca2+-sensing, G-protein每coupled receptor (CaSR) on basolateral membranes regulates NaCl reabsorption in the thick ascending limb through dual signaling mechanisms utilizing either cyclic AMP or eicosanoids. This receptor enables a steep relationship between plasma Ca2+ levels and renal Ca2+ excretion. Loss-of-function mutations in CaSR cause familial hypercalcemic hypocalciuria because of a blunted response of the thick ascending limb to extracellular Ca2+. Mutations in CLDN16 encoding paracellin-1, a transmembrane protein located within the tight junction complex, leads to familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalcuria and nephrocalcinosis, suggesting that the ion conductance of the paracellular pathway in the thick limb is regulated.

The loop of Henle contributes to urine-concentrating ability by establishing a hypertonic medullary interstitium that promotes water reabsorption by the downstream inner medullary collecting duct. Countercurrent multiplication produces a hypertonic medullary interstitium using two countercurrent systems: the loop of Henle (opposing descending and ascending limbs) and the vasa recta (medullary peritubular capillaries enveloping the loop). The countercurrent flow in these two systems helps maintain the hypertonic environment of the inner medulla, but NaCl reabsorption by the thick ascending limb is the primary initiating event. Reabsorption of NaCl without water dilutes the tubular fluid and adds new osmoles to medullary interstitial fluid. Because the descending thin limb is highly water permeable, osmotic equilibrium occurs between the descending limb tubular fluid and the interstitial space, leading to progressive solute trapping in the inner medulla. Maximum medullary interstitial osmolality also requires partial recycling of urea from the collecting duct.

Distal Convoluted Tubule

The distal convoluted tubule reabsorbs ~5% of the filtered NaCl. This segment is composed of a tight epithelium with little water permeability. The major NaCl-transporting pathway utilizes an apical membrane, electroneutral thiazide-sensitive Na+/Cl每 cotransporter in tandem with basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase and Cl每 channels (Fig.277-3C). Apical Ca2+-selective channels (TRPV5) and basolateral Na+/Ca2+ exchange mediate calcium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule. Ca2+ reabsorption is inversely related to Na+ reabsorption and is stimulated by parathyroid hormone. Blocking apical Na+/Cl每 cotransport will reduce intracellular Na+, favoring increased basolateral Na+/Ca2+ exchange and passive apical Ca2+ entry. Loss-of-function mutations of SLC12A3 encoding the apical Na+/Cl每 cotransporter cause Gitelman's syndrome, a salt-wasting disorder associated with hypokalemic alkalosis and hypocalciuria. Mutations in genes encoding WNK kinases, WNK-1 and WNK-4, cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type II or Gordon's syndrome characterized by familial hypertension with hyperkalemia. WNK kinases influence the activity of several tubular ion transporters. Mutations in this disorder lead to overactivity of the apical Na+/Cl每 cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule as the primary stimulus for increased salt reabsorption, extracellular volume expansion, and hypertension. Hyperkalemia may be caused by diminished activity of apical K+ channels in the collecting duct, a primary route for K+ secretion. Mutations in TRPM6 encoding Mg2+ permeable ion channels also cause familial hypomagnesemia with hypocalcemia. A molecular complex of TRPM6 and TRPM7 proteins is critical for Mg2+ reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule.

Collecting Duct

The collecting duct modulates the final composition of urine. The two major divisions, the cortical collecting duct and inner medullary collecting duct, contribute to reabsorbing ~4每5% of filtered Na+ and are important for hormonal regulation of salt and water balance. The cortical collecting duct contains high-resistance epithelia with two cell types. Principal cells are the main water, Na+-reabsorbing, and K+-secreting cells, and the site of action of aldosterone, K+-sparing diuretics, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as spironolactone. The other cells are type A and B intercalated cells. Type A intercalated cells mediate acid secretion and bicarbonate reabsorption also under the influence of aldosterone. Type B intercalated cells mediate bicarbonate secretion and acid reabsorption.

Virtually all transport is mediated through the cellular pathway for both principal cells and intercalated cells. In principal cells, passive apical Na+ entry occurs through the amiloride-sensitive, epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) with basolateral exit via the Na+/K+-ATPase (Fig.277-3E). This Na+ reabsorptive process is tightly regulated by aldosterone and is physiologically activated by a variety of proteolytic enzymes that cleave extracellular domains of ENaC; plasmin in the tubular fluid of nephrotic patients, for example, activates ENaC, leading to sodium retention. Aldosterone enters the cell across the basolateral membrane, binds to a cytoplasmic mineralocorticoid receptor, and then translocates into the nucleus, where it modulates gene transcription, resulting in increased Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion. Activating mutations in ENaC increase Na+ reclamation and produce hypokalemia, hypertension, and metabolic alkalosis (Liddle's syndrome). The potassium-sparing diuretics amiloride and triamterene block ENaC, causing reduced Na+ reabsorption.

Principal cells secrete K+ through an apical membrane potassium channel. Several forces govern the secretion of K+. Most importantly, the high intracellular K+ concentration generated by Na+/K+-ATPase creates a favorable concentration gradient for K+ secretion into tubular fluid. With reabsorption of Na+ without an accompanying anion, the tubular lumen becomes negative relative to the cell interior, creating a favorable electrical gradient for secretion of potassium. When Na+ reabsorption is blocked, the electrical component of the driving force for K+ secretion is blunted and this explains lack of excess urinary K+ loss during treatment with potassium-sparing diuretics. K+ secretion is also promoted by aldosterone actions that increase regional Na+ transport favoring more electronegativity and by increasing the number and activity of potassium channels. Fast tubular fluid flow rates that occur during volume expansion or diuretics acting "upstream" of the cortical collecting duct also increase K+ secretion, as does the presence of relatively nonreabsorbable anions (including bicarbonate and semisynthetic penicillins) that contribute to the lumen-negative potential. Off-target effects of certain antibiotics such as trimethoprim and pentamidine, block ENaCs and predispose to hyperkalemia, especially when renal K+ handling is impaired for other reasons. Principal cells, as described below, also participate in water reabsorption by increased water permeability in response to vasopressin.

Intercalated cells do not participate in Na+ reabsorption but instead mediate acid-base secretion. These cells perform two types of transport: active H+ transport mediated by H+-ATPase (proton pump), and Cl每/HCO3每 exchange. Intercalated cells arrange the two transport mechanisms on opposite membranes to enable either acid or base secretion. Type A intercalated cells have an apical proton pump that mediates acid secretion and a basolateral Cl每/HCO3每 anion exchanger for bicarbonate reabsorption (Fig. 277-3E); aldosterone increases the number of H+-ATPase pumps, sometimes contributing to the development of metabolic alkalosis. By contrast, type B intercalated cells have the anion exchanger on the apical membrane to mediate bicarbonate secretion while the proton pump resides on the basolateral membrane to enable acid reabsorption. Under conditions of acidemia, the kidney preferentially uses type A intercalated cells to secrete the excess H+ and generate more HCO3每. The opposite is true in states of bicarbonate excess with alkalemia where the type B intercalated cells predominate. An extracellular protein called hensin mediates this adaptation.

Inner medullary collecting duct cells share many similarities with principal cells of the cortical collecting duct. They have apical Na+ and K+ channels that mediate Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion, respectively (Fig.277-3F). Inner medullary collecting duct cells also have vasopressin-regulated water channels (aquaporin-2 on the apical membrane, aquaporin-3 and -4 on the basolateral membrane). The antidiuretic hormone vasopressin binds to the V2 receptor on the basolateral membrane and triggers an intracellular signaling cascade through G-protein每mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase, resulting in an increase in the cellular levels of cyclic AMP. This signaling cascade stimulates the insertion of water channels into the apical membrane of the inner medullary collecting duct cells to promote increased water permeability. This increase in permeability enables water reabsorption and production of concentrated urine. In the absence of vasopressin, inner medullary collecting duct cells are water impermeable, and urine remains dilute.

Sodium reabsorption by inner medullary collecting duct cells is also inhibited by the natriuretic peptides called atrial natriuretic peptide or renal natriuretic peptide (urodilatin); the same gene encodes both peptides but uses different posttranslational processing of a common preprohormone to generate different proteins. Atrial natriuretic peptides are secreted by atrial myocytes in response to volume expansion, whereas urodilatin is secreted by renal tubular epithelia. Natriuretic peptides interact with either apical (urodilatin) or basolateral (atrial natriuretic peptides) receptors on inner medullary collecting duct cells to stimulate guanylyl cyclase and increase levels of cytoplasmic cGMP. This effect in turn reduces the activity of the apical Na+ channel in these cells and attenuates net Na+ reabsorption, producing natriuresis.

The inner medullary collecting duct transports urea out of the lumen, returning urea to the interstitium, where it contributes to the hypertonicity of the medullary interstitium. Urea is recycled by diffusing from the interstitium into the descending and ascending limbs of the loop of Henle.
 
Hormonal Regulation of Sodium and Water Balance

The balance of solute and water in the body is determined by the amounts ingested, distributed to various fluid compartments, and excreted by skin, bowel, and kidneys. Tonicity, the osmolar state determining the volume behavior of cells in a solution, is regulated by water balance (Fig.277-4A), and extracellular blood volume is regulated by Na+ balance (Fig.277-4B). The kidney is a critical modulator of both physiologic processes.

Figure 277-4

 
 
 
 
Determinants of sodium and water balance.A. Plasma Na+ concentration is a surrogate marker for plasma tonicity, the volume behavior of cells in a solution. Tonicity is determined by the number of effective osmols in the body divided by the total body H2O (TB H2O), which translates simply into the total body Na (TB Na+) and anions outside the cell separated from the total body K (TB K+) inside the cell by the cell membrane. Net water balance is determined by the integrated functions of thirst, osmoreception, Na reabsorption, vasopressin release, and the strength of the medullary gradient in the kidney, keeping tonicity within a narrow range of osmolality around 280 mosmol/L. When water metabolism is disturbed and total body water increases, hyponatremia, hypotonicity, and water intoxication occur; when total body water decreases, hypernatremia, hypertonicity, and dehydration occur. B. Extracellular blood volume and pressure are an integrated function of total body Na+ (TB Na+), total body H2O (TB H2O), vascular tone, heart rate, and stroke volume that modulates volume and pressure in the vascular tree of the body. This extracellular blood volume is determined by net Na balance under the control of taste, baroreception, habit, Na+ reabsorption, macula densa/tubuloglomerular feedback, and natriuretic peptides. When Na+ metabolism is disturbed and total body Na+ increases, edema occurs; when total body Na+ is decreased, volume depletion occurs. ADH, antidiuretic hormone; AQP2, aquaporin-2.
 
 

Water Balance

Tonicity depends on the variable concentration of effective osmoles inside and outside the cell causing water to move in either direction across its membrane. Classic effective osmoles, like Na+, K+, and their anions, are solutes trapped on either side of a cell membrane, where they collectively partition and obligate water to move and find equilibrium in proportion to retained solute; Na+/K+-ATPase keeps most K+ inside cells and most Na+ outside. Normal tonicity (~280 mosmol/L) is rigorously defended by osmoregulatory mechanisms that control water balance to protect tissues from inadvertent dehydration (cell shrinkage) or water intoxication (cell swelling), both of which are deleterious to cell function (Fig. 277-4A).

The mechanisms that control osmoregulation are distinct from those governing extracellular volume, although there is some shared physiology in both processes. While cellular concentrations of K+ have a determinant role in any level of tonicity, the routine surrogate marker for assessing clinical tonicity is the concentration of serum Na+. Any reduction in total body water, which raises the Na+ concentration, triggers a brisk sense of thirst and conservation of water by decreasing renal water excretion mediated by release of vasopressin from the posterior pituitary. Conversely, a decrease in plasma Na+ concentration triggers an increase in renal water excretion by suppressing the secretion of vasopressin. While all cells expressing mechanosensitive TRPV1, 2, or 4 channels, among potentially other sensors, respond to changes in tonicity by altering their volume and Ca2+ concentration, only TRPV+ neuronal cells connected to the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis are osmoreceptive. Only these cells, because of their neural connectivity and adjacency to a minimal blood-brain barrier, modulate the downstream release of vasopressin by the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland. Secretion is stimulated primarily by changing tonicity and secondarily by other nonosmotic signals such as variable blood volume, stress, pain, nausea, and some drugs. The release of vasopressin by the posterior pituitary increases linearly as plasma tonicity rises above normal, although this varies, depending on the perception of extracellular volume (one form of cross-talk between mechanisms that adjudicate blood volume and osmoregulation). Changing the intake or excretion of water provides a means for adjusting plasma tonicity; thus, osmoregulation governs water balance.

The kidneys play a vital role in maintaining water balance through the regulation of renal water excretion. The ability to concentrate urine to an osmolality exceeding that of plasma enables water conservation, while the ability to produce urine more dilute than plasma promotes excretion of excess water. For water to enter or exit a cell, the cell membrane must express aquaporins. In the kidney, aquaporin 1 is constitutively active in all water-permeable segments of the proximal and distal tubules, while vasopressin-regulated aquaporins 2, 3, and 4 in the inner medullary collecting duct promote rapid water permeability. Net water reabsorption is ultimately driven by the osmotic gradient between dilute tubular fluid and a hypertonic medullary interstitium.

Sodium Balance

The perception of extracellular blood volume is determined, in part, by the integration of arterial tone, cardiac stroke volume, heart rate, and the water and solute content of extracellular fluid. Na+ and accompanying anions are the most abundant extracellular effective osmols and together support a blood volume around which pressure is generated. Under normal conditions, this volume is regulated by sodium balance (Fig.277-4B), and the balance between daily Na+ intake and excretion is under the influence of baroreceptors in regional blood vessels and vascular hormone sensors modulated by atrial natriuretic peptides, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, Ca2+ signaling, adenosine, vasopressin, and the neural adrenergic axis. If Na+ intake exceeds Na+ excretion (positive Na+ balance), then an increase in blood volume will trigger a proportional increase in urinary Na+ excretion. Conversely, when Na+ intake is less than urinary excretion (negative Na+ balance), blood volume will decrease and trigger enhanced renal Na+ reabsorption, leading to decreased urinary Na+ excretion.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is the best-understood hormonal system modulating renal Na+ excretion. Renin is synthesized and secreted by granular cells in the wall of the afferent arteriole. Its secretion is controlled by several factors, including 1-adrenergic stimulation to the afferent arteriole, input from the macula densa, and prostaglandins. Renin and ACE activity eventually produce angiotensin II that directly or indirectly promotes renal Na+ and water reabsorption. Stimulation of proximal tubular Na+/H+ exchange by angiotensin II directly increases Na+ reabsorption. Angiotensin II also promotes Na+ reabsorption along the collecting duct by stimulating aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Constriction of the efferent glomerular arteriole by angiotensin II indirectly increases the filtration fraction and raises peritubular capillary oncotic pressure to promote tubular Na+ reabsorption. Finally, angiotensin II inhibits renin secretion through a negative feedback loop. Alternative metabolism of angiotensin by ACE2 generates the vasodilatory peptide angiotensin 1-7 that acts through Mas receptors to counterbalance several actions of angiotensin II on blood pressure and renal function (Fig. 277-2C).

Aldosterone is synthesized and secreted by granulosa cells in the adrenal cortex. It binds to cytoplasmic mineralocorticoid receptors in the collecting duct principal cells that increase activity of ENaC, apical membrane K+ channel, and basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase. These effects are mediated in part by aldosterone-stimulated transcription of the gene encoding serum/glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1 (SGK1). The activity of ENaC is increased by SGK1-mediated phosphorylation of Nedd4-2, a protein that promotes recycling of the Na+ channel from the plasma membrane. Phosphorylated Nedd4-2 has impaired interactions with ENaC, leading to increased channel density at the plasma membrane and increased capacity for Na+ reabsorption by the collecting duct.

Chronic exposure to aldosterone causes a decrease in urinary Na+ excretion lasting only a few days, after which Na+ excretion returns to previous levels. This phenomenon, called aldosterone escape, is explained by decreased proximal tubular Na+ reabsorption following blood volume expansion. Excess Na+ that is not reabsorbed by the proximal tubule overwhelms the reabsorptive capacity of more distal nephron segments. This escape may be facilitated by atrial natriuretic peptides that lose their effectiveness in the clinical settings of heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, and cirrhosis, leading to severe Na+ retention and volume overload.

Adaption of the Kidney to Renal Injury: Introduction

The size of a kidney and the total number of nephrons formed late in embryologic development depend on the degree to which the ureteric bud undergoes branching morphogenesis. Humans have between 225,000 and 900,000 nephrons in each kidney, a number that mathematically hinges on whether ureteric branching goes to completion or is terminated prematurely by one or two cycles. Although the signaling mechanisms regulating cycle number are incompletely understood, these final rounds of branching likely determine how well the kidney will adapt to the physiologic demands of blood pressure and body size, various environmental stresses, or unwanted inflammation leading to chronic renal failure.

One of the intriguing generalities regarding chronic renal failure is that residual nephrons hyperfunction to compensate for the loss of those nephrons succumbing to primary disease. This compensation depends on adaptive changes produced by renal hypertrophy and adjustments in tubuloglomerular feedback and glomerulotubular balance, as advanced in the intact nephron hypothesis by Neal Bricker in 1969. Some physiologic adaptations to nephron loss also produce unintended clinical consequences explained by Bricker's trade-off hypothesis in 1972, and eventually some adaptations accelerate the deterioration of residual nephrons, as described by Barry Brenner in his hyperfiltration hypothesis in 1982. These three important notions regarding chronic renal failure form a conceptual basis for understanding common pathophysiology leading to uremia.
 
Common Mechanisms of Progressive Renal Disease

When the initial complement of nephrons is reduced by a sentinel event, such as unilateral nephrectomy, the remaining kidney adapts by enlarging and increasing its glomerular filtration rate. If the kidneys were initially normal, the filtration rate usually returns to 80% of normal for two kidneys. The remaining kidney grows by compensatory renal hypertrophy with very little cellular proliferation. This unique event is accomplished by increasing the size of each cell along the nephron, which is accommodated by the elasticity or growth of interstitial spaces under the renal capsule. The mechanism of this compensatory renal hypertrophy is only partially understood; studies suggest roles for angiotensin II transactivation of heparin-binding epithelial growth factor, PI3K, and p27kip1, a cell cycle protein that prevents tubular cells exposed to angiotensin II from proliferating, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which mediates new protein synthesis.

Hyperfiltration during pregnancy or in humans born with one kidney or who lose one to trauma or transplantation generally produces no ill consequences. By contrast, experimental animals that undergo resection of 80% of their renal mass, or humans who have persistent injury that destroys a comparable amount of renal tissue, progress to end-stage disease (Fig. 278-1). Clearly, there is a critical amount of primary nephron loss that produces maladaptive deterioration in remaining nephrons. This maladaptive response is referred to clinically as renal progression, and the pathologic correlate of renal progression is the relentless advance of tubular atrophy and tissue fibrosis. The mechanism for this maladaptive response is the focus of intense investigation. A unified theory of renal progression is just starting to emerge, and most importantly, this progression follows a final common pathway regardless of whether renal injury begins in glomeruli or within the tubulointerstitium.

Figure 278-1

 
 
 
Progression of chronic renal injury. Although various types of renal injury have their own unique rates of progression, one of the best understood is that associated with type I diabetic nephropathy. Notice the early increase in glomerular filtration rate, followed by inexorable decline associated with increasing proteinuria. Also indicated is the National Kidney Foundation K/DOQI classification of the stages of chronic kidney disease.
 
 


There are six mechanisms that hypothetically unify this final common pathway. If injury begins in glomeruli, these sequential steps build on each other: (1) persistent glomerular injury produces local hypertension in capillary tufts, increases their single-nephron glomerular filtration rate and engenders protein leak into the tubular fluid; (2) significant glomerular proteinuria, accompanied by increases in the local production of angiotensin II, facilitates a downstream cytokine bath that induces the accumulation of interstitial mononuclear cells; (3) the initial appearance of interstitial neutrophils is quickly replaced by a gathering of macrophages and T lymphocytes, which form a nephritogenic immune response producing interstitial nephritis; (4) some tubular epithelia respond to this inflammation by disaggregating from their basement membrane and adjacent sister cells to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transitions forming new interstitial fibroblasts; and finally (5) surviving fibroblasts lay down a collagenous matrix that disrupts adjacent capillaries and tubular nephrons, eventually leaving an acellular scar. The details of these complex events are outlined below (Fig. 278-2).

Figure 278-2

 
 
 
Mechanisms of renal progression. The general mechanisms of renal progression advance sequentially through six stages that include hyperfiltration, proteinuria, cytokine bath, mononuclear cell infiltration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and fibrosis. (Modified from Harris and Neilson.)
 
 

Significant ablation of renal mass results in hyperfiltration characterized by an increase in the rate of single-nephron glomerular filtration. The remaining nephrons lose their ability to autoregulate, and systemic hypertension is transmitted to the glomerulus. Both the hyperfiltration and intraglomerular hypertension stimulate the eventual appearance of glomerulosclerosis. Angiotensin II acts as an essential mediator of increased intraglomerular capillary pressure by selectively increasing efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction relative to afferent arteriolar tone. Angiotensin II impairs glomerular size selectivity, induces protein ultrafiltration, and increases intracellular Ca2+ in podocytes, which alters podocyte function. Diverse vasoconstrictor mechanisms, including blockade of nitric oxide synthase and activation of angiotensin II and thromboxane receptors, can also induce oxidative stress in surrounding renal tissue. Finally, the effects of aldosterone on increasing renal vascular resistance and glomerular capillary pressure, or stimulating plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, facilitate fibrogenesis and may complement the detrimental activity of angiotensin II.

On occasion, inflammation that begins in the renal interstitium disables tubular reclamation of filtered protein, producing mild nonselective proteinuria. Renal inflammation that initially damages glomerular capillaries often spreads to the tubulointerstitium in association with heavier proteinuria. Many clinical observations support the association of worsening glomerular proteinuria with renal progression. The simplest explanation for this expansion of mononuclear cells is that increasingly severe proteinuria triggers a downstream inflammatory cascade in tubular epithelial cells, producing interstitial nephritis, fibrosis, and tubular atrophy. As albumin is an abundant polyanion in plasma and can bind a variety of cytokines, chemokines, and lipid mediators, it is likely these small albumin-carried molecules initiate the tubular inflammation brought on by proteinuria. Furthermore, glomerular injury either adds activated mediators to the proteinuric filtrate or alters the balance of cytokine inhibitors and activators such that attainment of a critical level of activated cytokines eventually damages downstream tubular nephron.

Tubular epithelia bathed in these complex mixtures of proteinuric cytokines respond by increasing their secretion of chemokines and relocating NF-kappa;B to the nucleus to induce the proinflammatory release of transforming growth factor  (TGF-), platelet-derived growth factor每BB (PDGF-BB), and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2). Inflammatory cells are drawn into the renal interstitium by this cytokine milieu. This interstitial spreading reduces the likelihood that the kidney will survive. The immunologic mechanisms for spreading include loss of tolerance to parenchymal self, immune deposits that share cross-reactive epitopes in either compartment or glomerular injury that reveals a new interstitial epitope. Drugs, infection, and metabolic defects also induce autoimmunity through toll-like receptors (TLRs) that bind to ligands with an immunologically distinct molecular pattern. Bacterial and viral ligands activate TLRs but interestingly so do Tamm-Horsfall protein, bacterial CpG repeats, and RNA that is released nonspecifically from injured tubular cells. Dendritic cells and macrophages are subsequently activated, and circulating T cells engage in the formal cellular immunologic response.

Nephritogenic interstitial T cells are a mix of CD4+ helper, CD17+ effector, and CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes. Presumptive evidence of antigen-driven T cells found by examining the DNA sequence of T cell receptors suggests a polyclonal expansion responding to multiple epitopes. Some experimental interstitial lesions are histologically analogous to a cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, and more intense reactions sometimes induce granuloma formation. The cytotoxic activity of antigen-reactive T cells probably accounts for tubular cell destruction and atrophy. Cytotoxic T cells synthesize proteins with serine esterase activity as well as pore-forming proteins, which can effect membrane damage much like the activated membrane attack complex of the complement cascade. Such enzymatic activity provides a structural explanation for target cell lysis.

One long-term consequence of tubular epithelia and adjacent endothelia exposed to cytokines is the profibrotic activation of epithelial/endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Persistent cytokine activity during renal inflammation and disruption of underlying basement membranes by local proteases initiates the process of transition. Rather than collapsing into the tubular lumens and dying, some epithelia become fibroblasts while translocating back into the interstitial space behind deteriorating tubules through holes in the ruptured basement membrane; the contribution of endothelial cells from interstitial vessels may be equally important. Wnt proteins, integrin-linked kinases, insulin-like growth factors, EGF, FGF-2, and TGF- are among the classic modulators of EMT. Fibroblasts that deposit collagen during fibrogenesis also replicate locally at sites of persistent inflammation. Estimates indicate that more than half of the total fibroblasts found in fibrotic renal tissues are products of the proliferation of newly transitioned or preexisting fibroblasts. Fibroblasts are stimulated to multiply by activation of cognate cell-surface receptors for PDGF and TGF-.

Tubulointerstitial scars are composed principally of fibronectin, collagen types I and III, and tenascin, but other glycoproteins such as thrombospondin, SPARC, osteopontin, and proteoglycan may be also important. Although tubular epithelia can synthesize collagens I and III and are modulated by a variety of growth factors, these epithelia disappear through transition and tubular atrophy, leaving fibroblasts as the major contributor to matrix production. After fibroblasts acquire a synthetic phenotype, expand their population, and locally migrate around areas of inflammation, they begin to deposit fibronectin, which provides a scaffold for interstitial collagens. When fibroblasts outdistance their survival factors, they die from apoptosis, leaving an acellular scar.
 
Response to Reduction in Numbers of Functioning Nephrons

As mentioned above, the response to the loss of many functioning nephrons produces an increase in renal blood flow with glomerular hyperfiltration, which is the result of increased vasoconstriction in postglomerular efferent arterioles relative to preglomerular afferent arterioles, increasing the intraglomerular capillary pressure and filtration fraction. Persistent intraglomerular hypertension is associated with progressive nephron destruction. Although the hormonal and metabolic factors mediating hyperfiltration are not fully understood, a number of vasoconstrictive and vasodilatory substances have been implicated, chief among them being angiotensin II. Angiotensin II incrementally vasoconstricts the efferent arteriole, and studies in animals and humans demonstrate that interruption of the renin-angiotensin system with either angiotensin-converting inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers will decrease intraglomerular capillary pressure, decrease proteinuria, and slow the rate of nephron destruction. The vasoconstrictive agent endothelin has also been implicated in hyperfiltration, and increases in afferent vasodilatation have been attributed, at least in part, to local prostaglandins and release of endothelium-derived nitric oxide. Finally, hyperfiltration may be mediated in part by a resetting of the kidney's intrinsic autoregulatory mechanism of glomerular filtration by a tubuloglomerular feedback system. This feedback originates from the macula densa and modulates renal blood flow and glomerular filtration (see Chap. 277).

Even with the loss of functioning nephrons, there is some continued maintenance of glomerulotubular balance, by which the residual tubules adapt to increases in single nephron glomerular filtration with appropriate alterations in reabsorption or excretion of filtered water and solutes in order to maintain homeostasis. Glomerulotubular balance results both from tubular hypertrophy and from regulatory adjustments in tubular oncotic pressure or solute transport along the proximal tubule. Some studies indicate these alterations in tubule size and function may themselves be maladaptive, and as a trade-off, predispose to further tubule injury.
 
Tubular Function in Chronic Renal Failure

Sodium

Na+ ions are reclaimed along many parts of the nephron by various transport mechanisms (see Chapter 278). This transport function and its contribution to maintaining extracellular blood volume usually remains near normal until limitations from advanced renal disease inadequately excrete dietary Na+ intake. Prior to this point and throughout renal progression, increasing the fractional excretion of Na+ in final urine at progressively reduced rates of glomerular filtration provides a mechanism of early adaptation. Na+ excretion increases predominantly by decreasing Na+ reabsorption in the loop of Henle and distal nephron. An increase in the osmotic obligation of residual nephrons increases tubular water and lowers the concentration of Na+ in tubular fluid, reducing efficient Na+ reclamation; increased excretion of inorganic and organic anions also obligates more Na+ excretion. In addition, hormonal influences, notably increased expression of atrial natriuretic peptides that increase distal Na+ excretion, play an important role in maintaining net Na+ excretion. Although many details of these adjustments are only understood conceptually, it is an example of a trade-off by which initial adjustments following the loss of functioning nephrons leads to compensatory responses that maintain homeostasis. Eventually, with advancing nephron loss, the atrial natriuretic peptides lose their effectiveness and Na+ retention results in intravascular volume expansion, edema, and worsening hypertension.

Urinary Dilution and Concentration

Patients with progressive renal injury gradually lose the capacity either to dilute or concentrate their urine, and urine osmolality becomes relatively fixed about 350 mOsm/L (specific gravity ~1.010). Although the absolute ability of a single nephron to excrete water free of solute may not be impaired, the reduced number of functioning nephrons obligates increased fractional solute excretion by residual nephrons, and this greater obligation impairs the ability to dilute tubular fluid maximally. Similarly, urinary concentrating ability falls as more water is needed to hydrate an increasing solute load. Tubulointerstitial damage also creates insensitivity to the antidiuretic effects of vasopressin along the collecting duct or loss of the medullary gradient that eventually disturbs control of variation in urine osmolality. Patients with moderate degrees of chronic renal failure often complain of nocturia as a manifestation of this fixed urine osmolality, and they are prone to extracellular volume depletion if they do not keep up with the persistent loss of Na+ or to hypotonicity if they drink too much water.

Potassium

Renal excretion is the major pathway for reducing excess total body K+. Normally, the kidney excretes 90% of dietary K+, while 10% is excreted in the stool with a trivial amount lost to sweat. Although the colon possesses some capacity to increase K+ excretion〞up to 30% of ingested K+ may be excreted in the stool of patients with worsening renal failure, the majority of the K+ load continues to be excreted by the kidneys due to elevation in levels of serum K+ that increase filtered load. Aldosterone also regulates collecting duct Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion. Aldosterone is released from the adrenal cortex not only in response to the renin-angiotensin system but also in direct response to elevated levels of serum K+ and, for a while, a compensatory increase in the capacity of the collecting duct to secrete K+ keeps up with renal progression. As serum K+ levels rise with renal failure, circulating levels of aldosterone also increase over what is required to maintain normal levels of blood volume.

Acid-Base Regulation

The kidneys excrete 1 meq/kg/day of noncarbonic H+ ion on a normal diet. To do this, all of the filtered HCO32每 needs to be reabsorbed proximally so that H+ pumps in the intercalated cells of the collecting duct can secrete H+ ions that are subsequently trapped by urinary buffers, particularly phosphates and ammonia (see Chap. 277). While remaining nephrons increase their solute load with loss of renal mass, the ability to maintain total body H+ excretion is often impaired by the gradual loss of H+ pumps or with reductions in ammoniagenesis leading to development of a non-delta acidosis. Although hypertrophy of the proximal tubules initially increases their ability to reabsorb filtered HCO32每 and increases ammoniagenesis, with progressive loss of nephrons this compensation is eventually overwhelmed. In addition, with advancing renal failure, ammoniagenesis is further inhibited by elevation in levels of serum K+, producing type IV renal tubular acidosis. Once the glomerular filtration rate falls below 25 mL/min, noncarbonic organic acids accumulate, producing a delta metabolic acidosis. Hyperkalemia can also inhibit tubular HCO32每 reabsorption, as can extracellular volume expansion and elevated levels of parathyroid hormone. Eventually, as the kidneys fail, the level of serum HCO32每 falls severely, reflecting the exhaustion of all body buffer systems, including bone.

Calcium and Phosphate

The kidney and gut play an important role in the regulation of serum levels of Ca2+ and PO42每. With decreasing renal function and the appearance of tubulointerstitial nephritis, the expression of 1-hydroxylase by the proximal tubule is reduced, lowering levels of calcitriol and Ca2+ absorption by the gut. Loss of nephron mass with progressive renal failure also gradually reduces the excretion of PO42每 and Ca2+, and elevations in serum PO42每 further lower serum levels of Ca2+, causing sustained secretion of parathyroid hormone. Unregulated increases in levels of parathyroid hormone cause Ca2+ mobilization from bone, Ca2+/PO42每 precipitation in vascular tissues, abnormal bone remodeling, decreases in tubular bicarbonate reabsorption, and increases in renal PO42每 excretion. While elevated serum levels of parathyroid hormone initially maintain serum PO42每 near normal, with progressive nephron destruction, the capacity for renal PO42每 excretion is overwhelmed, the serum PO42每 elevates, and bone is progressively demineralized from secondary hyperparathyroidism. These adaptations evoke another classic functional trade-off (Fig. 278-3).

Modifiers Influencing the Progression of Renal Disease

Well-described risk factors for the progressive loss of renal function include systemic hypertension, diabetes, and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (Table 278-1). Poor glucose control will aggravate renal progression in both diabetic and nondiabetic renal disease. Angiotensin II produces intraglomerular hypertension and stimulates fibrogenesis. Aldosterone also serves as an independent fibrogenic mediator of progressive nephron loss apart from its role in modulating Na+ and K+ homeostasis. Genetic factors also play a role. There is recent, exciting evidence that risk alleles for APOL1 underlies the increased susceptibility of African Americans to development of progressive kidney injury.

Lifestyle choices also affect the progression of renal disease. Cigarette smoking either predisposes or accelerates the progression of nephron loss. Whether the effect of cigarettes is related to systemic hemodynamic alterations or specific damage to the renal microvasculature and/or tubules is unclear. Increases in fetuin-A, decreases in adiponectin, and increases in lipid oxidation associated with obesity also accelerate cardiovascular disease and progressive renal damage. Recent epidemiologic studies also confirm an association between high protein diets and progression of renal disease. Progressive nephron loss in experimental animals, and possibly in humans, is slowed by adherence to a low protein diet. Although a large multicenter trial, the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease, did not provide conclusive evidence that dietary protein restriction could retard progression to renal failure in humans, secondary analyses and a number of meta-analyses suggest a renoprotective effect from supervised low-protein diets in the range of 0.6每0.75 g/kg/day. Repair of chronic low serum bicarbonate levels during renal progression increases kidney survival. Abnormal Ca2+ and PO42每 metabolism in chronic kidney disease also plays a role in renal progression, and administration of calcitriol or its analogues can attenuate progression in a variety of models of chronic kidney disease.

An intrinsic paucity in the number of functioning nephrons predisposes to the development of renal disease. A reduced number of nephrons leads to permanent hypertension, either through direct renal damage or hyperfiltration producing glomerulosclerosis, or by primary induction of systemic hypertension that further exacerbates glomerular barotrauma. Younger individuals with hypertension who die suddenly as a result of trauma have 47% fewer glomeruli per kidney than age-matched controls.

A consequence of low birth weight is a relative deficit in the number of total nephrons, and low birth weight associates in adulthood with more hypertension and renal failure, among other abnormalities. In this regard, in addition or instead of a genetic predisposition to development of a specific disease or condition such as low birth weight, different epigenetic phenomena may produce varying clinical phenotypes from a single genotype depending upon maternal exposure to different environmental stimuli during gestation, a phenomena known as developmental plasticity. A specific clinical phenotype can also be selected in response to an adverse environmental exposure during critical periods of intrauterine development, also known as fetal programming. In the United States, there is at least a twofold increased incidence of low birth weight among blacks compared with whites, much but not all of which can be attributed to maternal age, health, or socioeconomic status.

As in other conditions producing nephron loss, the glomeruli of low-birth-weight individuals enlarge and associate with early hyperfiltration to maintain normal levels of renal function. With time, the resulting intraglomerular hypertension initiates a progressive decline in residual hyperfunctioning nephrons, ultimately accelerating renal failure. In African Americans, as well as other populations at increased risk for kidney failure, such as Pima Indians and Australian aborigines, large glomeruli are seen at early stages of kidney disease. An association between low birth weight and the development of albuminuria and nephropathy is reported for both diabetic and nondiabetic renal disease.

Acute Kidney Injury: Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI), previously known as acute renal failure, is characterized by the sudden impairment of kidney function resulting in the retention of nitrogenous and other waste products normally cleared by the kidneys. AKI is not a single disease but, rather, a designation for a heterogeneous group of conditions that share common diagnostic features: specifically, an increase in the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration and/or an increase in the plasma or serum creatinine (SCr) concentration, often associated with a reduction in urine volume. AKI can range in severity from asymptomatic and transient changes in laboratory parameters of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), to overwhelming and rapidly fatal derangements in effective circulating volume regulation and electrolyte and acid-base composition of the plasma.

Changing the name of a syndrome as well known as "acute renal failure" does not occur frequently. We will summarize some of the reasons why the name was changed to "acute kidney injury." The term failure reflects only part of the spectrum of damage to the kidney that occurs clinically. In most cases of damage, the reduction in kidney function is modest. Nevertheless, this modest change has been documented to be associated with negative effects on outcome, albeit not nearly as ominous as seen with large decreases in kidney function associated with frank kidney failure that often requires acute dialysis therapies. Furthermore, the term renal is not well understood in the general population and this makes communication with patients and family more challenging; hence "kidney" has replaced "renal."
 
Epidemiology

AKI complicates 5每7% of acute care hospital admissions and up to 30% of admissions to the intensive care unit. AKI is also a major medical complication in the developing world, particularly in the setting of diarrheal illnesses, infectious diseases like malaria and leptospirosis, and natural disasters such as earthquakes. The incidence of AKI has grown by more than fourfold in the United States since 1988 and is estimated to have a yearly incidence of 500 per 100,000 population, higher than the yearly incidence of stroke. AKI is associated with a markedly increased risk of death in hospitalized individuals, particularly in those admitted to the ICU where in-hospital mortality rates may exceed 50%.

Aki in the Developing World

The epidemiology of AKI differs tremendously between developed and developing countries, owing to differences in demographics, economics, geography, and comorbid disease burden. While certain features of AKI are common to both〞particularly since urban centers of some developing countries increasingly resemble those in the developed world〞many etiologies for AKI are region-specific such as envenomations from snakes, spiders, caterpillars, and bees; infectious causes such as malaria and leptospirosis; and crush injuries and resultant rhabdomyolysis from earthquakes.
 
Etiology and Pathophysiology

The causes of AKI have traditionally been divided into three broad categories: prerenal azotemia, intrinsic renal parenchymal disease, and postrenal obstruction (Fig. 279-1).

Figure 279-1

 
 
 
Classification of the major causes of acute kidney injury. ACE-1, angiotensin-converting enzyme 1; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; NSAIDs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; TTP-HUS, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome.
 
 

Prerenal Azotemia

Prerenal azotemia (from "azo," meaning nitrogen, and "-emia") is the most common form of AKI. It is the designation for a rise in SCr or BUN concentration due to inadequate renal plasma flow and intraglomerular hydrostatic pressure to support normal glomerular filtration. The most common clinical conditions associated with prerenal azotemia are hypovolemia, decreased cardiac output, and medications that interfere with renal autoregulatory responses such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and inhibitors of angiotensin II (Fig. 279-2). Prerenal azotemia may coexist with other forms of intrinsic AKI. Prolonged periods of prerenal azotemia may lead to ischemic injury, often termed acute tubular necrosis, or ATN. By definition, prerenal azotemia involves no parenchymal damage to the kidney and is rapidly reversible once intraglomerular hemodynamics are restored.

Figure 279-2

 
 
 
 
 
 
Intrarenal Mechanisms for Autoregulation of the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) under Decreased Perfusion Pressure and Reduction of the GFR by Drugs. Panel A shows normal conditions and a normal GFR. Panel B shows reduced perfusion pressure within the autoregulatory range. Normal glomerular capillary pressure is maintained by afferent vasodilatation and efferent vasoconstriction. Panel C shows reduced perfusion pressure with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Loss of vasodilatory prostaglandins increases afferent resistance; this causes the glomerular capillary pressure to drop below normal values and the GFR to decrease. Panel D shows reduced perfusion pressure with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-I) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Loss of angiotensin II action reduces efferent resistance; this causes the glomerular capillary pressure to drop below normal values and the GFR to decrease. (From N Engl J Med 2007;357:797-805; with permission.)
 
 

Normal GFR is maintained in part by the relative resistances of the afferent and efferent renal arterioles, which determine the glomerular plasma flow and the transcapillary hydraulic pressure gradient that drive glomerular ultrafiltration. Mild degrees of hypovolemia and reductions in cardiac output elicit compensatory renal physiologic changes. Because renal blood flow accounts for 20% of the cardiac output, renal vasoconstriction and salt and water reabsorption occur as a homeostatic response to decreased effective circulating volume or cardiac output in order to maintain blood pressure and increase intravascular volume to sustain perfusion to the cerebral and coronary vessels. Mediators of this response include angiotensin II, norepinephrine, and vasopressin (also termed antidiuretic hormone). Glomerular filtration can be maintained despite reduced renal blood flow by angiotensin II每mediated renal efferent vasoconstriction, which maintains glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure closer to normal and thereby prevents marked reductions in GFR if renal blood flow reduction is not excessive.

In addition, a myogenic reflex within the afferent arteriole leads to dilation in the setting of low perfusion pressure, thereby maintaining glomerular perfusion. Intrarenal biosynthesis of vasodilator prostaglandins (prostacyclin, prostaglandin E2), kallikrein and kinins, and possibly nitric oxide (NO) also increase in response to low renal perfusion pressure. Autoregulation is also accomplished by tubuloglomerular feedback, in which decreases in solute delivery to the macula densa (specialized cells within the proximal tubule) elicit dilation of the juxtaposed afferent arteriole in order to maintain glomerular perfusion, a mechanism mediated, in part, by NO. There is a limit, however, to the ability of these counterregulatory mechanisms to maintain GFR in the face of systemic hypotension. Even in healthy adults, renal autoregulation usually fails once the systolic blood pressure falls below 80 mmHg.

A number of factors determine the robustness of the autoregulatory response and, thereby, the risk of prerenal azotemia. Atherosclerosis, long-standing hypertension, and older age can lead to hyalinosis and myointimal hyperplasia, causing structural narrowing of the intrarenal arterioles and impaired capacity for renal afferent vasodilation. In chronic kidney disease, renal afferent vasodilation may be operating at maximal capacity in order to maximize GFR in response to reduced functional renal mass. Drugs can affect the compensatory changes evoked to maintain GFR. NSAIDs inhibit renal prostaglandin production, limiting renal afferent vasodilation. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) limit renal efferent vasoconstriction; this effect is particularly pronounced in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or unilateral renal artery stenosis (in the case of a solitary functioning kidney) because renal efferent vasoconstriction is needed to maintain GFR due to low renal perfusion. The combined use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents with ACE inhibitors or ARBs poses a particularly high risk for developing prerenal azotemia.

Many individuals with advanced cirrhosis exhibit a unique hemodynamic profile that resembles prerenal azotemia despite total body volume overload. Systemic vascular resistance is markedly reduced due to primary arterial vasodilation in the splanchnic circulation, resulting ultimately in activation of vasoconstrictor responses similar to those seen in hypovolemia. AKI is a common complication in this setting, and it can be triggered by volume depletion and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. A particularly poor prognosis is seen in the case of type 1 hepatorenal syndrome, in which AKI without an alternate cause (e.g., infection, shock, nephrotoxic drugs) persists despite volume administration and withholding of diuretics. Type 2 hepatorenal syndrome is a less severe form characterized mainly by refractory ascites.

Intrinsic Aki

The most common causes of intrinsic AKI are sepsis, ischemia, and nephrotoxins, both endogenous and exogenous (Fig. 279-3). In many cases, prerenal azotemia advances to tubular injury. Although classically termed "acute tubular necrosis," human biopsy confirmation of tubular necrosis is, in general, lacking in cases of sepsis and ischemia; indeed, processes such as inflammation, apoptosis, and altered regional perfusion may be more relevant pathophysiologically. Other causes of intrinsic AKI are less common and can be conceptualized anatomically according to the major site of renal parenchymal damage: glomeruli, tubulointerstitium, and vessels.

Sepsis-Associated Aki

In the United States, more than 700,000 cases of sepsis occur each year. AKI complicates more than 50% of cases of severe sepsis, and greatly increases the risk of death. Sepsis is also a very important cause of AKI in the developing world. Decreases in GFR with sepsis can occur even in the absence of overt hypotension, although most cases of severe AKI typically occur in the setting of hemodynamic collapse requiring vasopressor support. While there is clearly tubular injury associated with AKI in sepsis as manifest by the presence of tubular debris and casts in the urine, postmortem examinations of kidneys from individuals with severe sepsis suggest that other factors, perhaps related to inflammation and interstitial edema, must be considered in the pathophysiology of sepsis-induced AKI.

The hemodynamic effects of sepsis〞arising from generalized arterial vasodilation, mediated in part by cytokines that upregulate the expression of inducible NO synthase in the vasculature〞can lead to a reduction in GFR. The operative mechanisms may be excessive efferent arteriole vasodilation, particularly early in the course of sepsis, or renal vasoconstriction from activation of the sympathetic nervous system, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, vasopressin, and endothelin. Sepsis may lead to endothelial damage, which results in microvascular thrombosis, activation of reactive oxygen species, and leukocyte adhesion and migration, all of which may injure renal tubular cells.

Ischemia-Associated Aki

Healthy kidneys receive 20% of the cardiac output and account for 10% of resting oxygen consumption, despite constituting only 0.5% of the human body mass. The kidneys are also the site of one of the most hypoxic regions in the body, the renal medulla. The outer medulla is particularly vulnerable to ischemic damage because of the architecture of the blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to the tubules. Enhanced leukocyte-endothelial interactions in the small vessels lead to inflammation and reduced local blood flow to the metabolically very active S3 segment of the proximal tubule, which depends on oxidative metabolism for survival. Ischemia alone in a normal kidney is usually not sufficient to cause severe AKI, as evidenced by the relatively low risk of severe AKI even after total interruption of renal blood flow during suprarenal aortic clamping or cardiac arrest. Clinically, AKI more commonly develops when ischemia occurs in the context of limited renal reserve (e.g., chronic kidney disease or older age) or coexisting insults such as sepsis, vasoactive or nephrotoxic drugs, rhabdomyolysis, and the systemic inflammatory states associated with burns and pancreatitis. Prerenal azotemia and ischemia-associated AKI represent a continuum of the manifestations of renal hypoperfusion. Persistent preglomerular vasoconstriction may be a common underlying cause of the reduction in GFR seen in AKI; implicated factors for vasoconstriction include activation of tubuloglomerular feedback from enhanced delivery of solute to the macula densa following proximal tubule injury, increased basal vascular tone and reactivity to vasoconstrictive agents, and decreased vasodilator responsiveness. Other contributors to low GFR include backleak of filtrate across ischemic and denuded tubular epithelium and mechanical obstruction of tubules from necrotic debris (Fig. 279-4).

Postoperative Aki

Ischemia-associated AKI is a serious complication in the postoperative period, especially after major operations involving significant blood loss and intraoperative hypotension. The procedures most commonly associated with AKI are cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (particularly for combined valve and bypass procedures), vascular procedures with aortic cross clamping, and intraperitoneal procedures. Severe AKI requiring dialysis occurs in approximately 1% of cardiac and vascular surgery procedures. The risk of severe AKI has been less well studied for major intra peritoneal procedures, but appears to be of comparable magnitude. Common risk factors for postoperative AKI include underlying chronic kidney disease, older age, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and emergency procedures. The pathophysiology of AKI following cardiac surgery is multifactorial. Major AKI risk factors are common in the population undergoing cardiac surgery. The use of nephrotoxic agents including iodinated contrast for cardiac imaging prior to surgery may increase the risk of AKI. Cardiopulmonary bypass is a unique hemodynamic state characterized by nonpulsatile flow and exposure of the circulation to extracorporeal circuits. Longer duration of cardiopulmonary bypass is a risk factor for AKI. In addition to ischemic injury from sustained hypoperfusion, cardiopulmonary bypass may cause AKI through a number of mechanisms including extracorporeal circuit activation of leukocytes and inflammatory processes, hemolysis with resultant pigment nephropathy (see below), and aortic injury with resultant atheroemboli. AKI from atheroembolic disease, which can also occur following percutaneous catheterization of the aorta, or spontaneously, is due to cholesterol crystal embolization resulting in partial or total occlusion of multiple small arteries within the kidney. Over time, a foreign body reaction can result in intimal proliferation, giant cell formation, and further narrowing of the vascular lumen, accounting for the generally subacute (over a period of weeks rather than days) decline in renal function.

Burns and Acute Pancreatitis

Extensive fluid losses into the extravascular compartments of the body frequently accompany severe burns and acute pancreatitis. AKI is an ominous complication of burns, affecting 25% of individuals with more than 10% total body surface area involvement. In addition to severe hypovolemia resulting in decreased cardiac output and increased neurohormonal activation, burns and acute pancreatitis both lead to dysregulated inflammation and an increased risk of sepsis and acute lung injury, all of which may facilitate the development and progression of AKI. Individuals undergoing massive fluid resuscitation for trauma, burns, and acute pancreatitis can also develop the abdominal compartment syndrome, where markedly elevated intraabdominal pressures, usually higher than 20 mmHg, lead to renal vein compression and reduced GFR.

Diseases of the Microvasculature Leading to Ischemia

Microvascular causes of AKI include the thrombotic microangiopathies [antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, radiation nephritis, malignant nephrosclerosis, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS)], scleroderma, and atheroembolic disease. Large vessel diseases associated with AKI include renal artery dissection, thromboembolism, thrombosis, and renal vein compression or thrombosis.

Nephrotoxin-Associated Aki

The kidney has very high susceptibility to nephrotoxicity due to extremely high blood perfusion and concentration of circulating substances along the nephron where water is reabsorbed and in the medullary interstitium; this results in high-concentration exposure of toxins to tubular, interstitial, and endothelial cells. Nephrotoxic injury occurs in response to a number of pharmacologic compounds with diverse structures, endogenous substances, and environmental exposures. All structures of the kidney are vulnerable to toxic injury, including the tubules, interstitium, vasculature, and collecting system. As with other forms of AKI, risk factors for nephrotoxicity include older age, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and prerenal azotemia. Hypoalbuminemia may increase the risk of some forms of nephrotoxin-associated AKI due to increased free circulating drug concentrations.

Contrast Agents

Iodinated contrast agents used for cardiovascular and CT imaging are a leading cause of AKI. The risk of AKI, or "contrast nephropathy," is negligible in those with normal renal function but increases markedly in the setting of chronic kidney disease, particularly diabetic nephropathy. The most common clinical course of contrast nephropathy is characterized by a rise in SCr beginning 24每48 hours following exposure, peaking within 3每5 days, and resolving within 1 week. More severe, dialysis-requiring AKI is uncommon except in the setting of significant preexisting chronic kidney disease, often in association with congestive heart failure or other coexisting causes for ischemia-associated AKI. Patients with multiple myeloma and renal disease are particularly susceptible. Low fractional excretion of sodium and relatively benign urinary sediment without features of tubular necrosis (see below) are common findings. Contrast nephropathy is thought to occur from a combination of factors, including (1) hypoxia in the renal outer medulla due to perturbations in renal microcirculation and occlusion of small vessels; (2) cytotoxic damage to the tubules directly or via the generation of oxygen free radicals, especially since the concentration of the agent within the tubule is markedly increased; and (3) transient tubule obstruction with precipitated contrast material. Other diagnostic agents implicated as a cause of AKI are high-dose gadolinium used for MRI and oral sodium phosphate solutions used as bowel purgatives.

Antibiotics

Several antimicrobial agents are commonly associated with AKI. Aminoglycosides andamphotericin B both cause tubular necrosis. Nonoliguric AKI (i.e., without a significant reduction in urine volume) accompanies 10每30% of courses of aminoglycoside antibiotics, even when plasma levels are in the therapeutic range. Aminoglycosides are freely filtered across the glomerulus and then accumulate within the renal cortex, where concentrations can greatly exceed those of the plasma. AKI typically manifests after 5每7 days of therapy and can present even after the drug has been discontinued. Hypomagnesemia is a common finding.

Amphotericin B causes renal vasoconstriction from an increase in tubuloglomerular feedback as well as direct tubular toxicity mediated by reactive oxygen species. Nephrotoxicity from amphotericin B is dose and duration dependent. This drug binds to tubular membrane cholesterol and introduces pores. Clinical features of amphotericin B nephrotoxicity include polyuria, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and nongap metabolic acidosis.

Vancomycin may be associated with AKI, particularly when trough levels are high, but a causal relationship with AKI has not been definitively established. Acyclovir can precipitate in tubules and cause AKI by tubular obstruction, particularly when given as an intravenous bolus at high doses (500 mg/m2) or in the setting of hypovolemia. Foscarnet, pentamidine, and cidofovir (less commonly prescribed antimicrobials) are also frequently associated with AKI due to tubular toxicity. AKI secondary to acute interstitial nephritis can occur as a consequence of a number of antibiotics, including penicillins, cephalosporins, quinolones, sulfonamides, and rifampin.

Chemotherapeutic Agents

Cisplatin and carboplatin are accumulated by proximal tubular cells and cause necrosis and apoptosis. Intensive hydration regimens have reduced the incidence of cisplatin nephrotoxicity, but it remains a dose-limiting toxicity. Ifosfamide may cause hemorrhagic cystitis and tubular toxicity, manifested as Type II renal tubular acidosis (Fanconi's syndrome), polyuria, hypokalemia, and a modest decline in GFR. Antiangiogenesis agents such as bevacizumab, can cause proteinuria and hypertension via injury to the glomerular microvasculature (thrombotic microangiopathy). Other antineoplastic agents such as mitomycin C and gemcitabine may cause thrombotic microangiopathy with resultant AKI.

Toxic Ingestions

Ethylene glycol, present in automobile antifreeze, is metabolized to oxalic acid, glycolaldehyde, and glyoxylate, which may cause AKI through direct tubular injury. Diethylene glycol is an industrial agent that has been the cause of outbreaks of severe AKI around the world due to adulteration of pharmaceutical preparations. The metabolite 2-hydroxyethoxyacetic acid (HEAA) is thought to be responsible for tubular injury. Melamine contamination of foodstuffs has led to nephrolithiasis and AKI, either through intratubular obstruction or possibly direct tubular toxicity. Aristolochic acid was found to be the cause of "Chinese herb nephropathy" and "Balkan nephropathy" due to contamination of medicinal herbs or farming. The list of environmental toxins is likely to grow and contribute to a better understanding of previously catalogued "idiopathic" chronic tubular interstitial disease, a common diagnosis in both the developed and developing world.

Endogenous Toxins

AKI may be caused by a number of endogenous compounds, including myoglobin, hemoglobin, uric acid, and myeloma light chains. Myoglobin can be released by injured muscle cells, and hemoglobin can be released during massive hemolysis leading to pigment nephropathy. Rhabdomyolysis may result from traumatic crush injuries, muscle ischemia during vascular or orthopedic surgery, compression during coma or immobilization, prolonged seizure activity, excessive exercise, heat stroke or malignant hyperthermia, infections, metabolic disorders (e.g., hypophosphatemia, severe hypothyroidism), and myopathies (drug-induced, metabolic, or inflammatory). Pathogenic factors for AKI include intrarenal vasoconstriction, direct proximal tubular toxicity, and mechanical obstruction of the distal nephron lumen when myoglobin or hemoglobin precipitates with Tamm-Horsfall protein (uromodulin, the most common protein in urine and produced in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle), a process favored by acidic urine. Tumor lysis syndrome may follow initiation of cytotoxic therapy in patients with high-grade lymphomas and acute lymphoblastic leukemia; massive release of uric acid (with serum levels often exceeding 15 mg/dL) leads to precipitation of uric acid in the renal tubules and AKI (Chap. 276). Other features of tumor lysis syndrome include hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia. The tumor lysis syndrome can also occasionally occur spontaneously or with treatment for solid tumors or multiple myeloma. Myeloma light chains can also cause AKI by direct tubular toxicity and by binding to Tamm-Horsfall protein to form obstructing intratubular casts. Hypercalcemia, which can also be seen in multiple myeloma, may cause AKI by intense renal vasoconstriction and volume depletion.

Allergic Acute Tubulointerstitial Disease and Other Causes of Intrinsic Aki

While many of the ischemic and toxic causes of AKI previously described result in tubulointerstitial disease, many drugs are also associated with the development of an allergic response characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate and often peripheral and urinary eosinophilia. AKI may be caused by severe infections and infiltrative diseases. Diseases of the glomeruli or vasculature can lead to AKI by compromising blood flow within the renal circulation. Glomerulonephritis or vasculitis are relatively uncommon but potentially severe causes of AKI that may necessitate timely treatment with immunosuppressive agents or therapeutic plasma exchange.

Postrenal Acute Kidney Injury

(See also Chap. 289) Postrenal AKI occurs when the normally unidirectional flow of urine is acutely blocked either partially or totally, leading to increased retrograde hydrostatic pressure and interference with glomerular filtration. Obstruction to urinary flow may be caused by functional or structural derangements anywhere from the renal pelvis to the tip of the urethra (Fig. 279-5). Normal urinary flow rate does not rule out the presence of partial obstruction, since the GFR is normally two orders of magnitude higher than the urinary flow rate. For AKI to occur in healthy individuals, obstruction must affect both kidneys unless only one kidney is functional, in which case unilateral obstruction can cause AKI. Unilateral obstruction may cause AKI in the setting of significant underlying CKD or in rare cases from reflex vasospasm of the contralateral kidney. Bladder neck obstruction is a common cause of postrenal AKI and can be due to prostate disease (benign prostatic hypertrophy or prostate cancer), neurogenic bladder, or therapy with anticholinergic drugs. Obstructed Foley catheters can cause postrenal AKI if not recognized and relieved. Other causes of lower tract obstruction are blood clots, calculi, and urethral strictures. Ureteric obstruction can occur from intraluminal obstruction (e.g., calculi, blood clots, sloughed renal papillae), infiltration of the ureteric wall (e.g., neoplasia), or external compression (e.g., retroperitoneal fibrosis, neoplasia, abscess, or inadvertent surgical damage). The pathophysiology of postrenal AKI involves hemodynamic alterations triggered by an abrupt increase in intratubular pressures. An initial period of hyperemia from afferent arteriolar dilation is followed by intrarenal vasoconstriction from the generation of angiotensin II, thromboxane A2, and vasopressin, and a reduction in NO production. Reduced GFR is due to underperfusion of glomeruli and, possibly, changes in the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient.

Diagnostic Evaluation (Table 279-1)

The presence of AKI is usually inferred by an elevation in the SCr concentration. AKI is currently defined by a rise of at least 0.3 mg/dL or 50% higher than baseline within a 24每48-hours period or a reduction in urine output to 0.5 mL/kg per hour for longer than 6 hours. It is important to recognize that given this definition, some patients with AKI will not have tubular or glomerular damage (e.g., prerenal azotemia). The distinction between AKI and chronic kidney disease is important for proper diagnosis and treatment. The distinction is straightforward when a recent baseline SCr concentration is available, but more difficult in the many instances in which the baseline is unknown. In such cases, clues suggestive of chronic kidney disease can come from radiologic studies (e.g., small, shrunken kidneys with cortical thinning on renal ultrasound, or evidence of renal osteodystrophy) or laboratory tests such as normocytic anemia or secondary hyperparathyroidism with hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia, consistent with CKD. No set of tests, however, can rule out AKI superimposed on CKD since AKI is a frequent complication in patients with CKD, further complicating the distinction. Serial blood tests showing continued substantial rise of SCr is clear evidence of AKI. Once the diagnosis of AKI is established, its cause needs to be determined.

History and Physical Examination

The clinical context, careful history taking, and physical examination often narrow the differential diagnosis for the cause of AKI. Prerenal azotemia should be suspected in the setting of vomiting, diarrhea, glycosuria causing polyuria, and several medications including diuretics, NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs. Physical signs of orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, reduced jugular venous pressure, decreased skin turgor, and dry mucous membranes are often present in prerenal azotemia. A history of prostatic disease, nephrolithiasis, or pelvic or paraaortic malignancy would suggest the possibility of postrenal AKI. Whether or not symptoms are present early during obstruction of the urinary tract depends on the location of obstruction. Colicky flank pain radiating to the groin suggests acute ureteric obstruction. Nocturia and urinary frequency or hesitancy can be seen in prostatic disease. Abdominal fullness and suprapubic pain can accompany massive bladder enlargement. Definitive diagnosis of obstruction requires radiologic investigations.

A careful review of all medications is imperative in the evaluation of an individual with AKI. Not only are medications frequently a cause of AKI but doses of administered medications must be adjusted for estimated GFR. Idiosyncratic reactions to a wide variety of medications can lead to allergic interstitial nephritis, which may be accompanied by fever, arthralgias, and a pruritic erythematous rash. The absence of systemic features of hypersensitivity, however, does not exclude the diagnosis of interstitial nephritis.

AKI accompanied by palpable purpura, pulmonary hemorrhage, or sinusitis raises the possibility of systemic vasculitis with glomerulonephritis. Atheroembolic disease can be associated with livedo reticularis and other signs of emboli to the legs. A tense abdomen should prompt consideration of acute abdominal compartment syndrome, which requires measurement of bladder pressure. Signs of limb ischemia may be clues to the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis.

Urine Findings

Complete anuria early in the course of AKI is uncommon except in the following situations: complete urinary tract obstruction, renal artery occlusion, overwhelming septic shock, severe ischemia (often with cortical necrosis), or severe proliferative glomerulonephritis or vasculitis. A reduction in urine output (oliguria, defined as <400 mL/24 h) usually denotes more significant AKI (i.e., lower GFR) than when urine output is preserved. Oliguria is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Preserved urine output can be seen in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus characteristic of longstanding urinary tract obstruction, tubulointerstitial disease, or nephrotoxicity from cisplatin or aminoglycosides, among other causes. Red or brown urine may be seen with or without gross hematuria; if the color persists in the supernatant after centrifugation, then pigment nephropathy from rhabdomyolysis or hemolysis should be suspected.

The urinalysis and urine sediment examination are invaluable tools, but they require clinical correlation because of generally limited sensitivity and specificity (Fig. 279-6) (Chap. e14). In the absence of preexisting proteinuria from CKD, AKI from ischemia or nephrotoxins leads to mild proteinuria (<1 g/d). Greater proteinuria in AKI suggests damage to the glomerular ultrafiltration barrier or excretion of myeloma light chains; the latter are not detected with conventional urine dipsticks (which detect albumin) and require the sulfosalicylic acid test or immunoelectrophoresis. Atheroemboli can cause a variable degree of proteinuria. Extremely heavy proteinuria ("nephrotic range," >3.5 g/d) can occasionally be seen in glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, or interstitial nephritis (particularly from NSAIDs). AKI can also complicate cases of minimal change disease, a cause of the nephrotic syndrome (Chap. 277). If the dipstick is positive for hemoglobin but few red blood cells are evident in the urine sediment, then rhabdomyolysis or hemolysis should be suspected.

Prerenal azotemia may present with hyaline casts or an unremarkable urine sediment exam. Postrenal AKI may also lead to an unremarkable sediment, but hematuria and pyuria may be seen depending on the cause of obstruction. AKI from ATN due to ischemic injury, sepsis, or certain nephrotoxins has characteristic urine sediment findings: pigmented "muddy brown" granular casts and tubular epithelial cell casts. These findings may be absent in more than 20% of cases, however. Glomerulonephritis may lead to dysmorphic red blood cells or red blood cell casts. Interstitial nephritis may lead to white blood cell casts. The urine sediment findings overlap somewhat in glomerulonephritis and interstitial nephritis, and a diagnosis is not always possible on the basis of the urine sediment alone. Urine eosinophils have a limited role in differential diagnosis; they can be seen in interstitial nephritis, pyelonephritis, cystitis, atheroembolic disease, or glomerulonephritis. Crystalluria may be important diagnostically. The finding of oxalate crystals in AKI should prompt an evaluation for ethylene glycol toxicity. Abundant uric acid crystals may be seen in the tumor lysis syndrome.

Blood Laboratory Findings

Certain forms of AKI are associated with characteristic patterns in the rise and fall of SCr. Prerenal azotemia typically leads to modest rises in SCr that return to baseline with improvement in hemodynamic status. Contrast nephropathy leads to a rise in SCr within 24每48 hours, peak within 3每5 days, and resolution within 5每7 days. In comparison, atheroembolic disease usually manifests with more subacute rises in SCr, although severe AKI with rapid increases in SCr can occur in this setting. With many of the epithelial cell toxins such as aminoglycoside antibiotics and cisplatin, the rise in SCr is characteristically delayed for 4每5 days to 2 weeks after initial exposure.

A complete blood count may provide diagnostic clues. Anemia is common in AKI and is usually multifactorial in origin. It is not related to an effect of AKI solely on production of red blood cells since this effect in isolation takes longer to manifest. Severe anemia in the absence of bleeding may reflect hemolysis, multiple myeloma, or thrombotic microangiopathy (e.g., HUS or TTP). Other laboratory findings of thrombotic microangiopathy include thrombocytopenia, schistocytes on peripheral blood smear, elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, and low haptoglobin content. Peripheral eosinophilia can accompany interstitial nephritis, atheroembolic disease, polyarteritis nodosa, and Churg-Strauss vasculitis.

AKI often leads to hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. Marked hyperphosphatemia with accompanying hypocalcemia, however, suggests rhabdomyolysis or the tumor lysis syndrome. Creatinine phosphokinase levels and serum uric acid are elevated in rhabdomyolysis, while tumor lysis syndrome shows normal or marginally elevated creatine kinase and markedly elevated serum uric acid. The anion gap may be increased with any cause of uremia due to retention of anions such as phosphate, hippurate, sulfate, and urate. The co-occurrence of an increased anion gap and an osmolal gap may suggest ethylene glycol poisoning, which may also cause oxalate crystalluria. Low anion gap may provide a clue to the diagnosis of multiple myeloma due to the presence of unmeasured cationic proteins. Laboratory blood tests helpful for the diagnosis of glomerulonephritis and vasculitis include depressed complement levels and high titers of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs), antiglomerular basement membrane (AGBM) antibodies, and cryoglobulins.

Radiologic Evaluation

Postrenal AKI should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of AKI because treatment is usually successful if instituted early. Simple bladder catheterization can rule out urethral obstruction. Imaging of the urinary tract with renal ultrasound or CT should be undertaken to investigate obstruction in individuals with AKI unless an alternate diagnosis is apparent. Findings of obstruction include dilation of the collecting system and hydroureteronephrosis. Obstruction can be present without radiologic abnormalities in the setting of volume depletion, retroperitoneal fibrosis, encasement with tumor, and also early in the course of obstruction. If a high clinical index of suspicion for obstruction persists despite normal imaging, antegrade or retrograde pyelography should be performed. Imaging may also provide additional helpful information about kidney size and echogenicity to assist in the distinction between acute versus CKD. Large kidneys observed in these studies suggest the possibility of diabetic nephropathy, HIV-associated nephropathy, infiltrative diseases, or occasionally acute interstitial nephritis. Vascular imaging may be useful if venous or arterial obstruction is suspected, but the risks of contrast administration should be kept in mind. MRI with gadolinium-based contrast agents should be avoided if possible in severe AKI due to the possibility of inducing nephrogenic system fibrosis, a rare but serious complication seen most commonly in patients with end-stage renal disease.

Renal Failure Indices

Several indices have been used to help differentiate prerenal azotemia from intrinsic AKI when the tubules are malfunctioning. The low tubular flow rate and increased recycling of urea seen in prerenal azotemia may cause a disproportionate elevation of the BUN compared to creatinine. Other causes of disproportionate BUN elevation need to be kept in mind, however, including upper gastrointestinal bleeding, hyperalimentation, increased tissue catabolism, and glucocorticoid use.

The fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is the fraction of the filtered sodium load that is reabsorbed by the tubules and is a measure of both the kidney's ability to reabsorb sodium as well as endogenously and exogenously administered factors that affect tubular reabsorption. As such, it depends on sodium intake, effective intravascular volume, GFR, and intact tubular reabsorptive mechanisms. With prerenal azotemia, the FeNa may be below 1%, suggesting avid tubular sodium reabsorption. In patients with CKD, a FeNa significantly above 1% can still be present despite a prerenal state. The FeNa may also be above 1% despite hypovolemia due to treatment with diuretics. Low FeNa is often seen in glomerulonephritis (and other disorders), and, hence, should not be taken as prima facie evidence of prerenal azotemia. Low FeNa is therefore suggestive but not synonymous with effective intravascular volume depletion, and should not be used as the sole guide for volume management. The response of urine output to crystalloid or colloid fluid administration may be both diagnostic and therapeutic in prerenal azotemia. In ischemic AKI, the FeNa is frequently above 1% because of tubular injury and resultant inability to reabsorb sodium. Several causes of ischemia-associated and nephrotoxin-associated AKI can present with FeNa below 1%, however, including sepsis (often early in the course), rhabdomyolysis, and contrast nephropathy.

The ability of the kidneys to produce a concentrated urine is dependent upon many factors and reliant on good tubular function in multiple regions of the kidney. In the patient not taking diuretics and with good baseline kidney function, urine osmolality may be above 500 mOsm/kg in prerenal azotemia, consistent with an intact medullary gradient and elevated serum vasopressin levels causing water reabsorption resulting in concentrated urine. In elderly patients and those with CKD, however, baseline concentrating defects may exist, making urinary osmolality unreliable in many instances. Loss of concentrating ability is common in septic or ischemic AKI, resulting in urine osmolality below 350 mOsm/kg, but the finding is not specific.

Kidney Biopsy

If the cause of AKI is not apparent based on the clinical context, physical examination, and laboratory studies, kidney biopsy should be considered. The results of kidney biopsy can provide definitive diagnostic and prognostic information about acute and CKDs. The procedure is most often used in AKI when prerenal azotemia, postrenal AKI, and ischemic or nephrotoxic AKI have been deemed unlikely, and other possible diagnoses are being considered such as glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, interstitial nephritis, myeloma kidney, HUS and TTP, and allograft dysfunction. Kidney biopsy is associated with a risk of bleeding, which can be severe and organ or life threatening in patients with thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy.

Novel Biomarkers

BUN and creatinine are functional biomarkers of glomerular filtration rather than tissue injury biomarkers and, therefore, may be suboptimal for the diagnosis of actual parenchymal kidney damage. BUN and creatinine are also relatively slow to rise after kidney injury. Several novel kidney injury biomarkers have been investigated and show great promise for the early and accurate diagnosis of AKI. Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) is a type 1 transmembrane protein that is abundantly expressed in proximal tubular cells injured by ischemia or nephrotoxins such as cisplatin. KIM-1 is not expressed in appreciable quantities in the absence of tubular injury or in extrarenal tissues. KIM-1's functional role may be to confer phagocytic properties to tubular cells, enabling them to clear debris from the tubular lumen after kidney injury. KIM-1 can be detected shortly after ischemic or nephrotoxic injury in the urine and, therefore, may be an easily tested biomarker in the clinical setting. Neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL, also known as lipocalin-2 or siderocalin) is another leading novel biomarker of AKI. NGAL was first discovered as a protein in granules of human neutrophils. NGAL can bind to iron siderophore complexes and may have tissue-protective effects in the proximal tubule. NGAL is highly upregulated after inflammation and kidney injury and can be detected in the plasma and urine within 2 hours of cardiopulmonary bypass每associated AKI. Other injury markers that are being studied in an attempt to increase the early recognition of injury and predict the outcome in AKI are listed in Table 279-2.

Complications

The kidney plays a central role in homeostatic control of volume status, blood pressure, plasma electrolyte composition, and acid-base balance, and for excretion of nitrogenous and other waste products. Complications associated with AKI are, therefore, protean, and depend on the severity of AKI and other associated conditions. Mild to moderate AKI may be entirely asymptomatic, particularly early in the course.

Uremia

Buildup of nitrogenous waste products, manifested as an elevated BUN concentration, is a hallmark of AKI. BUN itself poses little direct toxicity at levels below 100 mg/dL. At higher concentrations, mental status changes and bleeding complications can arise. Other toxins normally cleared by the kidney may be responsible for the symptom complex known as uremia. Few of the many possible uremic toxins have been definitively identified. The correlation of BUN and SCr concentrations with uremic symptoms is extremely variable, due in part to differences in urea and creatinine generation rates across individuals.

Hypervolemia and Hypovolemia

Expansion of extracellular fluid volume is a major complication of oliguric and anuric AKI, due to impaired salt and water excretion. The result can be weight gain, dependent edema, increased jugular venous pressure, and pulmonary edema; the latter can be life threatening. Pulmonary edema can also occur from volume overload and hemorrhage in pulmonary renal syndromes. AKI may also induce or exacerbate acute lung injury characterized by increased vascular permeability and inflammatory cell infiltration in lung parenchyma. Recovery from AKI can sometimes be accompanied by polyuria, which, if untreated, can lead to significant volume depletion. The polyuric phase of recovery may be due to an osmotic diuresis from retained urea and other waste products as well as delayed recovery of tubular reabsorptive functions.

Hyponatremia

Administration of excessive hypotonic crystalloid or isotonic dextrose solutions can result in hypoosmolality and hyponatremia, which, if severe, can cause neurologic abnormalities, including seizures.

Hyperkalemia

Abnormalities in plasma electrolyte composition can be mild or life threatening. Frequently the most concerning complication of AKI is hyperkalemia. Marked hyperkalemia is particularly common in rhabdomyolysis, hemolysis, and tumor lysis syndrome due to release of intracellular potassium from damaged cells. Potassium affects the cellular membrane potential of cardiac and neuromuscular tissues. Muscle weakness may be a symptom of hyperkalemia. The more serious complication of hyperkalemia is due to effects on cardiac conduction, leading to potentially fatal arrhythmias.

Acidosis

Metabolic acidosis, usually accompanied by an elevation in the anion gap, is common in AKI, and can further complicate acid-base and potassium balance in individuals with other causes of acidosis, including sepsis, diabetic ketoacidosis, or respiratory acidosis.

Hyperphosphatemia and Hypocalcemia

AKI can lead to hyperphosphatemia, particularly in highly catabolic patients or those with AKI from rhabdomyolysis, hemolysis, and tumor lysis syndrome. Metastatic deposition of calcium phosphate can lead to hypocalcemia. AKI-associated hypocalcemia may also arise from derangements in the vitamin D每parathyroid axis. Hypocalcemia is often asymptomatic but can lead to perioral paresthesias, muscle cramps, seizures, carpopedal spasms, and prolongation of the QT interval on electrocardiography. Calcium levels should be corrected for the degree of hypoalbuminemia, if present, or ionized calcium levels should be followed. Mild, asymptomatic hypocalcemia does not require treatment.

Bleeding

Hematologic complications of AKI include anemia and bleeding, both of which are exacerbated by coexisting disease processes such as sepsis, liver disease, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Direct hematologic effects from AKI-related uremia include decreased erythropoiesis and platelet dysfunction.

Infections

Infections are a common precipitant of AKI and also a dreaded complication of AKI. Impaired host immunity has been described in end-stage renal disease and may be operative in severe AKI.

Cardiac Complications

The major cardiac complications of AKI are arrhythmias, pericarditis, and pericardial effusion.

Malnutrition

AKI is often a severely hypercatabolic state, and, therefore, malnutrition is a major complication.

Treatment: Acute Kidney Injury

Prevention and Treatment

The management of individuals with and at risk for AKI varies according to the underlying cause (Table 279-3). Common to all are several principles. Optimization of hemodynamics, correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalances, discontinuation of nephrotoxic medications, and dose adjustment of administered medications are all critical. Common causes of AKI such as sepsis and ischemic ATN, do not yet have specific therapies once injury is established, but meticulous clinical attention is needed to support the patient until (if) AKI resolves. The kidney possesses remarkable capacity to repair itself after even severe, dialysis-requiring AKI. However, some patients with AKI do not recover fully and may remain dialysis dependent.

Prerenal Azotemia

Prevention and treatment of prerenal azotemia requires optimization of renal perfusion. The composition of replacement fluids should be targeted to the type of fluid lost. Severe acute blood loss should be treated with packed red blood cells. Isotonic crystalloid and/or colloid should be used for less severe acute hemorrhage or plasma loss in the case of burns and pancreatitis. Crystalloid solutions are less expensive and probably equally efficacious as colloid solutions. Crystalloid has been reported to be preferable to albumin in the setting of traumatic brain injury. Isotonic crystalloid (e.g., 0.9% saline) or colloid should be used for volume resuscitation in severe hypovolemia, whereas hypotonic crystalloids (e.g., 0.45% saline) suffice for less severe hypovolemia. Excessive chloride administration from 0.9% saline may lead to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Use of bicarbonate-containing solutions (e.g., dextrose water with 150 mEq sodium bicarbonate) should be used if metabolic acidosis is a concern.

Optimization of cardiac function in the cardiorenal syndrome (i.e., renal hypoperfusion from poor cardiac output) may require use of inotropic agents, preload- and afterload-reducing agents, antiarrhythmic drugs, and mechanical aids such as an intraaortic balloon pump. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring to guide therapy may be necessary.

Cirrhosis and Hepatorenal Syndrome

Fluid management in individuals with cirrhosis, ascites, and AKI is challenging because of the frequent difficulty in ascertaining intravascular volume status. Administration of intravenous fluids as a volume challenge may be required diagnostically as well as therapeutically. Excessive volume administration may, however, result in worsening ascites and pulmonary compromise in the setting of hepatorenal syndrome or AKI due to superimposed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Peritonitis should be ruled out by culture of ascitic fluid. Albumin may prevent AKI in those treated with antibiotics for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The definitive treatment of the hepatorenal syndrome is orthotopic liver transplantation. Bridge therapies that have shown promise include terlipressin (a vasopressin analog), combination therapy with octreotide (a somatostatin analog) and midodrine (an 1-adrenergic agonist), and norepinephrine, all in combination with intravenous albumin (25每50 mg per day, maximum 100 g/d).

Intrinsic Aki

Several agents have been tested and have failed to show benefit in the treatment of ischemic acute tubular injury. These include atrial natriuretic peptide, low-dose dopamine, endothelin antagonists, loop diuretics, calcium channel blockers, -adrenergic receptor blockers, prostaglandin analogs, antioxidants, antibodies against leukocyte adhesion molecules, and insulin-like growth factor and many others. Most studies have enrolled patients with severe and well-established AKI, and treatment may have been initiated too late. Novel kidney injury biomarkers may provide an opportunity to test agents earlier in the course of AKI.

AKI due to acute glomerulonephritis or vasculitis may respond to immunosuppressive agents and/or plasmapheresis (Chap. 277). Allergic interstitial nephritis due to medications requires discontinuation of the offending agent. Glucocorticoids have been used, but not tested in randomized trials, in cases where AKI persists or worsens despite discontinuation of the suspected medication. AKI due to scleroderma (scleroderma renal crisis) should be treated with ACE inhibitors.

Early and aggressive volume repletion is mandatory in patients with rhabdomyolysis, who may require 10 L of fluid per day. Alkaline fluids (e.g., 75 mmol sodium bicarbonate added to 0.45% saline) may be beneficial in preventing tubular injury and cast formation, but carry the risk of worsening hypocalcemia. Diuretics may be used if fluid repletion is adequate but unsuccessful in achieving urinary flow rates of 200每300 mL/h. There is no specific therapy for established AKI in rhabdomyolysis, other than dialysis in severe cases or general supportive care to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance and tissue perfusion. Careful attention must be focused on calcium and phosphate status because of precipitation in damaged tissue and released when the tissue heals.

Postrenal Aki

Prompt recognition and relief of urinary tract obstruction can forestall the development of permanent structural damage induced by urinary stasis. The site of obstruction defines the treatment approach. Transurethral or suprapubic bladder catheterization may be all that is needed initially for urethral strictures or functional bladder impairment. Ureteric obstruction may be treated by percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement or ureteral stent placement. Relief of obstruction is usually followed by an appropriate diuresis for several days. In rare cases, severe polyuria persists due to tubular dysfunction and may require continued administration of intravenous fluids and electrolytes for a period of time.

Supportive Measures

Volume Management

Hypervolemia in oliguric or anuric AKI may be life threatening due to acute pulmonary edema, especially since many patients have coexisting pulmonary disease, and AKI likely increases pulmonary vascular permeability. Fluid and sodium should be restricted, and diuretics may be used to increase the urinary flow rate. There is no evidence that increasing urine output itself improves the natural history of AKI, but diuretics may help to avoid the need for dialysis in some cases. In severe cases of volume overload, furosemide may be given as a bolus (200 mg) followed by an intravenous drip (10每40 mg/h), with or without a thiazide diuretic. Diuretic therapy should be stopped if there is no response. Dopamine in low doses may transiently increase salt and water excretion by the kidney in prerenal states, but clinical trials have failed to show any benefit in patients with intrinsic AKI. Because of the risk of arrhythmias and potential bowel ischemia, it has been argued that the risks of dopamine may outweigh the benefits in the treatment or prevention of AKI.

Electrolyte and Acid-Base Abnormalities

The treatment of dysnatremias and hyperkalemia is described in Chap. 45. Metabolic acidosis is not treated unless severe (pH <7.20 and serum bicarbonate <15 mmol/L). Acidosis can be treated with oral or intravenous sodium bicarbonate (Chap. 47), but overcorrection should be avoided because of the possibility of metabolic alkalosis, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and volume overload. Hyperphosphatemia is common in AKI and can usually be treated by limiting intestinal absorption of phosphate using phosphate binders (calcium carbonate, calcium acetate, sevelamer, or aluminum hydroxide). Hypocalcemia does not usually require therapy unless symptoms are present.

Malnutrition

Protein energy wasting is common in AKI, particularly in the setting of multisystem organ failure. Inadequate nutrition may lead to starvation ketoacidosis and protein catabolism. Excessive nutrition may increase the generation of nitrogenous waste and lead to worsening azotemia. Total parenteral nutrition requires large volumes of fluid administration and may complicate efforts at volume control.

Anemia

The anemia seen in AKI is usually multifactorial and is not improved by erythropoiesis stimulating agents, due to their delayed onset of action and the presence of bone marrow resistance in critically ill patients. Uremic bleeding may respond to desmopressin or estrogens, but may require dialysis in the case of longstanding or severe uremia. Gastrointestinal prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors or histamine (H2) receptor blockers is required. Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis is important and should be tailored to the clinical setting; low-molecular-weight heparins and factor Xa inhibitors have unpredictable pharmacokinetics in severe AKI and should be avoided.

Dialysis Indications and Modalities

(See also Chap. 281) Dialysis is indicated when medical management fails to control volume overload, hyperkalemia, acidosis, in some toxic ingestions, and when there are severe complications of uremia (asterixis, pericardial rub or effusion, encephalopathy, uremic bleeding). The timing of dialysis is still a matter of debate. Late initiation of dialysis carries the risk of avoidable volume, electrolyte, and metabolic complications of AKI. On the other hand, initiating dialysis too early may unnecessarily expose individuals to intravenous lines and invasive procedures, with the attendant risks of infection, bleeding, procedural complications, and hypotension. The initiation of dialysis should not await the development of a life-threatening complication of renal failure. Many nephrologists initiate dialysis for AKI empirically when the BUN exceeds 100 mg/dL in patients without clinical signs of recovery of kidney function.

The available modes for renal replacement therapy in AKI require either access to the peritoneal cavity (for peritoneal dialysis) or the large blood vessels (for hemodialysis, hemofiltration, and other hybrid procedures). Small solutes are removed across a semipermeable membrane down their concentration gradient ("diffusive" clearance) and/or along with the movement of plasma water ("convective" clearance). The choice of modality is often dictated by the immediate availability of technology and the expertise of medical staff. Peritoneal dialysis is performed through a temporary intraperitoneal catheter. It is rarely used in the United States for AKI in adults but has enjoyed widespread use internationally, particularly when hemodialysis technology is not available. Dialysate solution is instilled into and removed from the peritoneal cavity at regular intervals in order to achieve diffusive and convective clearance of solutes across the peritoneal membrane; ultrafiltration of water is achieved by the presence of an osmotic gradient across the peritoneal membrane, typically due to high concentrations of dextrose in the dialysate. Being a continuous procedure, it is often better tolerated than intermittent procedures like hemodialysis in hypotensive patients. Peritoneal dialysis may not be sufficient for hypercatabolic patients due to inherent limitations in dialysis efficacy.

Hemodialysis can be employed intermittently or continuously, and can be done through convective clearance, diffusive clearance, or a combination of the two. Vascular access is through the femoral, internal jugular, or subclavian veins. Hemodialysis is an intermittent procedure that removes solutes through diffusive and convective clearance. Hemodialysis is performed 3每4 h per d, three to four times per week, and is the most common form of renal replacement therapy for AKI. One of the major complications of hemodialysis is hypotension, particularly in the critically ill.

Continuous intravascular procedures were developed in the early 1980s to treat hemodynamically unstable patients without inducing the rapid shifts of volume, osmolarity, and electrolytes characteristic of intermittent hemodialysis. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) can be performed by convective clearance [continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH)], in which large volumes of plasma water (and accompanying solutes) are forced across the semipermeable membrane by means of hydrostatic pressure; the plasma water is then replaced by a physiologic crystalloid solution. CRRT can also be performed by diffusive clearance [continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD)], a technology similar to hemodialysis except at lower blood flow and dialysate flow rates. A hybrid therapy combines both diffusive and convective clearance [continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF)]. To achieve some of the advantages of CRRT without the need for 24-h staffing of the procedure, a newer form of therapy has been introduced, termed slow low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) or extended daily dialysis (EDD). In this therapy, blood flow and dialysate flow are higher than in CVVHD, but the treatment time is reduced to 12 h.

The optimal dose of dialysis for AKI is not clear. Daily intermittent hemodialysis and high-dose CRRT do not confer a demonstrable survival or renal recovery advantage, but care should be taken to avoid undertreatment. Studies have failed to show that continuous therapies are superior to intermittent therapies. If available, CRRT is often preferred in patients with severe hemodynamic instability, cerebral edema, or significant volume overload.
 
Outcome and Prognosis

The development of AKI is associated with a significantly increased risk of in-hospital and long-term mortality, longer length of stay, and increased costs. Prerenal azotemia, with the exception of the cardiorenal and hepatorenal syndromes, and postrenal azotemia carry a better prognosis than most cases of intrinsic AKI. The kidneys may recover even after severe, dialysis-requiring AKI. Survivors of an episode of AKI requiring temporary dialysis, however, are at extremely high risk for progressive CKD, and up to 10% may develop end-stage renal disease. Postdischarge care under the supervision of a nephrologist for aggressive secondary prevention of kidney disease is prudent. Patients with AKI are more likely to die prematurely after they leave the hospital even if their kidney function has recovered.

Chronic Kidney Disease: Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) encompasses a spectrum of different pathophysiologic processes associated with abnormal kidney function and a progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Table 280-1 provides a widely accepted classification, based on guidelines of the National Kidney Foundation [Kidney Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI)], in which stages of CKD are defined according to the estimated GFR.

The term chronic renal failure applies to the process of continuing significant irreversible reduction in nephron number and typically corresponds to CKD stages 3每5. The pathophysiologic processes and adaptations associated with chronic renal failure will be the focus of this chapter. The dispiriting term end-stage renal disease represents a stage of CKD where the accumulation of toxins, fluid, and electrolytes normally excreted by the kidneys results in the uremic syndrome. This syndrome leads to death unless the toxins are removed by renal replacement therapy, using dialysis or kidney transplantation. These latter interventions are discussed in Chaps. 281 and 282. End-stage renal disease will be supplanted in this chapter by the term stage 5 CKD.

Pathophysiology of Chronic Kidney Disease

The pathophysiology of CKD involves two broad sets of mechanisms of damage: (1) initiating mechanisms specific to the underlying etiology (e.g., genetically determined abnormalities in kidney development or integrity, immune complex deposition and inflammation in certain types of glomerulonephritis, or toxin exposure in certain diseases of the renal tubules and interstitium) and (2) a set of progressive mechanisms, involving hyperfiltration and hypertrophy of the remaining viable nephrons, that are a common consequence following long-term reduction of renal mass, irrespective of underlying etiology (Chap. 278). The responses to reduction in nephron number are mediated by vasoactive hormones, cytokines, and growth factors. Eventually, these short-term adaptations of hypertrophy and hyperfiltration become maladaptive as the increased pressure and flow predisposes to distortion of glomerular architecture, associated with sclerosis and dropout of the remaining nephrons (Fig. 280-1). Increased intrarenal activity of the renin-angiotensin axis appears to contribute both to the initial adaptive hyperfiltration and to the subsequent maladaptive hypertrophy and sclerosis, the latter, in part, owing to the stimulation of transforming growth factor  (TGF-). This process explains why a reduction in renal mass from an isolated insult may lead to a progressive decline in renal function over many years (Fig. 280-2).

Identification of Risk Factors and Staging of CKD

It is important to identify factors that increase the risk for CKD, even in individuals with normal GFR. Risk factors include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, autoimmune disease, older age, African ancestry, a family history of renal disease, a previous episode of acute kidney injury, and the presence of proteinuria, abnormal urinary sediment, or structural abnormalities of the urinary tract.

Recent research in the genetics of predisposition to common complex diseases (Chap. 61) has revealed DNA sequence variants at a number of genetic loci that are associated with common forms of CKD. A striking example is the finding of allelic versions of the APOL1 gene, of West African population ancestry, which contributes to the several-fold higher frequency of certain common etiologies of CKD (e.g., focal segmental glomerulosclerosis) observed among African and Hispanic Americans. The prevalence in West African populations seems to have an evolutionary basis, since these same variants offer protection from tropical pathogens.

In order to stage CKD, it is necessary to estimate the GFR. Two equations commonly used to estimate GFR are shown in Table 280-2 and incorporate the measured plasma creatinine concentration, age, sex, and ethnic origin. Many laboratories now report an estimated GFR, or "eGFR," using one of these equations.

The normal annual mean decline in GFR with age from the peak GFR (120 mL/min per 1.73 m2) attained during the third decade of life is 1 mL/min per year per 1.73 m2, reaching a mean value of 70 mL/min per 1.73 m2 at age 70. The mean GFR is lower in women than in men. For example, a woman in her 80s with a normal serum creatinine may have a GFR of just 50 mL/min per 1.73 m2. Thus, even a mild elevation in serum creatinine concentration [e.g., 130 mol/L (1.5 mg/dL)] often signifies a substantial reduction in GFR in most individuals.

Measurement of albuminuria is also helpful for monitoring nephron injury and the response to therapy in many forms of CKD, especially chronic glomerular diseases. While an accurate 24-h urine collection is the criterion standard for measurement of albuminuria, the measurement of protein-to-creatinine ratio in a spot first-morning urine sample is often more practical to obtain and correlates well, but not perfectly, with 24-h urine collections. Persistence in the urine of >17 mg of albumin per gram of creatinine in adult males and 25 mg albumin per gram of creatinine in adult females usually signifies chronic renal damage. Microalbuminuria refers to the excretion of amounts of albumin too small to detect by urinary dipstick or conventional measures of urine protein. It is a good screening test for early detection of renal disease, and may be a marker for the presence of microvascular disease in general. If a patient has a large amount of excreted albumin, there is no reason to test for microalbuminuria.

Stages 1 and 2 CKD are usually not associated with any symptoms arising from the decrement in GFR. However, there may be symptoms from the underlying renal disease itself, such as edema in patients with nephrotic syndrome or signs of hypertension secondary to the renal parenchymal disease in patients with polycystic kidney disease, some forms of glomerulonephritis, and many other parenchymal and vascular renal diseases, even with well-preserved GFR. If the decline in GFR progresses to stages 3 and 4, clinical and laboratory complications of CKD become more prominent. Virtually all organ systems are affected, but the most evident complications include anemia and associated easy fatigability; decreasing appetite with progressive malnutrition; abnormalities in calcium, phosphorus, and mineral-regulating hormones, such as 1,25(OH)2D3 (calcitriol), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23); and abnormalities in sodium, potassium, water, and acid-base homeostasis. Many patients, especially the elderly, will have eGFR values compatible with stage 2 or 3 CKD. However, the majority of these patients will show no further deterioration of renal function. The primary care physician is advised to recheck kidney function, and if it is stable and not associated with proteinuria, the patient can usually be managed in this setting. However, if there is evidence of decline of GFR and uncontrolled hypertension or proteinuria, referral to a nephrologist is appropriate. If the patient progresses to stage 5 CKD, toxins accumulate such that patients usually experience a marked disturbance in their activities of daily living, well-being, nutritional status, and water and electrolyte homeostasis, eventuating in the uremic syndrome. As noted, this state will culminate in death unless renal replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation) is instituted.

Etiology and Epidemiology

It has been estimated from population survey data that at least 6% of the adult population in the United States has CKD at stages 1 and 2. An unknown subset of this group will progress to more advanced stages of CKD. An additional 4.5% of the U.S. population is estimated to have stages 3 and 4 CKD. Table 280-3 lists the five most frequent categories of causes of CKD, cumulatively accounting for greater than 90% of the CKD disease burden worldwide. The relative contribution of each category varies among different geographic regions. The most frequent cause of CKD in North America and Europe is diabetic nephropathy, most often secondary to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients with newly diagnosed CKD often also present with hypertension. When no overt evidence for a primary glomerular or tubulointerstitial kidney disease process is present, CKD is often attributed to hypertension. However, it is now appreciated that such individuals can be considered in two categories. The first includes patients with a silent primary glomerulopathy, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, without the overt nephrotic or nephritic manifestations of glomerular disease (Chap. 283). The second includes patients in whom progressive nephrosclerosis and hypertension is the renal correlate of a systemic vascular disease, often also involving large- and small-vessel cardiac and cerebral pathology. This latter combination is especially common in the elderly, in whom chronic renal ischemia as a cause of CKD may be underdiagnosed. The increasing incidence of CKD in the elderly has been ascribed, in part, to decreased mortality rate from the cardiac and cerebral complications of atherosclerotic vascular disease, enabling a greater segment of the population to manifest the renal component of generalized vascular disease. Nevertheless, it should be appreciated that the vast majority of such patients with early stages of CKD will succumb to the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular consequences of the vascular disease before they can progress to the most advanced stages of CKD. Indeed, even a minor decrement in GFR or the presence of albuminuria is now recognized as a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

Pathophysiology and Biochemistry of Uremia

Although serum urea and creatinine concentrations are used to measure the excretory capacity of the kidneys, accumulation of these two molecules themselves do not account for the many symptoms and signs that characterize the uremic syndrome in advanced renal failure. Hundreds of toxins that accumulate in renal failure have been implicated in the uremic syndrome. These include water-soluble, hydrophobic, protein-bound, charged, and uncharged compounds. Additional categories of nitrogenous excretory products include guanidino compounds, urates and hippurates, products of nucleic acid metabolism, polyamines, myoinositol, phenols, benzoates, and indoles. Compounds with a molecular mass between 500 and 1500 Da, the so-called middle molecules, are also retained and contribute to morbidity and mortality. It is thus evident that the serum concentrations of urea and creatinine should be viewed as being readily measured, but incomplete, surrogate markers for these compounds, and monitoring the levels of urea and creatinine in the patient with impaired kidney function represents a vast oversimplification of the uremic state.

The uremic syndrome and the disease state associated with advanced renal impairment involve more than renal excretory failure. A host of metabolic and endocrine functions normally performed by the kidneys is also impaired or suppressed, and this results in anemia, malnutrition, and abnormal metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Furthermore, plasma levels of many hormones, including PTH, FGF-23, insulin, glucagon, steroid hormones including vitamin D and sex hormones, and prolactin, change with renal failure as a result of urinary retention, decreased degradation, or abnormal regulation. Finally, progressive renal impairment is associated with worsening systemic inflammation. Elevated levels of C-reactive protein are detected along with other acute-phase reactants, while levels of so-called negative acute-phase reactants, such as albumin and fetuin, decline with progressive renal impairment, even in nonproteinuric kidney disease. Thus, the inflammation associated with renal impairment is important in the malnutrition-inflammation-atherosclerosis/calcification syndrome, which contributes in turn to the acceleration of vascular disease and comorbidity rate associated with advanced kidney disease.

In summary, the pathophysiology of the uremic syndrome can be divided into manifestations in three spheres of dysfunction: (1) those consequent to the accumulation of toxins that normally undergo renal excretion, including products of protein metabolism; (2) those consequent to the loss of other renal functions, such as fluid and electrolyte homeostasis and hormone regulation; and (3) progressive systemic inflammation and its vascular and nutritional consequences.
 
Clinical and Laboratory Manifestations of Chronic Kidney Disease and Uremia

Uremia leads to disturbances in the function of virtually every organ system. Chronic dialysis can reduce the incidence and severity of many of these disturbances, so that the overt and florid manifestations of uremia have largely disappeared in the modern health setting. However, as indicated in Table 280-4, even optimal dialysis therapy is not completely effective as renal replacement therapy, because some disturbances resulting from impaired renal function fail to respond to dialysis.

Fluid, Electrolyte, and Acid-Base Disorders

Sodium and Water Homeostasis

In most patients with stable CKD, the total-body content of sodium and water is modestly increased, although this may not be apparent on clinical examination. Normal renal function guarantees that the tubular reabsorption of filtered sodium and water is adjusted so that urinary excretion matches intake. Many forms of renal disease (e.g., glomerulonephritis) disrupt this glomerulotubular balance such that dietary intake of sodium exceeds its urinary excretion, leading to sodium retention and attendant extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) expansion. This expansion may contribute to hypertension, which itself can accelerate the nephron injury. As long as water intake does not exceed the capacity for water clearance, the ECFV expansion will be isotonic and the patient will have a normal plasma sodium concentration and effective osmolality (Chap. 278). Hyponatremia is not commonly seen in CKD patients but, when present, can respond to water restriction. If the patient has evidence of ECFV expansion (peripheral edema, sometimes hypertension poorly responsive to therapy), he or she should be counseled regarding salt restriction. Thiazide diuretics have limited utility in stages 3每5 CKD, such that administration of loop diuretics, including furosemide, bumetanide, or torsemide, may also be needed. Resistance to loop diuretics in renal failure often mandates use of higher doses than those used in patients with near-normal kidney function. The combination of loop diuretics with metolazone, which inhibits the sodium chloride co-transporter of the distal convoluted tubule, can help effect renal salt excretion. Ongoing diuretic resistance with intractable edema and hypertension in advanced CKD may serve as an indication to initiate dialysis.

In addition to problems with salt and water excretion, some patients with CKD may instead have impaired renal conservation of sodium and water. When an extrarenal cause for fluid loss, such as gastrointestinal (GI) loss, is present, these patients may be prone to ECFV depletion because of the inability of the failing kidney to reclaim filtered sodium adequately. Furthermore, depletion of ECFV, whether due to GI losses or overzealous diuretic therapy, can further compromise kidney function through underperfusion, or a "prerenal" basis, leading to acute-on-chronic kidney failure. In this setting, cautious volume repletion with normal saline may return the ECFV to normal and restore renal function to baseline without having to intervene with dialysis.

Potassium Homeostasis

In CKD, the decline in GFR is not necessarily accompanied by a parallel decline in urinary potassium excretion, which is predominantly mediated by aldosterone-dependent secretory events in distal nephron segments. Another defense against potassium retention in these patients is augmented potassium excretion in the GI tract. Notwithstanding these two homeostatic responses, hyperkalemia may be precipitated in certain settings. These include increased dietary potassium intake, protein catabolism, hemolysis, hemorrhage, transfusion of stored red blood cells, and metabolic acidosis. In addition, a host of medications can inhibit renal potassium excretion. The most important medications in this respect include the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and spironolactone and other potassium-sparing diuretics such as amiloride, eplerenone, and triamterene.

Certain causes of CKD can be associated with earlier and more severe disruption of potassium-secretory mechanisms in the distal nephron, out of proportion to the decline in GFR. These include conditions associated with hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, such as diabetes, and renal diseases that preferentially affect the distal nephron, such as obstructive uropathy and sickle cell nephropathy.

Hypokalemia is not common in CKD and usually reflects markedly reduced dietary potassium intake, especially in association with excessive diuretic therapy or concurrent GI losses. Hypokalemia can also occur as a result of primary renal potassium wasting in association with other solute transport abnormalities, such as Fanconi's syndrome, renal tubular acidosis, or other forms of hereditary or acquired tubulointerstitial disease. However, even with these conditions, as the GFR declines, the tendency to hypokalemia diminishes and hyperkalemia may supervene. Therefore, the use of potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics should be constantly reevaluated as GFR declines.

Metabolic Acidosis

Metabolic acidosis is a common disturbance in advanced CKD. The majority of patients can still acidify the urine, but they produce less ammonia and, therefore, cannot excrete the normal quantity of protons in combination with this urinary buffer. Hyperkalemia, if present, further depresses ammonia production. The combination of hyperkalemia and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis is often present, even at earlier stages of CKD (stages 1每3), in patients with diabetic nephropathy or in those with predominant tubulointerstitial disease or obstructive uropathy; this is a non-anion-gap metabolic acidosis. Treatment of hyperkalemia may increase renal ammonia production, improve renal generation of bicarbonate, and improve the metabolic acidosis.

With worsening renal function, the total urinary net daily acid excretion is usually limited to 30每40 mmol, and the anions of retained organic acids can then lead to an anion-gap metabolic acidosis. Thus, the non-anion-gap metabolic acidosis that can be seen in earlier stages of CKD may be complicated by the addition of an anion-gap metabolic acidosis as CKD progresses. In most patients, the metabolic acidosis is mild; the pH is rarely <7.35 and can usually be corrected with oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation. Animal and human studies have suggested that even modest degrees of metabolic acidosis may be associated with the development of protein catabolism. Alkali supplementation may attenuate the catabolic state and possibly slow CKD progression and accordingly is recommended when the serum bicarbonate concentration falls below 20每23 mmol/L. The concomitant sodium load mandates careful attention to volume status and the potential need for diuretic agents.

Treatment: Fluid, Electrolyte, and Acid-Base Disorders

Adjustments in the dietary intake of salt and use of loop diuretics, occasionally in combination with metolazone, may be needed to maintain euvolemia. In contrast, overzealous salt restriction or diuretic use can lead to ECFV depletion and precipitate a further decline in GFR. The rare patient with salt-losing nephropathy may require a sodium-rich diet or salt supplementation. Water restriction is indicated only if there is a problem with hyponatremia. Otherwise, patients with CKD and an intact thirst mechanism may be instructed to drink fluids in a quantity that keeps them just ahead of their thirst. Intractable ECFV expansion, despite dietary salt restriction and diuretic therapy, may be an indication to start renal replacement therapy. Hyperkalemia often responds to dietary restriction of potassium, avoidance of potassium supplements (including occult sources, such as dietary salt substitutes) as well as potassium-retaining medications (especially ACE inhibitors or ARBs), or the use of kaliuretic diuretics. Kaliuretic diuretics promote urinary potassium excretion, while potassium-binding resins, such as calcium resonium or sodium polystyrene, can promote potassium loss through the GI tract and may reduce the incidence of hyperkalemia in CKD patients. Intractable hyperkalemia is an indication (although uncommon) to consider institution of dialysis in a CKD patient. The renal tubular acidosis and subsequent anion-gap metabolic acidosis in progressive CKD will respond to alkali supplementation, typically with sodium bicarbonate. Recent studies suggest that this replacement should be considered when the serum bicarbonate concentration falls below 20每23 mmol/L to avoid the protein catabolic state seen with even mild degrees of metabolic acidosis and to slow the progression of CKD.

Disorders of Calcium and Phosphate Metabolism

The principal complications of abnormalities of calcium and phosphate metabolism in CKD occur in the skeleton and the vascular bed, with occasional severe involvement of extraosseous soft tissues. It is likely that disorders of bone turnover and disorders of vascular and soft tissue calcification are related to each other (Fig. 280-2).

Figure 280-2

Bone Manifestations of CKD

The major disorders of bone disease can be classified into those associated with high bone turnover with increased PTH levels (including osteitis fibrosa cystica, the classic lesion of secondary hyperparathyroidism) and low bone turnover with low or normal PTH levels (adynamic bone disease and osteomalacia).

The pathophysiology of secondary hyperparathyroidism and the consequent high-turnover bone disease is related to abnormal mineral metabolism through the following events: (1) declining GFR leads to reduced excretion of phosphate and, thus, phosphate retention; (2) the retained phosphate stimulates increased synthesis of PTH and growth of parathyroid gland mass; and (3) decreased levels of ionized calcium, resulting from diminished calcitriol production by the failing kidney as well as phosphate retention, also stimulate PTH production. Low calcitriol levels contribute to hyperparathyroidism, both by leading to hypocalcemia and also by a direct effect on PTH gene transcription. These changes start to occur when the GFR falls below 60 mL/min.

Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) is part of a family of phosphatonins that promotes renal phosphate excretion. Recent studies have shown that levels of this hormone, secreted by osteocytes, increases early in the course of CKD. It may defend normal serum phosphorus in at least three ways: (1) increased renal phosphate excretion; (2) stimulation of PTH, which also increases renal phosphate excretion; and (3) suppression of the formation of 1,25(OH)2D3, leading to diminished phosphorus absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Interestingly, high levels of FGF-23 are also an independent risk factor for left ventricular hypertrophy and mortality in dialysis patients. Moreover, elevated levels of FGF-23 may indicate the need for therapeutic intervention (e.g., phosphate restriction), even when serum phosphate levels are within the normal range.

Hyperparathyroidism stimulates bone turnover and leads to osteitis fibrosa cystica. Bone histology shows abnormal osteoid, bone and bone marrow fibrosis, and in advanced stages, the formation of bone cysts, sometimes with hemorrhagic elements so that they appear brown in color, hence the term brown tumor. Clinical manifestations of severe hyperparathyroidism include bone pain and fragility, brown tumors, compression syndromes, tumors, and erythropoietin resistance in part related to the bone marrow fibrosis. Furthermore, PTH itself is considered a uremic toxin, and high levels are associated with muscle weakness, fibrosis of cardiac muscle, and nonspecific constitutional symptoms.

Low-turnover bone disease can be grouped into two categories〞adynamic bone disease and osteomalacia. In the latter condition, there is accumulation of unmineralized bone matrix that may be caused by a number of processes, including vitamin D deficiency, metabolic acidosis, and in the past aluminum deposition. Adynamic bone disease is increasing in prevalence, especially among diabetics and the elderly. It is characterized by reduced bone volume and mineralization and may result from excessive suppression of PTH production, chronic inflammation, or both. Suppression of PTH can result from the use of vitamin D preparations or from excessive calcium exposure in the form of calcium-containing phosphate binders or high-calcium dialysis solutions. Complications of adynamic bone disease include an increased incidence of fracture and bone pain and an association with increased vascular and cardiac calcification.

Calcium, Phosphorus, and the Cardiovascular System

Recent epidemiologic evidence has shown a strong association between hyperphosphatemia and increased cardiovascular mortality rate in patients with stage 5 CKD and even in patients with earlier stages of CKD. Hyperphosphatemia and hypercalcemia are associated with increased vascular calcification, but it is unclear whether the excessive mortality rate is mediated by this mechanism. Studies using CT and electron-beam CT scanning show that CKD patients have calcification of the media in coronary arteries and even heart valves that appear to be orders of magnitude greater than that in patients without renal disease. The magnitude of the calcification is proportional to age and hyperphosphatemia and is also associated with low PTH levels and low bone turnover. It is possible that in patients with advanced kidney disease, ingested calcium cannot be deposited in bones with low turnover and, therefore, is deposited at extraosseous sites, such as the vascular bed and soft tissues. It is interesting in this regard that there is also an association between osteoporosis and vascular calcification in the general population. Finally, there is recent evidence indicating that hyperphosphatemia can induce a change in gene expression in vascular cells to an osteoblast-like profile, leading to vascular calcification and even ossification.

Other Complications of Abnormal Mineral Metabolism

Calciphylaxis (calcific uremic arteriolopathy) is a devastating condition seen almost exclusively in patients with advanced CKD. It is heralded by livedo reticularis and advances to patches of ischemic necrosis, especially on the legs, thighs, abdomen, and breasts (Fig. 280-3). Pathologically, there is evidence of vascular occlusion in association with extensive vascular and soft tissue calcification. It appears that this condition is increasing in incidence. Originally it was ascribed to severe abnormalities in calcium and phosphorus control in dialysis patients, usually associated with advanced hyperparathyroidism. However, more recently, calciphylaxis has been seen with increasing frequency in the absence of severe hyperparathyroidism. Other etiologies have been suggested, including the increased use of oral calcium as a phosphate binder. Warfarin is commonly used in hemodialysis patients, and one of the effects of warfarin therapy is to decrease the vitamin K每dependent regeneration of matrix GLA protein. This latter protein is important in preventing vascular calcification. Thus, warfarin treatment is considered a risk factor for calciphylaxis, and if a patient develops this syndrome, this medication should be discontinued and replaced with alternative forms of anticoagulation.

She slept with the dialysis catheter pressed between her legs. A small abrasion was followed by progressive skin necrosis along the catheter tract on her inner thighs. Despite treatment with hyperbaric oxygen, intravenous thiosulfate, and discontinuation of warfarin, she succumbed to systemic complications of the necrotic process.
 
 

Treatment: Disorders of Calcium and Phosphate Metabolism

The optimal management of secondary hyperparathyroidism and osteitis fibrosa is prevention. Once the parathyroid gland mass is very large, it is difficult to control the disease. Careful attention should be paid to the plasma phosphate concentration in CKD patients, who should be counseled on a low-phosphate diet as well as the appropriate use of phosphate-binding agents. These are agents that are taken with meals and complex the dietary phosphate to limit its GI absorption. Examples of phosphate binders are calcium acetate and calcium carbonate. A major side effect of calcium-based phosphate binders is total-body calcium accumulation and hypercalcemia, especially in patients with low-turnover bone disease. Sevelamer and lanthanum are non-calcium-containing polymers that also function as phosphate binders; they do not predispose CKD patients to hypercalcemia and may attenuate calcium deposition in the vascular bed.

Calcitriol exerts a direct suppressive effect on PTH secretion and also indirectly suppresses PTH secretion by raising the concentration of ionized calcium. However, calcitriol therapy may result in hypercalcemia and/or hyperphosphatemia through increased GI absorption of these minerals. Certain analogues of calcitriol are available (e.g., paricalcitol) that suppress PTH secretion with less attendant hypercalcemia.

Recognition of the role of the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor has led to the development of calcimimetic agents that enhance the sensitivity of the parathyroid cell to the suppressive effect of calcium. This class of drug, which includes cinacalcet, produces a dose-dependent reduction in PTH and plasma calcium concentration in some patients.

Current KDOQI guidelines recommend a target PTH level between 150 and 300 pg/mL, recognizing that very low PTH levels are associated with adynamic bone disease and possible consequences of fracture and ectopic calcification.

Cardiovascular Abnormalities

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients at every stage of CKD. The incremental risk of cardiovascular disease in those with CKD compared to the age- and sex-matched general population ranges from 10- to 200-fold, depending on the stage of CKD. Between 30 and 45% of patients reaching stage 5 CKD already have advanced cardiovascular complications. As a result, most patients with CKD succumb to cardiovascular disease (Fig. 280-4) before ever reaching stage 5 CKD. Thus, the focus of patient care in earlier CKD stages should be directed to prevention of cardiovascular complications.

Ischemic Vascular Disease

The presence of any stage of CKD is a major risk factor for ischemic cardiovascular disease, including occlusive coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular disease. The increased prevalence of vascular disease in CKD patients derives from both traditional ("classic") and nontraditional (CKD-related) risk factors. Traditional risk factors include hypertension, hypervolemia, dyslipidemia, sympathetic overactivity, and hyperhomocysteinemia. The CKD-related risk factors comprise anemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, sleep apnea, and generalized inflammation. The inflammatory state associated with a reduction in kidney function is reflected in increased circulating acute-phase reactants, such as inflammatory cytokines and C-reactive protein, with a corresponding fall in the "negative acute-phase reactants," such as serum albumin and fetuin. The inflammatory state appears to accelerate vascular occlusive disease, and low levels of fetuin may permit more rapid vascular calcification, especially in the face of hyperphosphatemia. Other abnormalities seen in CKD may augment myocardial ischemia, including left ventricular hypertrophy and microvascular disease. Coronary reserve, defined as the increase in coronary blood flow in response to greater demand, is also attenuated. There is diminished availability of nitric oxide because of increased concentration of asymmetric dimethyl-1-arginine and increased scavenging by reactive oxygen species. In addition, hemodialysis, with its attendant episodes of hypotension and hypovolemia, may further aggravate coronary ischemia. Interestingly, however, the largest increment in cardiovascular mortality rate in dialysis patients is not necessarily directly associated with documented acute myocardial infarction but, instead, presents with congestive heart failure and all of its manifestations, including sudden death.

Cardiac troponin levels are frequently elevated in CKD without evidence of acute ischemia. The elevation complicates the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in this population. Serial measurements may be needed, and if the level is unchanged, it is possible that there is no acute myocardial ischemia. On the other hand, an increase upon subsequent testing suggests cardiac injury. Therefore, the trend in levels over the hours after presentation may be more informative than a single, elevated level. Interestingly, consistently elevated levels are an independent prognostic factor for adverse cardiovascular events in this population.

Heart Failure

Abnormal cardiac function secondary to myocardial ischemia, left ventricular hypertrophy, and frank cardiomyopathy, in combination with the salt and water retention that can be seen with CKD, often results in heart failure or even episodes of pulmonary edema. Heart failure can be a consequence of diastolic or systolic dysfunction, or both. A form of "low-pressure" pulmonary edema can also occur in advanced CKD, manifesting as shortness of breath and a "bat wing" distribution of alveolar edema fluid on the chest x-ray. This finding can occur even in the absence of ECFV overload and is associated with normal or mildly elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. This process has been ascribed to increased permeability of alveolar capillary membranes as a manifestation of the uremic state, and it responds to dialysis. Other CKD-related risk factors, including anemia and sleep apnea, may contribute to the risk of heart failure.

Hypertension and Left Ventricular Hypertrophy

Hypertension is one of the most common complications of CKD. It usually develops early during the course of CKD and is associated with adverse outcomes, including the development of ventricular hypertrophy and a more rapid loss of renal function. Many studies have shown a relationship between the level of blood pressure and the rate of progression of diabetic and non-diabetic kidney disease. Left ventricular hypertrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy are among the strongest risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD and are thought to be related primarily, but not exclusively, to prolonged hypertension and ECFV overload. In addition, anemia and the placement of an arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis can generate a high cardiac output state and consequent heart failure.

The absence of hypertension may signify the presence of a salt-wasting form of renal disease, the effect of antihypertensive therapy, or volume depletion or may signify poor left ventricular function. Indeed, in epidemiologic studies of dialysis patients, low blood pressure actually carries a worse prognosis than does high blood pressure. This mechanism, in part, accounts for the "reverse causation" seen in dialysis patients, wherein the presence of traditional risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity, appear to portend a better prognosis. Importantly, these observations derive from cross-sectional studies of late-stage CKD patients and should not be interpreted to discourage appropriate management of these risk factors in CKD patients, especially at early stages. In contrast to the general population, it is possible that in late-stage CKD, low blood pressure, reduced body mass index, and hypolipidemia indicate the presence of an advanced malnutrition-inflammation state, with poor prognosis.

The use of exogenous erythropoiesis-stimulating agents can increase blood pressure and the requirement for antihypertensive drugs. Chronic ECFV overload is also a contributor to hypertension, and improvement in blood pressure can often be seen with the use of dietary sodium restriction, diuretics, and fluid removal with dialysis. Nevertheless, because of activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and other disturbances in the balance of vasoconstrictors and vasodilators, some patients remain hypertensive despite careful attention to ECFV status.

Treatment: Cardiovascular Abnormalities

Management of Hypertension

There are two overall goals of therapy for hypertension in these patients: to slow the progression of the kidney disease itself, and to prevent the extrarenal complications of high blood pressure, such as cardiovascular disease and stroke. In all patients with CKD, blood pressure should be controlled to levels recommended by national guideline panels. In CKD patients with diabetes or proteinuria >1 g per 24 h, blood pressure should be reduced to 125/75, if achievable without prohibitive adverse effects. Salt restriction should be the first line of therapy. When volume management alone is not sufficient, the choice of antihypertensive agent is similar to that in the general population. The ACE inhibitors and ARBs slow the rate of decline of kidney function, but occasionally can precipitate an episode of acute kidney injury, especially when used in patients with ischemic renovascular disease. The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs may also be complicated by the development of hyperkalemia. Often the concomitant use of a kaliuretic diuretic, such as metolazone, can improve potassium excretion in addition to improving blood pressure control. Potassium-sparing diuretics should be used with caution or avoided altogether in most patients. Indeed, increased usage of spironolactone for the management of heart failure has resulted in an increase in serious hyperkalemic events in patients with reduced kidney function.

Management of Cardiovascular Disease

There are many strategies available to treat the traditional and nontraditional risk factors in CKD patients. While these have been proved effective in the general population, there is little evidence for their benefit in patients with advanced CKD, especially those on dialysis. Certainly hypertension, elevated serum levels of homocysteine, and dyslipidemia promote atherosclerotic disease and are treatable complications of CKD. Renal disease complicated by nephrotic syndrome is associated with a very atherogenic lipid profile and hypercoagulability, which increases the risk of occlusive vascular disease. Since diabetes mellitus and hypertension are the two most frequent causes of advanced CKD, it is not surprising that cardiovascular disease is the most frequent cause of death in dialysis patients. The role of "inflammation" may be quantitatively more important in patients with kidney disease, and the treatment of more traditional risk factors may result in only modest success. However, modulation of traditional risk factors may be the only weapon in the therapeutic armamentarium for these patients until the nature of inflammation in CKD and its treatment are better understood.

Lifestyle changes, including regular exercise, should be advocated but are not often implemented. Hyperlipidemia in patients with CKD should be managed according to national guidelines. If dietary measures are not sufficient, preferred lipid-lowering medications, such as statins, should be used. Again, the use of these agents has not been of proven benefit for patients with advanced CKD.

Pericardial Disease

Chest pain with respiratory accentuation, accompanied by a friction rub, is diagnostic of pericarditis. Classic electrocardiographic abnormalities include PR-interval depression and diffuse ST-segment elevation. Pericarditis can be accompanied by pericardial effusion that is seen on echocardiography and can rarely lead to tamponade. However, the pericardial effusion can be asymptomatic, and pericarditis can be seen without significant effusion.

Pericarditis is observed in advanced uremia, and with the advent of timely initiation of dialysis, is not as common as it once was. It is now more often observed in underdialyzed, nonadherent patients than in those starting dialysis.

Treatment: Pericardial Disease

Uremic pericarditis is an absolute indication for the urgent initiation of dialysis or for intensification of the dialysis prescription in those already receiving dialysis. Because of the propensity to hemorrhage in pericardial fluid, hemodialysis should be performed without heparin. A pericardial drainage procedure should be considered in patients with recurrent pericardial effusion, especially with echocardiographic signs of impending tamponade. Nonuremic causes of pericarditis and effusion include viral, malignant, tuberculous, and autoimmune etiologies. It may also be seen after myocardial infarction and as a complication of treatment with the antihypertensive drug minoxidil.

Hematologic Abnormalities

Anemia

A normocytic, normochromic anemia is observed as early as stage 3 CKD and is almost universal by stage 4. The primary cause in patients with CKD is insufficient production of erythropoietin (EPO) by the diseased kidneys. Additional factors include iron deficiency, acute and chronic inflammation with impaired iron utilization ("anemia of chronic disease"), severe hyperparathyroidism with consequent bone marrow fibrosis, and shortened red cell survival in the uremic environment. In addition, comorbid conditions such as hemoglobinopathy can worsen the anemia (Table 280-5).

The anemia of CKD is associated with a number of adverse pathophysiologic consequences, including decreased tissue oxygen delivery and utilization, increased cardiac output, ventricular dilation, and ventricular hypertrophy. Clinical manifestations include fatigue and diminished exercise tolerance, angina, heart failure, decreased cognition and mental acuity, and impaired host defense against infection. In addition, anemia may play a role in growth retardation in children with CKD. While many studies in CKD patients have found that anemia and resistance to exogenous EPO are associated with a poor prognosis, the relative contribution to a poor outcome of the low hematocrit itself, versus inflammation as a cause of the anemia, remains unclear.

Treatment: Anemia

The availability of recombinant human EPO and modified EPO products, such as darbepoetin-alpha, has been one of the most significant advances in the care of renal patients since the introduction of dialysis and renal transplantation. The routine use of these products has obviated the need for regular blood transfusions in severely anemic CKD patients, thus dramatically reducing the incidence of transfusion-associated infections and iron overload. Frequent blood transfusions in dialysis patients also leads to the development of allo-antibodies that could sensitize the patient to donor kidney antigens and make renal transplantation more problematic.

Adequate bone marrow iron stores should be available before treatment with EPO is initiated. Iron supplementation is usually essential to ensure an optimal response to EPO in patients with CKD because the demand for iron by the marrow frequently exceeds the amount of iron that is immediately available for erythropoiesis (measured by percent transferrin saturation), as well as the amount in iron stores (measured by serum ferritin). For the CKD patient not yet on dialysis or the patient treated with peritoneal dialysis, oral iron supplementation should be attempted. If there is GI intolerance, the patient may have to undergo IV iron infusion. For patients on hemodialysis, IV iron can be administered during dialysis. In addition to iron, an adequate supply of other major substrates and cofactors for red cell production must be ensured, including vitamin B12 and folate. Anemia resistant to recommended doses of EPO in the face of adequate iron stores may be due to some combination of the following: acute or chronic inflammation, inadequate dialysis, severe hyperparathyroidism, chronic blood loss or hemolysis, chronic infection, or malignancy. Patients with a hemoglobinopathy, such as sickle cell disease or thalassemia, will usually not respond normally to exogenous EPO; however, an increase in hemoglobin concentration is still seen in many of these patients. Blood transfusions increase the risk of hepatitis, iron overload, and transplant sensitization; they should be avoided unless the anemia fails to respond to EPO and the patient is symptomatic.

At least three randomized, controlled trials of erythropoietin-stimulating agents in CKD have failed to show an improvement in cardiovascular outcomes with this therapy. Indeed, there has been an indication that the use of EPO in CKD may be associated with an increased risk of stroke in those with type 2 diabetes, an increase in thromboembolic events, and perhaps a faster progression to the need for dialysis. Therefore, any benefit in terms of improvement of anemic symptoms needs to be balanced against the potential cardiovascular risk of EPO therapy in CKD. While further studies are needed, it is quite clear that complete normalization of the hemoglobin concentration has not been demonstrated to be of incremental benefit to CKD patients. Current practice is to target a hemoglobin concentration of 100每115 g/L.

Abnormal Hemostasis

Patients with later stages of CKD may have a prolonged bleeding time, decreased activity of platelet factor III, abnormal platelet aggregation and adhesiveness, and impaired prothrombin consumption. Clinical manifestations include an increased tendency to bleeding and bruising, prolonged bleeding from surgical incisions, menorrhagia, and spontaneous GI bleeding. Interestingly, CKD patients also have a greater susceptibility to thromboembolism, especially if they have renal disease that includes nephrotic-range proteinuria. The latter condition results in hypoalbuminemia and renal loss of anticoagulant factors, which can lead to a thrombophilic state.

Treatment: Abnormal Hemostasis

Abnormal bleeding time and coagulopathy in patients with renal failure may be reversed temporarily with desmopressin (DDAVP), cryoprecipitate, IV conjugated estrogens, blood transfusions, and EPO therapy. Optimal dialysis will usually correct a prolonged bleeding time.

Given the coexistence of bleeding disorders and a propensity to thrombosis that is unique in the CKD patient, decisions about anticoagulation that have a favorable risk-benefit profile in the general population may not be applicable to the patient with advanced CKD. One example is warfarin anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation: the decision to anticoagulate should be made on an individual basis in the CKD patient, as there appears to be a greater risk of bleeding complications.

Certain anticoagulants, such as fractionated low-molecular-weight heparin, may need to be avoided or dose adjusted in these patients, with monitoring of factor Xa activity where available. It is often more prudent to use conventional high-molecular-weight heparin, titrated to the measured partial thromboplastin time, in hospitalized patients requiring an alternative to warfarin anticoagulation.

Neuromuscular Abnormalities

Central nervous system (CNS), peripheral, and autonomic neuropathy as well as abnormalities in muscle structure and function are all well-recognized complications of CKD. Retained nitrogenous metabolites and middle molecules, including PTH, contribute to the pathophysiology of neuromuscular abnormalities. Subtle clinical manifestations of uremic neuromuscular disease usually become evident at stage 3 CKD. Early manifestations of CNS complications include mild disturbances in memory and concentration and sleep disturbance. Neuromuscular irritability, including hiccups, cramps, and fasciculations or twitching of muscles, becomes evident at later stages. In advanced untreated kidney failure, asterixis, myoclonus, seizures, and coma can be seen.

Peripheral neuropathy usually becomes clinically evident after the patient reaches stage 4 CKD, although electrophysiologic and histologic evidence occurs earlier. Initially, sensory nerves are involved more than motor, lower extremities more than upper, and distal parts of the extremities more than proximal. The "restless leg syndrome" is characterized by ill-defined sensations of sometimes debilitating discomfort in the legs and feet relieved by frequent leg movement. If dialysis is not instituted soon after onset of sensory abnormalities, motor involvement follows, including muscle weakness. Evidence of peripheral neuropathy without another cause (e.g., diabetes mellitus) is a firm indication for starting renal replacement therapy. Many of the complications described above will resolve with dialysis, although subtle nonspecific abnormalities may persist. Successful renal transplantation may reverse residual neurologic changes.

Gastrointestinal and Nutritional Abnormalities

Uremic fetor, a urine-like odor on the breath, derives from the breakdown of urea to ammonia in saliva and is often associated with an unpleasant metallic taste (dysgeusia). Gastritis, peptic disease, and mucosal ulcerations at any level of the GI tract occur in uremic patients and can lead to abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and GI bleeding. These patients are also prone to constipation, which can be worsened by the administration of calcium and iron supplements. The retention of uremic toxins also leads to anorexia, nausea, and vomiting.

Protein restriction may be useful to decrease nausea and vomiting; however, it may put the patient at risk for malnutrition and should be carried out, if possible, in consultation with a registered dietitian specializing in the management of CKD patients. Protein-energy malnutrition, a consequence of low protein and caloric intake, is common in advanced CKD and is often an indication for initiation of renal replacement therapy. In addition to diminished intake, these patients are resistant to the anabolic actions of insulin and other hormones and growth factors. Metabolic acidosis and the activation of inflammatory cytokines can promote protein catabolism. Assessment for protein-energy malnutrition should begin at stage 3 CKD. A number of indices are useful in this assessment and include dietary history, including food diary and subjective global assessment; edema-free body weight; and measurement of urinary protein nitrogen appearance. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry is now widely used to estimate lean body mass versus ECFV. Adjunctive tools include clinical signs, such as skin-fold thickness, mid-arm muscle circumference, and additional laboratory tests such as serum pre-albumin and cholesterol levels. Nutritional guidelines for patients with CKD are summarized in the "Treatment" section below.

Endocrine-Metabolic Disturbances

Glucose metabolism is impaired in CKD, as evidenced by a slowing of the rate at which blood glucose levels decline after a glucose load. However, fasting blood glucose is usually normal or only slightly elevated, and the mild glucose intolerance does not require specific therapy. Because the kidney contributes to insulin removal from the circulation, plasma levels of insulin are slightly to moderately elevated in most uremic patients, both in the fasting and postprandial states. Because of this diminished renal degradation of insulin, patients on insulin therapy may need progressive reduction in dose as their renal function worsens. Many hypoglycemic agents require dose reduction in renal failure, and some, such as metformin, are contraindicated when the GFR is less than half of normal.

In women with CKD, estrogen levels are low, and menstrual abnormalities and inability to carry pregnancies to term are common. When the GFR has declined to 40 mL/min, pregnancy is associated with a high rate of spontaneous abortion, with only 20% of pregnancies leading to live births, and pregnancy may hasten the progression of the kidney disease itself. Women with CKD who are contemplating pregnancy should consult first with a nephrologist in conjunction with an obstetrician specializing in high-risk pregnancy. Men with CKD have reduced plasma testosterone levels, and sexual dysfunction and oligospermia may supervene. Sexual maturation may be delayed or impaired in adolescent children with CKD, even among those treated with dialysis. Many of these abnormalities improve or reverse with intensive dialysis or most importantly with successful renal transplantation.

Dermatologic Abnormalities

Abnormalities of the skin are prevalent in progressive CKD. Pruritus is quite common and one of the most vexing manifestations of the uremic state. In advanced CKD, even on dialysis, patients may become more pigmented, and this is felt to reflect the deposition of retained pigmented metabolites, or urochromes. Although many of the cutaneous abnormalities improve with dialysis, pruritus is often tenacious. The first lines of management are to rule out unrelated skin disorders, such as scabies, and to treat hyperphosphatemia, which can cause itch. EPO therapy was initially reported to improve uremic pruritus, although that is not always the case. Local moisturizers, mild topical glucocorticoids, oral antihistamines, and ultraviolet radiation have been reported to be helpful.

A skin condition unique to CKD patients called nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy consists of progressive subcutaneous induration, especially on the arms and legs. The condition is similar to scleromyxedema and is seen in patients with CKD who have been exposed to the magnetic resonance contrast agent gadolinium. Current recommendations are that patients with CKD stage 2 (GFR 30每59 mL/min) should minimize exposure to gadolinium, and those with CKD stages 3每5 (GFR < 30 mL/min) should avoid the use of gadolinium agents unless it is medically necessary. Concomitant liver disease appears to be a risk factor. However, no patient should be denied an imaging investigation that is critical to clinical management, and under such circumstances, rapid removal of gadolinium by hemodialysis (even in patients not yet receiving renal replacement therapy) shortly after the imaging procedure may mitigate this sometimes devastating complication
 
Evaluation and Management of Patients with CKD

Initial Approach

History and Physical Examination

Symptoms and overt signs of kidney disease are often subtle or absent until renal failure supervenes. Thus, the diagnosis of kidney disease often surprises patients and may be a cause of skepticism and denial. Particular aspects of the history that are germane to renal disease include a history of hypertension (which can cause CKD or more commonly be a consequence of CKD), diabetes mellitus, abnormal urinalyses, and problems with pregnancy such as preeclampsia or early pregnancy loss. A careful drug history should be elicited: patients may not volunteer use of analgesics, for example. Other drugs to consider include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, gold, penicillamine, antimicrobials, chemotherapeutic agents, antiretroviral agents, proton pump inhibitors, phosphate-containing bowel cathartics, and lithium, as well as prior exposure to medical imaging radiocontrast agents. In evaluating the uremic syndrome, questions about appetite, weight loss, nausea, hiccups, peripheral edema, muscle cramps, pruritus, and restless legs are especially helpful. A careful family history of kidney disease, together with assessment of manifestations in other organ systems such as auditory, visual, integumentary and others, may lead to the diagnosis of a heritable form of CKD (e.g., Alport or Fabry syndrome, cystinuria, among others) or shared environmental exposure to nephrotoxic agents (e.g., heavy metals, aristolochic acid). It should be noted that clustering of CKD, sometimes of different etiologies, is often observed within families.

The physical examination should focus on blood pressure and target organ damage from hypertension. Thus, funduscopy and precordial examination (left ventricular heave, a fourth heart sound) should be carried out. Funduscopy is important in the diabetic patient, as it may show evidence of diabetic retinopathy, which is associated with nephropathy. Other physical examination manifestations of CKD include edema and sensory polyneuropathy. The finding of asterixis or a pericardial friction rub not attributable to other causes usually signifies the presence of the uremic syndrome.

Laboratory Investigation

Laboratory studies should focus on a search for clues to an underlying causative or aggravating disease process and on the degree of renal damage and its consequences. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis, looking for multiple myeloma, should be obtained in all patients >35 years with unexplained CKD, especially if there is associated anemia and elevated, or even inappropriately normal, serum calcium concentration in the face of renal insufficiency. In the presence of glomerulonephritis, autoimmune diseases such as lupus and underlying infectious etiologies such as hepatitis B and C and HIV should be assessed. Serial measurements of renal function should be obtained to determine the pace of renal deterioration and ensure that the disease is truly chronic rather than acute or subacute and hence potentially reversible. Serum concentrations of calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and PTH should be measured to evaluate metabolic bone disease. Hemoglobin concentration, iron, B12, and folate should also be evaluated. A 24-h urine collection may be helpful, as protein excretion >300 mg may be an indication for therapy with ACE inhibitors or ARBs.

Imaging Studies

The most useful imaging study is a renal ultrasound, which can verify the presence of two kidneys, determine if they are symmetric, provide an estimate of kidney size, and rule out renal masses and evidence of obstruction. Since it takes time for kidneys to shrink as a result of chronic disease, the finding of bilaterally small kidneys supports the diagnosis of CKD of long-standing duration, with an irreversible component of scarring. If the kidney size is normal, it is possible that the renal disease is acute or subacute. The exceptions are diabetic nephropathy (where kidney size is increased at the onset of diabetic nephropathy before CKD with loss of GFR supervenes), amyloidosis, and HIV nephropathy, where kidney size may be normal in the face of CKD. Polycystic kidney disease that has reached some degree of renal failure will almost always present with enlarged kidneys with multiple cysts (Chap. 284). A discrepancy >1 cm in kidney length suggests either a unilateral developmental abnormality or disease process or renovascular disease with arterial insufficiency affecting one kidney more than the other. The diagnosis of renovascular disease can be undertaken with different techniques, including Doppler sonography, nuclear medicine studies, or CT or MRI studies. If there is a suspicion of reflux nephropathy (recurrent childhood urinary tract infection, asymmetric renal size with scars on the renal poles), a voiding cystogram may be indicated. However, in most cases by the time the patient has CKD, the reflux has resolved, and even if still present, repair does not improve renal function. Radiographic contrast imaging studies are not particularly helpful in the investigation of CKD. Intravenous or intraarterial dye should be avoided where possible in the CKD patient, especially with diabetic nephropathy, because of the risk of radiographic contrast dye每induced renal failure. When unavoidable, appropriate precautionary measures include avoidance of hypovolemia at the time of contrast exposure, minimization of the dye load, and choice of radiographic contrast preparations with the least nephrotoxic potential. Additional measures thought to attenuate contrast-induced worsening of renal function include judicious administration of sodium bicarbonate每containing solutions and N-acetyl-cysteine.

Renal Biopsy

In the patient with bilaterally small kidneys, renal biopsy is not advised because (1) it is technically difficult and has a greater likelihood of causing bleeding and other adverse consequences, (2) there is usually so much scarring that the underlying disease may not be apparent, and (3) the window of opportunity to render disease-specific therapy has passed. Other contraindications to renal biopsy include uncontrolled hypertension, active urinary tract infection, bleeding diathesis (including ongoing anticoagulation), and severe obesity. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsy is the favored approach, but a surgical or laparoscopic approach can be considered, especially in the patient with a single kidney where direct visualization and control of bleeding are crucial. In the CKD patient in whom a kidney biopsy is indicated (e.g., suspicion of a concomitant or superimposed active process such as interstitial nephritis or in the face of accelerated loss of GFR), the bleeding time should be measured, and, if increased, desmopressin should be administered immediately prior to the procedure.

A brief run of hemodialysis (without heparin) may also be considered prior to renal biopsy to normalize the bleeding time.

Establishing the Diagnosis and Etiology of CKD

The most important initial diagnostic step in the evaluation of a patient presenting with elevated serum creatinine is to distinguish newly diagnosed CKD from acute or subacute renal failure because the latter two conditions may respond to therapy specific to the disease. Previous measurements of serum creatinine concentration are particularly helpful in this regard. Normal values from recent months or even years suggest that the current extent of renal dysfunction could be more acute, and hence reversible, than might otherwise be appreciated. In contrast, elevated serum creatinine concentration in the past suggests that the renal disease represents the progression of a chronic process. Even if there is evidence of chronicity, there is the possibility of a superimposed acute process (e.g., ECFV depletion, urinary infection or obstruction, or nephrotoxin exposure) supervening on the chronic condition. If the history suggests multiple systemic manifestations of recent onset (e.g., fever, polyarthritis, and rash), it should be assumed that renal insufficiency is part of the acute process.

Some of the laboratory tests and imaging studies outlined above can be helpful. Evidence of metabolic bone disease with hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and elevated PTH and bone alkaline phosphatase levels suggests chronicity. Normochromic, normocytic anemia suggests that the process has been ongoing for some time. The finding of bilaterally reduced kidney size (<8.5 cm in all but the smallest adults) favors CKD.

While renal biopsy can usually be performed in early CKD (stages 1每3), it is not always indicated. For example, in a patient with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus for 15每20 years with retinopathy, nephrotic-range proteinuria, and absence of hematuria, the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy is very likely and biopsy is usually not necessary. However, if there were some other finding not typical of diabetic nephropathy, such as hematuria or white blood cell casts, or absence of diabetic retinopathy, some other disease may be present and a biopsy may be indicated. Ischemic nephropathy is usually diagnosed clinically by the presence of long-standing hypertension, evidence of ischemic disease elsewhere (e.g., cardiac or peripheral vascular disease), and the finding of nonnephrotic proteinuria in the absence of urinary blood or red cell casts. It is important to consider progressive ischemic nephropathy because a small subset of these patients may respond to revascularization procedures, although this remains controversial.

In the absence of a clinical diagnosis, renal biopsy may be the only recourse to establish an etiology in early-stage CKD. However, as noted above, once the CKD is advanced and the kidneys are small and scarred, there is little utility and significant risk in attempting to arrive at a specific diagnosis.

Treatment: Chronic Kidney Disease

Treatments aimed at specific causes of CKD are discussed elsewhere. Among others, these include optimized glucose control in diabetes mellitus, immunomodulatory agents for glomerulonephritis, and emerging specific therapies to retard cytogenesis in polycystic kidney disease. The optimal timing of both specific and nonspecific therapy is usually well before there has been a measurable decline in GFR and certainly before CKD is established (Table 280-6). It is helpful to sequentially measure and plot the rate of decline of GFR in all patients. Any acceleration in the rate of decline should prompt a search for superimposed acute or subacute processes that may be reversible. These include ECFV depletion, uncontrolled hypertension, urinary tract infection, new obstructive uropathy, exposure to nephrotoxic agents [such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or radiographic dye], and reactivation or flare of the original disease, such as lupus or vasculitis.

Slowing the Progression of CKD

There is variation in the rate of decline of GFR among patients with CKD. However, the following interventions should be considered in an effort to stabilize or slow the decline of renal function.

Reducing Intraglomerular Hypertension and Proteinuria

Increased intraglomerular filtration pressures and glomerular hypertrophy develop as a response to loss of nephron number from different kidney diseases. This response is maladaptive, as it promotes the ongoing decline of kidney function even if the inciting process has been treated or spontaneously resolved. Control of systemic and glomerular hypertension is important in slowing the progression of CKD. Therefore, in addition to reduction of cardiovascular disease risk, antihypertensive therapy in patients with CKD also aims to slow the progression of nephron injury by reducing intraglomerular hypertension. Elevated blood pressure increases proteinuria by increasing its flux across the glomerular capillaries. Conversely, the renoprotective effect of antihypertensive medications is gauged through the consequent reduction of proteinuria. Thus, the more effective a given treatment is in lowering protein excretion, the greater the subsequent impact on protection from decline in GFR. This observation is the basis for the treatment guideline establishing 125/75 mmHg as the target blood pressure in proteinuric CKD patients.

ACE inhibitors and ARBs inhibit the angiotensin-induced vasoconstriction of the efferent arterioles of the glomerular microcirculation. This inhibition leads to a reduction in both intraglomerular filtration pressure and proteinuria. Several controlled studies have shown that these drugs are effective in slowing the progression of renal failure in patients with advanced stages of both diabetic and nondiabetic CKD. This slowing in progression of CKD is strongly associated with the proteinuria-lowering effect. In the absence of an anti-proteinuric response with either agent alone, combined treatment with both ACE inhibitors and ARBs has been considered. The combination is associated with a greater reduction in proteinuria compared to either agent alone. Insofar as reduction in proteinuria is a surrogate for improved renal outcome, the combination would appear to be advantageous. However, a recent randomized, controlled study found a greater incidence of acute renal failure and adverse cardiac events from such combination therapy. It is uncertain, therefore, whether the ACE plus ARB therapy can be advised routinely. Adverse effects from these agents include cough and angioedema with ACE inhibitors, anaphylaxis, and hyperkalemia with either class. A progressive increase in serum creatinine concentration with these agents may suggest the presence of renovascular disease within the large or small arteries. Development of these side effects may mandate the use of second-line antihypertensive agents instead of the ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Among the calcium channel blockers, diltiazem and verapamil may exhibit superior antiproteinuric and renoprotective effects compared to the dihydropyridines. At least two different categories of response can be considered: one in which progression is strongly associated with systemic and intraglomerular hypertension and proteinuria (e.g., diabetic nephropathy, glomerular diseases) and in which ACE inhibitors and ARBs are likely to be the first choice; and another in which proteinuria is mild or absent initially (e.g., adult polycystic kidney disease and other tubulointerstitial diseases), where the contribution of intraglomerular hypertension is less prominent, and other antihypertensive agents can be useful for control of systemic hypertension.

Slowing Progression of Diabetic Renal Disease

(See also Chap. 344) Diabetic nephropathy is now the leading cause of CKD requiring renal replacement therapy in many parts of the world, and its prevalence is increasing disproportionately in the developing world. Furthermore, the prognosis of diabetic patients on dialysis is poor, with survival comparable to many forms of cancer. Accordingly, it is mandatory to develop strategies whose aim is to prevent or slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy in these patients.

Control of Blood Glucose

Excellent glycemic control reduces the risk of kidney disease and its progression in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is recommended that plasma values for preprandial glucose be kept in the 5.0每7.2 mmol/L (90每130 mg/dL) range and hemoglobin A1C should be < 7%. As the GFR decreases with progressive nephropathy, the use and dose of oral hypoglycemics needs to be reevaluated. For example, chlorpropamide may be associated with prolonged hypoglycemia in patients with decreased renal function; metformin can cause lactic acidosis in the patient with renal impairment and should be discontinued when the GFR is reduced; and the thiazolidinediones (e.g., rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, and others), may increase renal salt and water absorption and aggravate volume-overload states, and contribute to adverse cardiovascular events. Finally, as renal function declines, renal degradation of administered insulin will also decline, so that less insulin may be required for glycemic control.

Control of Blood Pressure and Proteinuria

Hypertension is found in the majority of type 2 diabetic patients at diagnosis. This finding correlates with the presence of albuminuria and is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events and nephropathy. Microalbuminuria, the finding of albumin in the urine not detectable by the urine dipstick, precedes the decline in GFR and heralds renal and cardiovascular complications. Testing for microalbumin is recommended in all diabetic patients, at least annually. If the patient already has established proteinuria, then testing for microalbumin is not necessary. Antihypertensive treatment reduces albuminuria and diminishes its progression even in normotensive diabetic patients. In addition to treatment of hypertension in general, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in particular is associated with additional renoprotection. These salutary effects are mediated by reducing intraglomerular pressure and inhibition of angiotensin-driven sclerosing pathways, in part through inhibition of TGF--mediated pathways. Recent studies have highlighted the benefit of renin-angiotensin axis blockade on the development of retinopathy in diabetic patients, but do not necessarily show a clear-cut renal benefit of intervention at the very earliest stages, prior to onset of overt proteinuria. In any case, as noted above, the combination of ACE inhibitors with ARBs is not recommended.

Protein Restriction

While protein restriction has been advocated to reduce symptoms associated with uremia, it may also slow the rate of renal decline at earlier stages of renal disease. This concept is based on clinical and experimental evidence that protein-mediated hyperfiltration contributes to ongoing decline in renal function in many different forms of renal disease. A number of studies have shown that protein restriction may be effective in slowing the progression of CKD, especially proteinuric and diabetic renal diseases. However, the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study was unable to demonstrate a robust benefit in delaying progression to advanced stages of CKD with dietary restriction of protein intake. Nonetheless, restriction of dietary protein intake has been recommended for CKD patients. KDOQI clinical practice guidelines include a daily protein intake of between 0.60 and 0.75 g/kg per day, depending upon patient adherence, comorbid disease, presence of proteinuria, and nutritional status. It is further advised that at least 50% of the protein intake be of high biologic value. As patients approach stage 5 CKD, spontaneous protein intake tends to decrease, and patients may enter a state of protein-energy malnutrition. In these circumstances, a protein intake of up to 0.90 g/kg per day might be recommended, again with an emphasis on proteins of high biologic value.

Sufficient energy intake is important to prevent protein-calorie malnutrition, and 35 kcal/kg is recommended. Monitoring of parameters of nutritional status must accompany the dietary intervention, using the parameters outlined above in the section on GI and nutritional abnormalities

Managing Other Complications of Chronic Kidney Disease

Medication Dose Adjustment

Although the loading dose of most drugs is not affected by CKD because no renal elimination is used in the calculation, the maintenance doses of many drugs will need to be adjusted. For those agents in which >70% excretion is by a nonrenal route, such as hepatic elimination, dose adjustment may not be needed. Some drugs that should be avoided include metformin, meperidine, and oral hypoglycemics that are eliminated by the kidney. NSAIDs should be avoided because of the risk of further worsening of kidney function. Many antibiotics, antihypertensives, and antiarrhythmics may require a reduction in dosage or change in the dose interval. Several online web-based databases for dose adjustment of medications according to stage of CKD or estimated GFR are available (e.g., http://www.globalrph.com/renaldosing2.htm). Nephrotoxic medical imaging radiocontrast agents and gadolinium should be avoided or used according to strict guidelines when medically necessary as described above.

Preparation for Renal Replacement Therapy

(See also Chap. 282) Temporary relief of symptoms and signs of impending uremia, such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, lassitude, and pruritus, may sometimes be achieved with protein restriction. However, this carries a significant risk of protein-energy malnutrition, and thus plans for more long-term management should be in place.

Maintenance dialysis and kidney transplantation has extended the lives of hundreds of thousands of patients with CKD worldwide. Clear indications for initiation of renal replacement therapy for patients with CKD include uremic pericarditis, encephalopathy, intractable muscle cramping, anorexia, and nausea not attributable to reversible causes such as peptic ulcer disease, evidence of malnutrition, and fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, principally hyperkalemia or ECF volume overload, that are refractory to other measures.

Recommendations for the optimal time for initiation of renal replacement therapy have been established by the National Kidney Foundation in their KDOQI Guidelines and are based on recent evidence demonstrating that delaying initiation of renal replacement therapy until patients are malnourished or have severe uremic complications leads to a worse prognosis on dialysis or with transplantation. Because of the interindividual variability in the severity of uremic symptoms and renal function, it is ill-advised to assign an arbitrary urea nitrogen or creatinine level to the need to start dialysis. Moreover, patients may become accustomed to chronic uremia and deny symptoms, only to find that they feel better with dialysis and realize in retrospect how poorly they were feeling before its initiation.

Previous studies suggested that starting dialysis before the onset of severe symptoms and signs of uremia were associated with prolongation of survival. This led to the concept of "healthy" start and is congruent with the philosophy that it is better to keep patients feeling well all along rather than allowing them to become ill with uremia before trying to return them to better health with dialysis or transplantation. Although recent studies have not confirmed a clear association of early-start dialysis with improved patient survival, there is still merit in this approach. On a practical level, advanced preparation may help to avoid problems with the dialysis process itself (e.g., a poorly functioning fistula for hemodialysis or malfunctioning peritoneal dialysis catheter) and thus preempt the morbidity associated with resorting to the insertion of temporary hemodialysis access with its attendant risks of sepsis, bleeding, and thrombosis.

Patient Education

Social, psychological, and physical preparation for the transition to renal replacement therapy and the choice of the optimal initial modality are best accomplished with a gradual approach involving a multidisciplinary team. Along with conservative measures discussed in the sections above, it is important to prepare patients with an intensive educational program, explaining the likelihood and timing of initiation of renal replacement therapy and the various forms of therapy available. The more knowledgeable that patients are about hemodialysis (both in-center and home-based), peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation, the easier and more appropriate will be their decisions. Patients who are provided with educational programs are more likely to choose home-based dialysis therapy. This approach is of societal benefit because home-based therapy is less expensive and is associated with improved quality of life. The educational programs should be commenced no later than stage 4 CKD so that the patient has sufficient time and cognitive function to learn the important concepts, to make informed choices, and implement preparatory measures for renal replacement therapy.

Exploration of social service support is also important. In those who may perform home dialysis or undergo preemptive renal transplantation, early education of family members for selection and preparation of a home dialysis helper, or a biologically or emotionally related potential living kidney donor, should occur long before the onset of symptomatic renal failure.

Kidney transplantation (Chap. 282) offers the best potential for complete rehabilitation, because dialysis replaces only a small fraction of the kidneys' filtration function and none of the other renal functions, including endocrine and anti-inflammatory effects. Generally, kidney transplantation follows a period of dialysis treatment, although preemptive kidney transplantation (usually from a living donor) can be carried out if it is certain that the renal failure is irreversible.

Implications for Global Health

In distinction to the natural decline and successful eradication of many devastating infectious diseases, there is rapid growth in the prevalence of metabolic and vascular disease in developing countries. Diabetes mellitus is becoming increasingly prevalent in these countries, perhaps due in part to change in dietary habits, diminished physical activity, and weight gain. Therefore, it follows that there will be a proportionate increase in vascular and renal disease. Healthcare agencies must plan for improved screening for early detection, prevention, and treatment plans in these nations and must start considering options for improved availability of renal replacement therapies.

Dialysis in the Treatment of Renal Failure: Introduction

Dialysis may be required for the treatment of either acute or chronic kidney disease. The use of continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRTs) and slow low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) is specific to the management of acute renal failure and is discussed in Chap. 279. These modalities are performed continuously (CRRT) or over 6每12 hours per session (SLED), in contrast to the 3每4 hours of an intermittent hemodialysis session. Advantages and disadvantages of CRRT and SLED are discussed in Chap. 279.

Peritoneal dialysis is rarely used in developed countries for the treatment of acute renal failure because of the increased risk of infection and (as will be discussed in more detail below) less efficient clearance per unit of time. The focus of the majority of this chapter will be on the use of peritoneal and hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

With the widespread availability of dialysis, the lives of hundreds of thousands of patients with ESRD have been prolonged. In the United States alone, there are now approximately 530,000 patients with ESRD, the vast majority of whom require dialysis. The incidence rate for ESRD is 350 cases per million population per year. The incidence of ESRD is disproportionately higher in African Americans (approximately 1000 per million population per year) as compared with white Americans (275 per million population per year). In the United States, the leading cause of ESRD is diabetes mellitus, currently accounting for nearly 55% of newly diagnosed cases of ESRD. Approximately one-third (33%) of patients have ESRD that has been attributed to hypertension, although it is unclear whether in these cases hypertension is the cause or a consequence of vascular disease or other unknown causes of kidney failure. Other prevalent causes of ESRD include glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, and obstructive uropathy.

Globally, mortality rates for patients with ESRD are lowest in Europe and Japan but very high in the developing world because of the limited availability of dialysis. In the United States, the mortality rate of patients on dialysis is approximately 18每20% per year, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 30每35%. Deaths are due mainly to cardiovascular diseases and infections (approximately 50 and 15% of deaths, respectively). Older age, male sex, nonblack race, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, and underlying heart disease are important predictors of death.
 
Treatment Options for ESRD Patients

Commonly accepted criteria for initiating patients on maintenance dialysis include the presence of uremic symptoms, the presence of hyperkalemia unresponsive to conservative measures, persistent extracellular volume expansion despite diuretic therapy, acidosis refractory to medical therapy, a bleeding diathesis, and a creatinine clearance or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) below 10 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (see Chap. 280 for estimating equations). Timely referral to a nephrologist for advanced planning and creation of a dialysis access, education about ESRD treatment options, and management of the complications of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), including hypertension, anemia, acidosis, and secondary hyperparathyroidism, is advisable. Recent data have suggested that a sizable fraction of ESRD cases result following episodes of acute renal failure, particularly among persons with underlying CKD.

In ESRD, treatment options include hemodialysis (in center or at home); peritoneal dialysis, as either continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis (CCPD); or transplantation (Chap. 282). Although there are significant geographic variations and differences in practice patterns, hemodialysis remains the most common therapeutic modality for ESRD (>90% of patients) in the United States. In contrast to hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis is continuous, but much less efficient, in terms of solute clearance. While no large-scale clinical trials have been completed comparing outcomes among patients randomized to either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, outcomes associated with both therapies are similar in most reports, and the decision of which modality to select is often based on personal preferences and quality-of-life considerations.
 
Hemodialysis

Hemodialysis relies on the principles of solute diffusion across a semipermeable membrane. Movement of metabolic waste products takes place down a concentration gradient from the circulation into the dialysate. The rate of diffusive transport increases in response to several factors, including the magnitude of the concentration gradient, the membrane surface area, and the mass transfer coefficient of the membrane. The latter is a function of the porosity and thickness of the membrane, the size of the solute molecule, and the conditions of flow on the two sides of the membrane. According to laws of diffusion, the larger the molecule, the slower its rate of transfer across the membrane. A small molecule, such as urea (60 Da), undergoes substantial clearance, whereas a larger molecule, such as creatinine (113 Da), is cleared less efficiently. In addition to diffusive clearance, movement of waste products from the circulation into the dialysate may occur as a result of ultrafiltration. Convective clearance occurs because of solvent drag, with solutes being swept along with water across the semipermeable dialysis membrane.

The Dialyzer

There are three essential components to hemodialysis: the dialyzer, the composition and delivery of the dialysate, and the blood delivery system (Fig. 281-1). The dialyzer is a plastic chamber with the ability to perfuse blood and dialysate compartments simultaneously at very high flow rates. The surface area of modern dialysis membranes in adult patients is usually in the range of 1.5每2.0 m2. The hollow-fiber dialyzer is the most common in use in the United States. These dialyzers are composed of bundles of capillary tubes through which blood circulates while dialysate travels on the outside of the fiber bundle.

Schema for hemodialysis.
 
 

Recent advances have led to the development of many different types of membrane material. Broadly, there are four categories of dialysis membranes: cellulose, substituted cellulose, cellulosynthetic, and synthetic. Over the past three decades, there has been a gradual switch from cellulose-derived to synthetic membranes, because the latter are more "biocompatible." Bioincompatibility is generally defined as the ability of the membrane to activate the complement cascade. Cellulosic membranes are bioincompatible because of the presence of free hydroxyl groups on the membrane surface. In contrast, with the substituted cellulose membranes (e.g., cellulose acetate) or the cellulosynthetic membranes, the hydroxyl groups are chemically bound to either acetate or tertiary amino groups, resulting in limited complement activation. Synthetic membranes, such as polysulfone, polymethylmethacrylate, and polyacrylonitrile membranes, are even more biocompatible because of the absence of these hydroxyl groups. The majority of dialyzers now manufactured in the United States are derived from polysulfone or newer derivatives (polyarylethersulfone).

Reprocessing and reuse of hemodialyzers are often employed for patients on maintenance hemodialysis in the United States. However, as the manufacturing costs for disposable dialyzers have declined, more and more outpatient dialysis facilities are no longer reprocessing dialyzers. In most centers employing reuse, only the dialyzer unit is reprocessed and reused, whereas in the developing world blood lines are also frequently reused. The reprocessing procedure can be either manual or automated. It consists of the sequential rinsing of the blood and dialysate compartments with water, a chemical cleansing step with reverse ultrafiltration from the dialysate to the blood compartment, the testing of the patency of the dialyzer, and, finally, disinfection of the dialyzer. Formaldehyde, peracetic acid每hydrogen peroxide, glutaraldehyde, and bleach have all been used as reprocessing agents.

Dialysate

The potassium concentration of dialysate may be varied from 0 to 4 mmol/L depending on the predialysis serum potassium concentration. The usual dialysate calcium concentration in U.S. hemodialysis centers is 1.25 mmol/L (2.5 meq/L, although modification may be required in selected settings (e.g., higher dialysate calcium concentrations may be used in patients with hypocalcemia associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism or following parathyroidectomy). The usual dialysate sodium concentration is 140 mmol/L. Lower dialysate sodium concentrations are associated with a higher frequency of hypotension, cramping, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and dizziness in some patients, although may attenuate thirst. In patients who frequently develop hypotension during their dialysis run, "sodium modeling" to counterbalance urea-related osmolar gradients is often employed. With sodium modeling, the dialysate sodium concentration is gradually lowered from the range of 145每155 mmol/L to isotonic concentrations (140 mmol/L) near the end of the dialysis treatment, typically declining either in steps or in a linear or exponential fashion. Higher dialysate sodium concentrations and sodium modeling may predispose patients to positive sodium balance; thus, these strategies to ameliorate intradialytic hypotension may be undesirable in hypertensive patients or in patients with large interdialytic weight gains. Because patients are exposed to approximately 120 L of water during each dialysis treatment, water used for the dialysate is subjected to filtration, softening, deionization, and, ultimately, reverse osmosis. During the reverse osmosis process, water is forced through a semipermeable membrane at very high pressure to remove microbiologic contaminants and >90% of dissolved ions.

Blood Delivery System

The blood delivery system is composed of the extracorporeal circuit in the dialysis machine and the dialysis access. The dialysis machine consists of a blood pump, dialysis solution delivery system, and various safety monitors. The blood pump moves blood from the access site, through the dialyzer, and back to the patient. The blood flow rate may range from 250每500 mL/min, depending largely on the type and integrity of the vascular access. Negative hydrostatic pressure on the dialysate side can be manipulated to achieve desirable fluid removal or ultrafiltration. Dialysis membranes have different ultrafiltration coefficients (i.e., mL removed/min per mmHg) so that along with hydrostatic changes, fluid removal can be varied. The dialysis solution delivery system dilutes the concentrated dialysate with water and monitors the temperature, conductivity, and flow of dialysate.

Dialysis Access

The fistula, graft, or catheter through which blood is obtained for hemodialysis is often referred to as a dialysis access. A native fistula created by the anastomosis of an artery to a vein (e.g., the Brescia-Cimino fistula, in which the cephalic vein is anastomosed end-to-side to the radial artery) results in arterialization of the vein. This facilitates its subsequent use in the placement of large needles (typically 15 gauge) to access the circulation. Although fistulas have the highest long-term patency rate of all dialysis access options, fistulas are created in a minority of patients in the United States. Many patients undergo placement of an arteriovenous graft (i.e., the interposition of prosthetic material, usually polytetrafluoroethylene, between an artery and a vein) or a tunneled dialysis catheter. In recent years, nephrologists, vascular surgeons, and health care policy makers in the United States have encouraged creation of arteriovenous fistulas in a larger fraction of patients (the "fistula first" initiative). Unfortunately, even when created, arteriovenous fistulas may not mature sufficiently to provide reliable access to the circulation, or they may thrombose early in their development. Novel surgical approaches (e.g., brachiobasilic fistula creation with transposition of the basilic vein fistula to the arm surface) have increased options for "native" vascular access.

Grafts and catheters tend to be used among persons with smaller-caliber veins or persons whose veins have been damaged by repeated venipuncture, or after prolonged hospitalization. The most important complication of arteriovenous grafts is thrombosis of the graft and graft failure, due principally to intimal hyperplasia at the anastomosis between the graft and recipient vein. When grafts (or fistulas) fail, catheter-guided angioplasty can be used to dilate stenoses; monitoring of venous pressures on dialysis and of access flow, although not routinely performed, may assist in the early recognition of impending vascular access failure. In addition to an increased rate of access failure, grafts and (in particular) catheters are associated with much higher rates of infection than fistulas.

Intravenous large-bore catheters are often used in patients with acute and chronic kidney disease. For persons on maintenance hemodialysis, tunneled catheters (either two separate catheters or a single catheter with two lumens) are often used when arteriovenous fistulas and grafts have failed or are not feasible due to anatomic considerations. These catheters are tunneled under the skin; the tunnel reduces bacterial translocation from the skin, resulting in a lower infection rate than with nontunneled temporary catheters. Most tunneled catheters are placed in the internal jugular veins; the external jugular, femoral, and subclavian veins may also be used.

Nephrologists, interventional radiologists, and vascular surgeons generally prefer to avoid placement of catheters into the subclavian veins; while flow rates are usually excellent, subclavian stenosis is a frequent complication and, if present, will likely prohibit permanent vascular access (i.e., a fistula or graft) in the ipsilateral extremity. Infection rates may be higher with femoral catheters. For patients with multiple vascular access complications and no other options for permanent vascular access, tunneled catheters may be the last "lifeline" for hemodialysis. Translumbar or transhepatic approaches into the inferior vena cava may be required if the superior vena cava or other central veins draining the upper extremities are stenosed or thrombosed.

Goals of Dialysis

The hemodialysis procedure is targeted at removing both low- and high-molecular-weight solutes. The procedure consists of pumping heparinized blood through the dialyzer at a flow rate of 300每500 mL/min, while dialysate flows in an opposite counter-current direction at 500每800 mL/min. The efficiency of dialysis is determined by blood and dialysate flow through the dialyzer as well as dialyzer characteristics (i.e., its efficiency in removing solute). The dose of dialysis, which is currently defined as a derivation of the fractional urea clearance during a single dialysis treatment, is further governed by patient size, residual kidney function, dietary protein intake, the degree of anabolism or catabolism, and the presence of comorbid conditions.

Since the landmark studies of Sargent and Gotch relating the measurement of the dose of dialysis using urea concentrations with morbidity in the National Cooperative Dialysis Study, the delivered dose of dialysis has been measured and considered as a quality assurance and improvement tool. While the fractional removal of urea nitrogen and derivations thereof are considered to be the standard methods by which "adequacy of dialysis" is measured, a large multicenter randomized clinical trial (the HEMO Study) failed to show a difference in mortality associated with a large difference in urea clearance. Still, multiple observational studies and widespread expert opinion have suggested that higher dialysis dose is warranted; current targets include a urea reduction ratio (the fractional reduction in blood urea nitrogen per hemodialysis session) of >65每70% and a body water每indexed clearance x time product (KT/V) above 1.2 or 1.05, depending on whether urea concentrations are "equilibrated." For the majority of patients with ESRD, between 9 and 12 h of dialysis are required each week, usually divided into three equal sessions. Several studies have suggested that longer hemodialysis session lengths may be beneficial (independent of urea clearance), although these studies are confounded by a variety of patient characteristics, including body size and nutritional status. Hemodialysis "dose" should be individualized, and factors other than the urea nitrogen should be considered, including the adequacy of ultrafiltration or fluid removal and control of hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and metabolic acidosis. Several authors have highlighted improved intermediate outcomes associated with more frequent hemodialysis (i.e., more than three times a week), although these studies are also confounded by multiple factors. A randomized clinical trial is currently under way to test whether more frequent dialysis results in differences in a variety of physiologic and functional markers.

Complications during Hemodialysis

Hypotension is the most common acute complication of hemodialysis, particularly among patients with diabetes mellitus. Numerous factors appear to increase the risk of hypotension, including excessive ultrafiltration with inadequate compensatory vascular filling, impaired vasoactive or autonomic responses, osmolar shifts, overzealous use of antihypertensive agents, and reduced cardiac reserve. Patients with arteriovenous fistulas and grafts may develop high output cardiac failure due to shunting of blood through the dialysis access; on rare occasions, this may necessitate ligation of the fistula or graft. Because of the vasodilatory and cardiodepressive effects of acetate, its use as the buffer in dialysate was once a common cause of hypotension. Since the introduction of bicarbonate-containing dialysate, dialysis-associated hypotension has become less common. The management of hypotension during dialysis consists of discontinuing ultrafiltration, the administration of 100每250 mL of isotonic saline or 10 mL of 23% saturated hypertonic saline, or administration of salt-poor albumin. Hypotension during dialysis can frequently be prevented by careful evaluation of the dry weight and by ultrafiltration modeling, such that more fluid is removed at the beginning rather than the end of the dialysis procedure. Additional maneuvers include the performance of sequential ultrafiltration followed by dialysis, cooling of the dialysate during dialysis treatment; and avoiding heavy meals during dialysis. Midodrine, a selective 1 adrenergic pressor agent, has been advocated by some practitioners, although there is insufficient evidence of its safety and efficacy to support its routine use.

Muscle cramps during dialysis are also a common complication of the procedure. The etiology of dialysis-associated cramps remains obscure. Changes in muscle perfusion because of excessively aggressive volume removal, particularly below the estimated dry weight, and the use of low-sodium每containing dialysate, have been proposed as precipitants of dialysis-associated cramps. Strategies that may be used to prevent cramps include reducing volume removal during dialysis, ultrafiltration profiling, and the use of higher concentrations of sodium in the dialysate or sodium modeling (see above).

Anaphylactoid reactions to the dialyzer, particularly on its first use, have been reported most frequently with the bioincompatible cellulosic-containing membranes. With the gradual phasing out of cuprophane membranes in the United States, dialyzer reactions have become uncommon. Dialyzer reactions can be divided into two types, A and B. Type A reactions are attributed to an IgE-mediated intermediate hypersensitivity reaction to ethylene oxide used in the sterilization of new dialyzers. This reaction typically occurs soon after the initiation of a treatment (within the first few minutes) and can progress to full-blown anaphylaxis if the therapy is not promptly discontinued. Treatment with steroids or epinephrine may be needed if symptoms are severe. The type B reaction consists of a symptom complex of nonspecific chest and back pain, which appears to result from complement activation and cytokine release. These symptoms typically occur several minutes into the dialysis run and typically resolve over time with continued dialysis.

Cardiovascular disease constitutes the major cause of death in patients with ESRD. Cardiovascular mortality and event rates are higher in dialysis patients than in patients posttransplantation, although rates are extraordinarily high in both populations. The underlying cause of cardiovascular disease is unclear but may be related to shared risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atherosclerotic and arteriosclerotic vascular disease), chronic inflammation, massive changes in extracellular volume (especially with high interdialytic weight gains), inadequate treatment of hypertension, dyslipidemia, anemia, dystrophic vascular calcification, hyperhomocysteinemia, and, perhaps, alterations in cardiovascular dynamics during the dialysis treatment. Few studies have targeted cardiovascular risk reduction in ESRD patients; none have demonstrated consistent benefit. Two clinical trials of statin agents in ESRD demonstrated significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations but no significant reductions in death or cardiovascular events [Die Deutsche Diabetes Dialyse Studie (4D) and AURORA studies]. Nevertheless, most experts recommend conventional cardioprotective strategies (e.g., lipid-lowering agents, aspirin, -adrenergic antagonists) in dialysis patients based on the patients' cardiovascular risk profile, which appears to be increased by more than an order of magnitude relative to persons unaffected by kidney disease.
 
Peritoneal Dialysis

In peritoneal dialysis, 1.5每3 L of a dextrose-containing solution is infused into the peritoneal cavity and allowed to dwell for a set period of time, usually 2每4 h. As with hemodialysis, toxic materials are removed through a combination of convective clearance generated through ultrafiltration and diffusive clearance down a concentration gradient. The clearance of solutes and water during a peritoneal dialysis exchange depends on the balance between the movement of solute and water into the peritoneal cavity versus absorption from the peritoneal cavity. The rate of diffusion diminishes with time and eventually stops when equilibration between plasma and dialysate is reached. Absorption of solutes and water from the peritoneal cavity occurs across the peritoneal membrane into the peritoneal capillary circulation and via peritoneal lymphatics into the lymphatic circulation. The rate of peritoneal solute transport varies from patient to patient and may be altered by the presence of infection (peritonitis), drugs, and physical factors such as position and exercise.

Forms of Peritoneal Dialysis

Peritoneal dialysis may be carried out as CAPD, CCPD, or a combination of both. In CAPD, dialysis solution is manually infused into the peritoneal cavity during the day and exchanged three to five times daily. A nighttime dwell is frequently instilled at bedtime and remains in the peritoneal cavity through the night. The drainage of spent dialysate is performed manually with the assistance of gravity to move fluid out of the abdomen. In CCPD, exchanges are performed in an automated fashion, usually at night; the patient is connected to an automated cycler that performs a series of exchange cycles while the patient sleeps. The number of exchange cycles required to optimize peritoneal solute clearance varies by the peritoneal membrane characteristics; as with hemodialysis, experts suggest careful tracking of solute clearances to ensure dialysis "adequacy."

Peritoneal dialysis solutions are available in volumes typically ranging from 1.5 to 3 L. Lactate is the preferred buffer in peritoneal dialysis solutions. The most common additives to peritoneal dialysis solutions are heparin to prevent obstruction of the dialysis catheter lumen with fibrin and antibiotics during an episode of acute peritonitis. Insulin may also be added in patients with diabetes mellitus.

Access to the Peritoneal Cavity

Access to the peritoneal cavity is obtained through a peritoneal catheter. Catheters used for maintenance peritoneal dialysis are flexible, being made of silicone rubber with numerous side holes at the distal end. These catheters usually have two Dacron cuffs to promote fibroblast proliferation, granulation, and invasion of the cuff. The scarring that occurs around the cuffs anchors the catheter and seals it from bacteria tracking from the skin surface into the peritoneal cavity; it also prevents the external leakage of fluid from the peritoneal cavity. The cuffs are placed in the preperitoneal plane and ~2 cm from the skin surface.

The peritoneal equilibrium test is a formal evaluation of peritoneal membrane characteristics that measures the transfer rates of creatinine and glucose across the peritoneal membrane. Patients are classified as low, low每average, high每average, and high transporters. Patients with rapid equilibration (i.e., high transporters) tend to absorb more glucose and lose efficiency of ultrafiltration with long daytime dwells. High transporters also tend to lose larger quantities of albumin and other proteins across the peritoneal membrane. In general, patients with rapid transporting characteristics require more frequent, shorter dwell time exchanges, nearly always obligating use of a cycler for feasibility. Slower (low and low每average) transporters tend to do well with fewer exchanges. The efficiency of solute clearance also depends on the volume of dialysate infused. Larger volumes allow for greater solute clearance, particularly with CAPD in patients with low and low每average transport characteristics. Interestingly, solute clearance also increases with physical activity, presumably related to more efficient flow dynamics within the peritoneal cavity.

As with hemodialysis, the optimal dose of peritoneal dialysis is unknown. Several observational studies have suggested that higher rates of urea and creatinine clearance (the latter generally measured in L/week) are associated with lower mortality rates and fewer uremic complications. However, a randomized clinical trial [Adequacy of Peritoneal Dialysis in Mexico (ADEMEX)] failed to show a significant reduction in mortality or complications with a relatively large increment in urea clearance. In general, patients on peritoneal dialysis do well when they retain residual kidney function. The rates of technique failure increase with years on dialysis and have been correlated with loss of residual function to a greater extent than loss of peritoneal membrane capacity. Recently, a nonabsorbable carbohydrate (icodextrin) has been introduced as an alternative osmotic agent. Studies have demonstrated more efficient ultrafiltration with icodextrin than with dextrose-containing solutions. Icodextrin is typically used as the "last fill" for patients on CCPD or for the longest dwell in patients on CAPD. For some patients in whom CCPD does not provide sufficient solute clearance, a hybrid approach can be adopted where one or more daytime exchanges are added to the CCPD regimen. While this approach can enhance solute clearance and prolong a patient's capacity to remain on peritoneal dialysis, the burden of the hybrid approach can be overwhelming to some.

Complications during Peritoneal Dialysis

The major complications of peritoneal dialysis are peritonitis, catheter-associated nonperitonitis infections, weight gain and other metabolic disturbances, and residual uremia (especially among patients with no residual kidney function).

Peritonitis typically develops when there has been a break in sterile technique during one or more of the exchange procedures. Peritonitis is usually defined by an elevated peritoneal fluid leukocyte count (100/mm3, of which at least 50% are polymorphonuclear neutrophils); these cutoffs are lower than in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis because of the presence of dextrose in peritoneal dialysis solutions and rapid bacterial proliferation in this environment without antibiotic therapy. The clinical presentation typically consists of pain and cloudy dialysate, often with fever and other constitutional symptoms. The most common culprit organisms are gram-positive cocci, including Staphylococcus, reflecting the origin from the skin. Gram-negative rod infections are less common; fungal and mycobacterial infections can be seen in selected patients, particularly after antibacterial therapy. Most cases of peritonitis can be managed either with intraperitoneal or oral antibiotics, depending on the organism; many patients with peritonitis do not require hospitalization. In cases where peritonitis is due to hydrophilic gram negative rods (e.g., Pseudomonas sp.) or yeast, antimicrobial therapy is usually not sufficient, and catheter removal is required to ensure complete eradication of infection. Nonperitonitis catheter-associated infections (often termed tunnel infections) vary widely in severity. Some cases can be managed with local antibiotic or silver nitrate administration, while others are severe enough to require parenteral antibiotic therapy and catheter removal.

Peritoneal dialysis is associated with a variety of metabolic complications. As noted above, albumin and other proteins can be lost across the peritoneal membrane in concert with the loss of metabolic wastes. The hypoproteinemia induced by peritoneal dialysis obligates a higher dietary protein intake in order to maintain nitrogen balance. Hyperglycemia and weight gain are also common complications of peritoneal dialysis. Several hundred calories in the form of dextrose are absorbed each day, depending on the concentration employed. Peritoneal dialysis patients, particularly those with type II diabetes mellitus, are then prone to other complications of insulin resistance, including hypertriglyceridemia. On the positive side, the continuous nature of peritoneal dialysis usually allows for a more liberal diet, due to continuous removal of potassium and phosphorus〞two major dietary components whose accumulation can be hazardous in ESRD.
 
Global Perspective

The incidence of ESRD is increasing worldwide with longer life expectancies and improved care of infectious and cardiovascular diseases. The management of ESRD varies widely by country and within country by region, and it is influenced by economic and other major factors. In general, peritoneal dialysis is more commonly performed in poorer countries owing to its lower expense and the high cost of establishing in-center hemodialysis units.

Transplantation in the Treatment of Renal Failure: Introduction

Transplantation of the human kidney is the treatment of choice for advanced chronic renal failure. Worldwide, tens of thousands of these procedures have been performed. When azathioprine and prednisone initially were used as immunosuppressive drugs in the 1960s, the results with properly matched familial donors were superior to those with organs from deceased donors: 75每90% compared with 50每60% graft survival rates at 1 year. During the 1970s and 1980s, the success rate at the 1-year mark for deceased-donor transplants rose progressively. Currently, deceased-donor grafts have an 89% 1-year survival and living-donor grafts have a 95% 1-year survival. Although there has been improvement in long-term survival, it has not been as impressive as the short-term survival, and currently the "average" (t1/2) life expectancy of a living-donor graft is around 20 years and that of a deceased-donor graft is close to 14 years.

Mortality rates after transplantation are highest in the first year and are age-related: 2% for ages 18每34 years, 3% for ages 35每49 years, and 6.8% for ages 50每60 years. These rates compare favorably with those in the chronic dialysis population even after risk adjustments for age, diabetes, and cardiovascular status. Occasionally, acute irreversible rejection may occur after many months of good function, especially if the patient neglects to take the prescribed immunosuppressive drugs. Most grafts, however, succumb at varying rates to a chronic process consisting of interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, vasculopathy, and glomerulopathy, the pathogenesis of which is incompletely understood. Overall, transplantation returns most patients to an improved lifestyle and an improved life expectancy compared with patients on dialysis. There are at least 100,000 patients with functioning kidney transplants in the United States, and when one adds in the numbers of kidney transplants in centers around the world, the total activity is doubled.
 
Recent Activity and Results

In 2008 there were more than 10,500 deceased-donor kidney transplants and 6000 living-donor transplants in the United States, with the ratio of deceased to living donors being stable over the last few years. The backlog of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has been increasing every year, and it always lags behind the number of available donors. As the number of patients with end-stage kidney disease increases, the demand for kidney transplants continues to increase. In 2008, 33,051 new registrants were added to the waiting list and under 17,000 patients were transplanted. This imbalance is set to worsen over the coming years with the predicted increased rates of obesity and diabetes worldwide. In an attempt to increase utilization of deceased-donor kidneys and reduce discard rates of organs, criteria for the use of so-called expanded criteria donor (ECD) kidneys and kidneys from donors after cardiac death (DCD) have been developed (Table 282-1). ECD kidneys are usually used for older patients who are expected to fare less well on dialysis.

II Unsuccessful resuscitation

aKidneys can be used for transplantation from categories II每V but are commonly only used from categories III and IV. The survival of these kidneys has not been shown to be inferior to that of deceased-donor kidneys.

Note: Kidneys can be bought ECD and DCD. ECD kidneys have been shown to have a poorer survival, and there is a separate shorter waiting list for ECD kidneys. They are generally utilized for patients for whom the benefits of being transplanted earlier outweigh the associated risks of using an ECD kidney.
 

The overall results of transplantation are presented in Table 282-2 as the survival of grafts and of patients. At the 1-year mark, graft survival is higher for living-donor recipients, most likely because those grafts are not subject to as much ischemic injury. The more powerful drugs now in use for immunosuppression have almost equalized the risk of graft rejection in all patients for the first year. At 5 and 10 years, however, there has been a steeper decline in survival of those with deceased-donor kidneys.

Recipient Selection

There are few absolute contraindications to renal transplantation. The transplant procedure is relatively noninvasive, as the organ is placed in the inguinal fossa without entering the peritoneal cavity. Recipients without perioperative complications often can be discharged from the hospital in excellent condition within 5 days of the operation.

Virtually all patients with ESRD who receive a transplant have a higher life expectancy than do risk-matched patients who remain on dialysis. Even though diabetic patients and older candidates have a higher mortality rate than other transplant recipients, their survival is improved with transplantation compared with remaining on dialysis. This global benefit of transplantation as a treatment modality poses substantial ethical issues for policy makers, as the number of deceased kidneys available is far from sufficient to meet the current needs of the candidates. The current standard of care is that the candidate should have a life expectancy of >5 years to be put on a deceased organ wait list. Even for living donation, the candidate should have >5 years of life expectancy. This standard has been established because the benefits of kidney transplantation over dialysis are realized only after a perioperative period in which the mortality rate is higher in transplanted patients than in dialysis patients with comparable risk profiles.

All candidates must have a thorough risk-versus-benefit evaluation before being approved for transplantation. In particular, an aggressive approach to diagnosis of correctable coronary artery disease, presence of latent or indolent infection (HIV, hepatitis B or C, tuberculosis), and neoplasm should be a routine part of the candidate workup. Most transplant centers consider overt AIDS and active hepatitis absolute contraindications to transplantation because of the high risk of opportunistic infection. Some centers are now transplanting individuals with hepatitis and even HIV infection under strict protocols to determine whether the risks and benefits favor transplantation over dialysis.

Among the few absolute "immunologic" contraindications to transplantation is the presence of a potentially harmful antibody against the donor kidney at the time of the anticipated transplant. Harmful antibodies that can cause very early graft loss include natural antibodies against the ABO blood group antigens and antibodies against human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I (A, B, C) or class II (DR) antigens. These antibodies are routinely excluded by proper screening of the candidate's ABO compatibility, HLA typing of donor and recipient, and direct cross-matching of candidate serum with lymphocytes of the donor.
 
Donor Selection

Donors can be deceased or volunteer living donors. The latter are usually family members selected to have at least partial compatibility for HLA antigens. Living volunteer donors should be normal on physical examination and of the same major ABO blood group, because crossing major blood group barriers prejudices survival of the allograft. It is possible, however, to transplant a kidney of a type O donor into an A, B, or AB recipient. Selective renal arteriography should be performed on donors to rule out the presence of multiple or abnormal renal arteries because the surgical procedure is difficult and the ischemic time of the transplanted kidney is long when there are vascular abnormalities. Transplant surgeons are now using a laparoscopic method to isolate and remove the living donor's kidney. This operation has the advantage of less evident surgical scars, and, because there is less tissue trauma, the laparoscopic donors have a substantially shorter hospital stay and less discomfort than those who have the traditional surgery. Deceased donors should be free of malignant neoplastic disease, hepatitis, and HIV because of possible transmission to the recipient. Increased risk of graft failure exists when the donor is elderly or has renal failure and when the kidney has a prolonged period of ischemia and storage.

In the United States, there is a coordinated national system of regulations, allocation support, and outcomes analysis for kidney transplantation called the Organ Procurement Transplant Network. It is now possible to remove deceased-donor kidneys and maintain them for up to 48 h on cold pulsatile perfusion or simple flushing and cooling. This approach permits adequate time for typing, cross-matching, transportation, and selection problems to be solved.
 
Tissue Typing and Clinical Immunogenetics

Matching for antigens of the HLA major histocompatibility gene complex (Chap. 315) is an important criterion for selection of donors for renal allografts. Each mammalian species has a single chromosomal region that encodes the strong, or major, transplantation antigens, and this region on the human sixth chromosome is called HLA. HLA antigens have been classically defined by serologic techniques, but methods to define specific nucleotide sequences in genomic DNA are increasingly being used. Other "minor" antigens may play crucial roles, in addition to the ABH(O) blood groups and endothelial antigens that are not shared with lymphocytes. The Rh system is not expressed on graft tissue. Evidence for designation of HLA as the genetic region that encodes major transplantation antigens comes from the success rate in living related donor renal and bone marrow transplantation, with superior results in HLA-identical sibling pairs. Nevertheless, 5% of HLA-identical renal allografts are rejected, often within the first weeks after transplantation. These failures represent states of prior sensitization to non-HLA antigens. Non-HLA minor antigens are relatively weak when initially encountered and are, therefore, suppressible by conventional immunosuppressive therapy. Once priming has occurred, however, secondary responses are much more refractory to treatment.

Living Donors

When first-degree relatives are donors, graft survival rates at 1 year are 5每7% greater than those for deceased-donor grafts. The 5-year survival rates still favor a partially matched (3/6 HLA mismatched) family donor over a randomly selected cadaver donor (Table 282-3). In addition, living donors provide the advantage of immediate availability. For both living and deceased donors, the 5-year outcomes are poor if there is a complete (6/6) HLA mismatch.

Table 282-3 Effect of HLA-A, -B, -DR Mismatching on Kidney Graft Survival

 
 
Degree of Donor Mismatch 1-Year Survival, % 5-Year Survival, % 
Cadaver donor (all) 89.2 61.3 
0/6-HLA mismatch 91.3 68.2 
3/6-HLA mismatch 90.1 60.8 
6/6-HLA mismatch 85.2 55.3 
Living related donor (all) 94.7 76.0 
0/6-HLA mismatch 96.7 87.0 
3/6-HLA mismatch 94.3 73.2 
6/6-HLA mismatch 92.7 57.7 
 


Note: 0-mismatched related donor transplants are virtually all from HLA-identical siblings, whereas 3/6-mismatched transplants can be one haplotype mismatched (1-A, 1-B, and 1-DR antigen) from a parent, child, or sibling; 6/6-HLA-mismatched living related kidneys are derived from siblings or relatives outside the nuclear family.
 

The survival rate of living unrelated renal allografts is as high as that of perfectly HLA-matched cadaver renal transplants and comparable to that of kidneys from living relatives. This outcome is probably a consequence of both short cold ischemia time and the extra care taken to document that the condition and renal function of the donor are optimal before proceeding with a living unrelated donation. It is illegal in the United States to purchase organs for transplantation.

Concern has been expressed about the potential risk to a volunteer kidney donor of premature renal failure after several years of increased blood flow and hyperfiltration per nephron in the remaining kidney. There are a few reports of the development of hypertension, proteinuria, and even lesions of focal segmental sclerosis in donors over long-term follow-up. Difficulties in donors followed for 20 years are unusual, however, and it may be that having a single kidney becomes significant only when another condition, such as hypertension, is superimposed. It is also desirable to consider the risk of development of type 1 diabetes mellitus in a family member who is a potential donor to a diabetic renal failure patient. Anti-insulin and anti-islet cell antibodies should be measured, and glucose tolerance tests should be performed in such donors to exclude a prediabetic state.

Presensitization

A positive cytotoxic cross-match of recipient serum with donor T lymphocytes representing anti-HLA class I is usually predictive of an acute vasculitic event termed hyperacute rejection. Patients with anti-HLA antibodies can be transplanted safely if careful cross-matching of donor blood lymphocytes with recipient serum is performed. The known sources of such sensitization are blood transfusion, a prior transplant, and pregnancy. Patients sustained by dialysis often show fluctuating antibody titers and specificity patterns. At the time of assignment of a cadaveric kidney, cross-matches are performed with at least a current serum. Previously analyzed antibody specificities and additional cross-matches are performed accordingly. The minimal purpose for the cross-match is avoidance of hyperacute rejection mediated by recipient antibodies to donor HLA class I antigens. More sensitive tests, such as the use of flow cytometry, can be useful for avoidance of accelerated, and often untreatable, early graft rejection in patients receiving second or third transplants. Donor T lymphocytes, which express only class I antigens, are used as targets for detection of anti每class I (HLA-A and -B) antibodies.

Preformed anti每class II (HLA-DR) antibodies against the donor carry a higher risk of graft loss as well, particularly in recipients who have suffered early loss of a prior kidney transplant. B lymphocytes expressing both class I and class II antigens are used in these assays. Non-HLA antigens restricted in expression to endothelium and sometimes monocytes have been described, but clinical relevance is not well established. A series of minor histocompatibility antigens do not elicit antibodies, and sensitization to these antigens is detectable only by cytotoxic T cells, an assay too cumbersome for routine use. Desensitization before transplantation by reducing the level of antidonor antibodies via plasmapheresis of blood and administration of pooled immunoglobulin or both has been useful in reducing the hazard of hyperacute rejection.
 
Immunology of Rejection

Both cellular and humoral (antibody-mediated) effector mechanisms can play roles in kidney transplant rejection. Antibodies can also initiate a form of antibody-dependent but cell-mediated cytotoxicity by recipient cells that bear receptors for the Fc portion of immunoglobulin.

Cellular rejection is mediated by lymphocytes that respond to HLA antigens expressed within the organ. The CD4+ lymphocyte responds to class II (HLA-DR) incompatibility by proliferating and releasing proinflammatory cytokines that augment the proliferative response of both CD4+ and CD8+ cells. CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocyte precursors respond primarily to class I (HLA-A, -B) antigens and mature into cytotoxic effector cells. The cytotoxic effector ("killer") T cells cause organ damage through direct contact and lysis of donor target cells. The natural role of HLA antigen molecules is to present processed peptide fragments of antigen to T lymphocytes, the fragments residing in a "groove" of the HLA molecule distal to the cell surface. T cells can be directly stimulated by intact nonself HLA molecules expressed on donor parenchymal cells and residual donor leukocytes residing in the kidney interstitium. In addition, donor HLA molecules can be processed by a variety of donor or recipient cells capable of antigen presentation of peptides and then presented to T cells in the same manner as most other antigens. The former mode of stimulation is sometimes called direct presentation, and the latter mode indirect presentation(Fig. 282-1). There is evidence that non-HLA antigens can also play a role in renal transplant rejection episodes. Recipients who receive a kidney from an HLA-identical sibling can have rejection episodes and require maintenance immunosuppression, whereas identical twin transplants require no immunosuppression. There are documented non-HLA antigens, such as an endothelial-specific antigen system with limited polymorphism and a tubular antigen, that can be targets of humoral or cellular rejection responses, respectively.

Figure 282-1

 
 
 
Recognition pathways for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. Graft rejection is initiated by CD4 helper T lymphocytes (TH) having antigen receptors that bind to specific complexes of peptides and MHC class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APC). In transplantation, in contrast to other immunologic responses, there are two sets of T cell clones involved in rejection. In the direct pathway the class II MHC of donor allogeneic APCs is recognized by CD4 TH cells that bind to the intact MHC molecule, and class I MHC allogeneic cells are recognized by CD8 T cells. The latter generally proliferate into cytotoxic cells (TC). In the indirect pathway, the incompatible MHC molecules are processed into peptides that are presented by the self-APCs of the recipient. The indirect, but not the direct, pathway is the normal physiologic process in T cell recognition of foreign antigens. Once TH cells are activated, they proliferate and, by secretion of cytokines and direct contact, exert strong helper effects on macrophages, TC, and B cells.

Immunosuppressive Treatment

Immunosuppressive therapy, as currently available, generally suppresses all immune responses, including those to bacteria, fungi, and even malignant tumors. In the 1950s, when clinical renal transplantation began, sublethal total-body irradiation was employed. We have now reached the point where sophisticated pharmacologic immunosuppression is available, but it still has the hazard of promoting infection and malignancy. In general, all clinically useful drugs are more selective to primary than to memory immune responses. Agents to suppress the immune response are discussed in the following paragraphs, and those currently in clinical use are listed in Table 282-4.

Drugs

Azathioprine, an analogue of mercaptopurine, was for two decades the keystone to immunosuppressive therapy in humans but has given way to more effective agents. This agent can inhibit synthesis of DNA, RNA, or both. Therapy with azathioprine in doses of 1.5每2 mg/kg per d is generally added to cyclosporine as a means of decreasing the requirements for the latter. Reduction in the dose is required because of leukopenia and occasionally thrombocytopenia. Excessive amounts of azathioprine may also cause jaundice, anemia, and alopecia. If it is essential to administer allopurinol concurrently, the azathioprine dose must be reduced. As inhibition of xanthine oxidase delays degradation, this combination is best avoided.

Mycophenolate mofetilor mycophenolate sodium, both of which are metabolized to mycophenolic acid, is now used in place of azathioprine in most centers. It has a similar mode of action and a mild degree of gastrointestinal toxicity but produces minimal bone marrow suppression. Its advantage is its increased potency in preventing or reversing rejection. Patients with hyperuricemia can be given allopurinol without adjustment of the mycophenolic acid dose. The usual dose is 2每3 g/d in divided doses.

Glucocorticoids are important adjuncts to immunosuppressive therapy. Among all the agents employed, prednisone has effects that are easiest to assess, and in large doses it is usually effective for the reversal of rejection. In general, 200每300 mg prednisone is given immediately before or at the time of transplantation, and the dose is reduced to 30 mg within a week. The side effects of the glucocorticoids, particularly impairment of wound healing and predisposition to infection, make it desirable to taper the dose as rapidly as possible in the immediate postoperative period. Many centers now have protocols for early discontinuance or avoidance of steroids because of long-term adverse effects on bone, skin, and glucose metabolism. For treatment of acute rejection, methylprednisolone, 0.5每1 g IV, is administered immediately upon diagnosis of beginning rejection and continued once daily for 3 days. When the drug is effective, the results are usually apparent within 96 h. Such "pulse" doses are not effective in chronic rejection. Most patients whose renal function is stable after 6 months or a year do not require large doses of prednisone; maintenance doses of 10每15 mg/d are the rule. Many patients tolerate an alternate-day course of steroids without an increased risk of rejection. A major effect of steroids is on the monocyte-macrophage system, preventing the release of interleukin (IL) 6 and IL-1.

Cyclosporine is a fungal peptide with potent immunosuppressive activity. It acts on the calcineurin pathway to block transcription of mRNA for IL-2 and other proinflammatory cytokines, thereby inhibiting T cell proliferation. Although it works alone, cyclosporine is more effective in conjunction with glucocorticoids and mycophenolate. Clinical results with tens of thousands of renal transplants have been impressive. Among its toxic effects (nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, hirsutism, tremor, gingival hyperplasia, diabetes), only nephrotoxicity presents a serious management problem and is further discussed below.

Tacrolimus (previously called FK506) is a fungal macrolide that has the same mode of action as cyclosporine as well as a similar side-effect profile; it does not, however, produce hirsutism or gingival hyperplasia. De novo diabetes mellitus is more common with tacrolimus. The drug was first used in liver transplantation and may substitute for cyclosporine entirely or be tried as an alternative in renal patients whose rejections are poorly controlled by cyclosporine.

Sirolimus (previously called rapamycin) is another fungal macrolide but has a different mode of action; i.e., it inhibits T cell growth factor signaling pathways, preventing the response to IL-2 and other cytokines. Sirolimus can be used in conjunction with cyclosporine or tacrolimus, or with mycophenolic acid, to avoid calcineurin inhibitors. Its use with tacrolimus alone shows promise as a steroid-sparing regimen, especially in patients who would benefit from pancreatic islet cell transplantation, where steroids have an adverse effect on islet survival.

Antibodies to Lymphocytes

When serum from animals made immune to host lymphocytes is injected into the recipient, a marked suppression of cellular immunity to the tissue graft results. The action on cell-mediated immunity is greater than the action on humoral immunity. A globulin fraction of serum [antilymphocyte globulin (ALG)] is the agent generally employed. For use in humans, peripheral human lymphocytes, thymocytes, or lymphocytes from spleens or thoracic duct fistulas have been injected into horses, rabbits, or goats to produce antilymphocyte serum, from which the globulin fraction is then separated. A rabbit antithymocyte globulin (thymoglobulin) is the agent most commonly in use currently. Monoclonal antibodies against defined lymphocyte subsets offer a more precise and standardized form of therapy. OKT3 is directed to the CD3 molecules that form a portion of the T cell antigen-receptor complex and is thus expressed on all mature T cells.

Another approach to more selective therapy is to target the 55-kDa alpha chain of the IL-2 receptor, which is expressed only on T cells that have been recently activated. Two such antibodies to the IL-2 receptor, in which either a chimeric protein has been made between mouse Fab with human Fc (basiliximab) or the antibody has been "humanized" by splicing the combining sites of the mouse into a molecule that is 90% human IgG (daclizumab), are in use for prophylaxis of acute rejection in the immediate posttransplant period. They are effective at decreasing the acute rejection rate and have few adverse side effects.

More recently, two new strategies have involved administration of engineered biologic agents: a depleting T cell antibody (alemtuzumab) as induction therapy to minimize maintenance immunosuppression and a fusion protein (Belatacept) to block B7 T cell costimulatory signals. The latter has shown promise in phase 2 trials and is currently being tested in phase 3 trials in kidney transplantation. Both of these new biologics as well as antilymphocyte globulin are increasingly being used as "induction" therapy at the time of transplantation to minimize or eliminate the use of either steroids or calcineurin inhibitors because of their perceived toxicities. The next step in the evolution of this therapeutic strategy, which has already been achieved in the short term in small numbers of immunologically well-matched patients, is the elimination of all maintenance immunosuppression therapy altogether.
 
Clinical Course and Management of the Recipient

Adequate hemodialysis should be performed within 48 h of surgery, and care should be taken that the serum potassium level is not markedly elevated so that intraoperative cardiac arrhythmias can be averted. The diuresis that commonly occurs postoperatively must be carefully monitored. In some instances, it may be massive, reflecting the inability of ischemic tubules to regulate sodium and water excretion; with large diureses, massive potassium losses may occur. Most chronically uremic patients have some excess of extracellular fluid, and it is useful to maintain an expanded fluid volume in the immediate postoperative period. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) may cause immediate oliguria or may follow an initial short period of graft function. ATN is most likely when cadaveric donors have been underperfused or if the interval between cessation of blood flow and organ harvest (warm ischemic time) is more than a few minutes. Recovery usually occurs within 3 weeks, although periods as long as 6 weeks have been reported. Superimposition of rejection on ATN is common, and the differential diagnosis may be difficult without a graft biopsy. Cyclosporine therapy prolongs ATN, and some patients do not diurese until the dose is reduced drastically. Many centers avoid starting cyclosporine for the first several days, using ALG or a monoclonal antibody along with mycophenolic acid and prednisone until renal function is established. Figure 282-2 illustrates an algorithm followed by many transplant centers for early posttransplant management of recipients at high or low risk of early renal dysfunction.

A typical algorithm for early posttransplant care of a kidney recipient. If any of the recipient or donor "high-risk" factors exist, more aggressive management is called for. Low-risk patients can be treated with a standard immunosuppressive regimen. Patients at higher risk of rejection or early ischemic and nephrotoxic transplant dysfunction are often induced with an antilymphocyte globulin to provide more potent early immunosuppression or to spare calcineurin nephrotoxicity. *When there is early transplant dysfunction, prerenal, obstructive, and vascular causes must be ruled out by ultrasonographic examination. The panel reactive antibody (PRA) is a quantitation of how much antibody is present in a candidate against a panel of cells representing the distribution of antigens in the donor pool. APC, antigen-presenting cell; MHC, major histocompatibility complex.
 
 

The Rejection Episode

Early diagnosis of rejection allows prompt institution of therapy to preserve renal function and prevent irreversible damage. Clinical evidence of rejection is rarely characterized by fever, swelling, and tenderness over the allograft. Rejection may present only with a rise in serum creatinine, with or without a reduction in urine volume. The focus should be on ruling out other causes of functional deterioration.

Doppler ultrasonography or magnetic resonance angiography may be useful in ascertaining changes in the renal vasculature and in renal blood flow, even in the absence of changes in urinary flow. Thrombosis of the renal vein occurs rarely; it may be reversible if it is caused by technical factors and intervention is prompt. Diagnostic ultrasound is the procedure of choice to rule out urinary obstruction or to confirm the presence of perirenal collections of urine, blood, or lymph. When renal function has been good initially, a rise in the serum creatinine level is the most sensitive and reliable indicator of possible rejection and may be the only sign.

Calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine and tacrolimus) may cause deterioration in renal function in a manner similar to a rejection episode. In fact, rejection processes tend to be more indolent with these inhibitors, and the only way to make a diagnosis may be by renal biopsy. Calcineurin inhibitors have an afferent arteriolar constrictor effect on the kidney and may produce permanent vascular and interstitial injury after sustained high-dose therapy. The addition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is likely to raise serum creatinine levels. The former are generally safe to use after the early months, whereas the latter are best avoided in all renal transplant patients. There is no universally accepted lesion that makes a diagnosis of calcineurin inhibitor toxicity, although interstitial fibrosis, isometric tubular vacuolization, and thickening of arteriolar walls have been noted by some. Basically, if the biopsy does not reveal moderate and active cellular rejection activity, the serum creatinine most likely will respond to a reduction in dose. Blood levels of drug can be useful if they are very high or very low but do not correlate precisely with renal function, although serial changes in a patient can be useful. If rejection activity is present in the biopsy, appropriate therapy is indicated. The first rejection episode is usually treated with IV administration of methylprednisolone, 500每1000 mg daily for 3 days. Failure to respond is an indication for antibody therapy, usually with OKT3 or antithymocyte globulin.

Biopsy may be necessary to confirm the presence of rejection; when evidence of antibody-mediated injury is present with endothelial injury and deposition of complement component C4d is detected by fluorescence labeling, one can usually detect the antibody in recipient blood. The prognosis is poor, and aggressive use of plasmapheresis, immunoglobulin infusions, or anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab) that targets B lymphocytes is indicated.

Management Problems

The usual clinical manifestations of infection in the posttransplant period are blunted by immunosuppressive therapy. The major toxic effect of azathioprine is bone marrow suppression, which is less likely with mycophenolic acid, whereas calcineurin inhibitors have no marrow effects. All drugs predispose to unusual opportunistic infections, however. The typical times after transplantation when the most common opportunistic infections occur are shown in Table 282-5. The signs and symptoms of infection may be masked or distorted. Fever without obvious cause is common, and only after days or weeks may it become apparent that it has a viral or fungal origin. Bacterial infections are most common during the first month after transplantation. The importance of blood cultures in such patients cannot be overemphasized because systemic infection without obvious foci is common, although wound infections with or without urinary fistulas are the most common. Particularly ominous are rapidly occurring pulmonary lesions, which may result in death within 5 days of onset. When these lesions become apparent, immunosuppressive agents should be discontinued, except for maintenance doses of prednisone.

Aggressive diagnostic procedures, including transbronchial and open-lung biopsy, are frequently indicated. In the case of Pneumocystis carinii (Chap. 207) infection, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the treatment of choice; amphotericin B has been used effectively in systemic fungal infections. Prophylaxis against P. carinii with daily or alternate-day low-dose TMP-SMX is very effective. Involvement of the oropharynx with Candida (Chap. 203) may be treated with local nystatin. Tissue-invasive fungal infections require treatment with systemic agents such as fluconazole. Small doses (a total of 300 mg) of amphotericin given over a period of 2 weeks may be effective in fungal infections refractory to fluconazole. Macrolide antibiotics, especially ketoconazole and erythromycin, and some calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) compete with calcineurin inhibitors for P450 catabolism and cause elevated levels of these immunosuppressive drugs. Analeptics, such as phenytoin and carbamazepine, will increase catabolism to result in low levels. Aspergillus (Chap. 204), Nocardia (Chap. 162), and especially cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Chap. 182) infections also occur.

CMV is a common and dangerous DNA virus in transplant recipients. It does not generally appear until the end of the first posttransplant month. Active CMV infection is sometimes associated, or occasionally confused, with rejection episodes. Patients at highest risk for severe CMV disease are those without anti-CMV antibodies who receive a graft from a CMV antibody每positive donor (15% mortality). Valganciclovir is a cost-effective and bioavailable oral form of ganciclovir that has been proved effective in both prophylaxis and treatment of CMV disease. Early diagnosis in a febrile patient with clinical suspicion of CMV disease can be made by determining CMV viral load in the blood. A rise in IgM antibodies to CMV is also diagnostic. Culture of CMV from blood may be less sensitive. Tissue invasion of CMV is common in the gastrointestinal tract and lungs. CMV retinopathy occurs late in the course, if untreated. Treatment of active CMV disease with valganciclovir is always indicated. In many patients immune to CMV, viral activation can occur with major immunosuppressive regimens.

The polyoma group (BK, JC, SV40) is another class of DNA viruses that can become dormant in kidneys and can be activated by immunosuppression. When reactivation occurs with BK, there is a 50% chance of progressive fibrosis and loss of the graft within 1 year by the activated virus. Risk of infection is associated with the overall degree of immunosuppression rather than the individual immunosuppressive drugs used. Renal biopsy is necessary for the diagnosis. There have been promising results with leflunomide, cidofovir, and quinolone anitibiotics (which are effective against polyoma helicase), but it is most important to reduce the immunosuppressive load.

The complications of glucocorticoid therapy are well known and include gastrointestinal bleeding, impairment of wound healing, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, cataract formation, and hemorrhagic pancreatitis. The treatment of unexplained jaundice in transplant patients should include cessation or reduction of immunosuppressive drugs if hepatitis or drug toxicity is suspected. Therapy in such circumstances often does not result in rejection of a graft, at least for several weeks. Acyclovir is effective in therapy for herpes simplex virus infections.

Chronic Lesions of the Transplanted Kidney

Although 1-year transplant survival is excellent, most recipients experience progressive decline in kidney function over time thereafter. Chronic renal transplant dysfunction can be caused by recurrent disease, hypertension, cyclosporine or tacrolimusnephrotoxicity, chronic immunologic rejection, secondary focal glomerulosclerosis, or a combination of these pathophysiologies. Chronic vascular changes with intimal proliferation and medial hypertrophy are commonly found. Control of systemic and intrarenal hypertension with ACE inhibitors is thought to have a beneficial influence on the rate of progression of chronic renal transplant dysfunction. Renal biopsy can distinguish subacute cellular rejection from recurrent disease or secondary focal sclerosis.
 
Malignancy

The incidence of tumors in patients on immunosuppressive therapy is 5每6%, or approximately 100 times greater than that in the general population in the same age range. The most common lesions are cancer of the skin and lips and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, as well as lymphomas such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The risks are increased in proportion to the total immunosuppressive load administered and the time elapsed since transplantation. Surveillance for skin and cervical cancers is necessary.

Other Complications

Hypercalcemia after transplantation may indicate failure of hyperplastic parathyroid glands to regress. Aseptic necrosis of the head of the femur is probably due to preexisting hyperparathyroidism, with aggravation by glucocorticoid treatment. With improved management of calcium and phosphorus metabolism during chronic dialysis, the incidence of parathyroid-related complications has fallen dramatically. Persistent hyperparathyroid activity may require subtotal parathyroidectomy.

Hypertension may be caused by (1) native kidney disease, (2) rejection activity in the transplant, (3) renal artery stenosis if an end-to-end anastomosis was constructed with an iliac artery branch, and (4) renal calcineurin inhibitor toxicity. This toxicity may improve with reduction in dose. Whereas ACE inhibitors may be useful, calcium channel blockers are more frequently used initially. Amelioration of hypertension to the range of 120每130/70每80 mmHg should be the goal in all patients.

Although most transplant patients have robust production of erythropoietin and normalization of hemoglobin, anemia is commonly seen in the posttransplant period. Often the anemia is attributable to bone marrow每suppressant immunosuppressive medications such as azathioprine, mycophenolic acid, and sirolimus. Gastrointestinal bleeding is a common side effect of high-dose and long-term steroid administration. Many transplant patients have creatinine clearances of 30每50 mL/min and can be considered in the same way as other patients with chronic renal insufficiency for anemia management, including supplemental erythropoietin.

Chronic hepatitis, particularly when due to hepatitis B virus, can be a progressive, fatal disease over a decade or so. Patients who are persistently hepatitis B surface antigen每positive are at higher risk, according to some studies, but the presence of hepatitis C virus is also a concern when one embarks on a course of immunosuppression in a transplant recipient.

Both chronic dialysis and renal transplant patients have a higher incidence of death from myocardial infarction and stroke than does the population at large, and this is particularly true in diabetic patients. Contributing factors are the use of glucocorticoids and sirolimus, as well as hypertension. Recipients of renal transplants have a high prevalence of coronary artery and peripheral vascular diseases. The percentage of deaths from these causes has been slowly rising as the numbers of transplanted diabetic patients and the average age of all recipients increase. More than 50% of renal recipient mortality is attributable to cardiovascular disease. In addition to strict control of blood pressure and blood lipid levels, close monitoring of patients for indications of further medical or surgical intervention is an important part of management.

Glomerular Diseases: Introduction

Two human kidneys harbor nearly 1.8 million glomerular capillary tufts. Each glomerular tuft resides within Bowman's space. The capsule circumscribing this space is lined by parietal epithelial cells that transition into tubular epithelia forming the proximal nephron or migrate into the tuft to replenish podocytes. The glomerular capillary tuft derives from an afferent arteriole that forms a branching capillary bed embedded in mesangial matrix (Fig. 283-1). This capillary network funnels into an efferent arteriole, which passes filtered blood into cortical peritubular capillaries or medullary vasa recta that supply and exchange with a folded tubular architecture. Hence the glomerular capillary tuft, fed and drained by arterioles, represents an arteriolar portal system. Fenestrated endothelial cells resting on a glomerular basement membrane (GBM) line glomerular capillaries. Delicate foot processes extending from epithelial podocytes shroud the outer surface of these capillaries, and podocytes interconnect to each other by slit-pore membranes forming a selective filtration barrier.

The glomerular capillaries filter 120每180 L/d of plasma water containing various solutes for reclamation or discharge by downstream tubules. Most large proteins and all cells are excluded from filtration by a physicochemical barrier governed by pore size and negative electrostatic charge. The mechanics of filtration and reclamation are quite complicated for many solutes (Chap. 271). For example, in the case of serum albumin, the glomerulus is an imperfect barrier. Although albumin has a negative charge, which would tend to repel the negatively charged GBM, it only has a physical radius of 3.6 nm, while pores in the GBM and slit-pore membranes have a radius of 4 nm. Consequently, variable amounts of albumin inevitably cross the filtration barrier to be reclaimed by megalin and cubilin receptors along the proximal tubule. Remarkably, humans with normal nephrons do not excrete more than 8每10 mg of albumin in daily voided urine, approximately 20每60% of total excreted protein. This amount of albumin, and other proteins, can rise to gram quantities following glomerular injury.

The breadth of diseases affecting the glomerulus is expansive because the glomerular capillaries can be injured in a variety of ways, producing many different lesions and several unique changes to urinalysis. Some order to this vast subject is brought by grouping all of these diseases into a smaller number of clinical syndromes.
 
Pathogenesis of Glomerular Disease

There are many forms of glomerular disease with pathogenesis variably linked to the presence of genetic mutations, infection, toxin exposure, autoimmunity, atherosclerosis, hypertension, emboli, thrombosis, or diabetes mellitus. Even after careful study, however, the cause often remains unknown, and the lesion is called idiopathic. Specific or unique features of pathogenesis are mentioned with the description of each of the glomerular diseases later in this chapter.

Some glomerular diseases result from genetic mutations producing familial disease or a founder effect: congenital nephrotic syndrome from mutations in NPHS1 (nephrin) and NPHS2 (podocin) affect the slit-pore membrane at birth, and TRPC6 cation channel mutations produce focal segmental glomerulosclerosis(FSGS) in adulthood; polymorphisms in the gene encoding apolipoprotein L1, APOL1 are a major risk for nearly 70% of African Americans with nondiabetic end-stage renal disease (ESRD), particularly FSGS; mutations in complement factor H associate with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis(MPGN) or atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), type II partial lipodystrophy from mutations in genes encoding lamin A/C, or PPAR cause a metabolic syndrome associated with MPGN, which is sometimes accompanied by dense deposits and C3 nephritic factor; Alport's syndrome, from mutations in the genes encoding for the 3, 4, or 5 chains of type IV collagen, produces split-basement membranes with glomerulosclerosis; and lysosomal storage diseases, such as -galactosidase A deficiency causing Fabry's disease and N-acetylneuraminic acid hydrolase deficiency causing nephrosialidosis, produce FSGS.

Systemic hypertension and atherosclerosis can produce pressure stress, ischemia, or lipid oxidants that lead to chronic glomerulosclerosis.Malignant hypertension can quickly complicate glomerulosclerosis with fibrinoid necrosis of arterioles and glomeruli, thrombotic microangiopathy, and acute renal failure. Diabetic nephropathy is an acquired sclerotic injury associated with thickening of the GBM secondary to the long-standing effects of hyperglycemia, advanced glycosylation end products, and reactive oxygen species.

Inflammation of the glomerular capillaries is called glomerulonephritis. Most glomerular or mesangial antigens involved in immune-mediated glomerulonephritis are unknown (Fig. 283-2). Glomerular epithelial or mesangial cells may shed or express epitopes that mimic other immunogenic proteins made elsewhere in the body. Bacteria, fungi, and viruses can directly infect the kidney producing their own antigens. Autoimmune diseases like idiopathic membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) or MPGN are confined to the kidney, while systemic inflammatory diseases like lupus nephritis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) spread to the kidney, causing secondary glomerular injury. Antiglomerular basement membrane disease producing Goodpasture's syndrome primarily injures both the lung and kidney because of the narrow distribution of the 3 NC1 domain of type IV collagen that is the target antigen.

The glomerulus is injured by a variety of mechanisms. A. Preformed immune deposits can precipitate from the circulation and collect along the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in the subendothelial space or can form in situ along the subepithelial space. B.Immunofluorescent staining of glomeruli with labeled anti-IgG demonstrating linear staining from a patient with anti-GBM disease or immune deposits from a patient with membranous glomerulonephritis. C. The mechanisms of glomerular injury have a complicated pathogenesis. Immune deposits and complement deposition classically draw macrophages and neutrophils into the glomerulus. T lymphocytes may follow to participate in the injury pattern as well. D. Amplification mediators as locally derived oxidants and proteases expand this inflammation, and, depending on the location of the target antigen and the genetic polymorphisms of the host, basement membranes are damaged with either endocapillary or extracapillary proliferation.
 
 

Local activation of Toll-like receptors on glomerular cells, deposition of immune complexes, or complement injury to glomerular structures induces mononuclear cell infiltration, which subsequently leads to an adaptive immune response attracted to the kidney by local release of chemokines. Neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells are drawn by chemokines into the glomerular tuft, where they react with antigens and epitopes on or near somatic cells or their structures, producing more cytokines and proteases that damage the mesangium, capillaries, and/or the GBM. While the adaptive immune response is similar to that of other tissues, early T cell activation plays an important role in the mechanism of glomerulonephritis. Antigens presented by class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on macrophages and dendritic cells in conjunction with associative recognition molecules engage the CD4/8 T cell repertoire.

Mononuclear cells by themselves can injure the kidney, but autoimmune events that damage glomeruli classically produce a humoral immune response. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis,lupus nephritis, and idiopathic membranous nephritis typically are associated with immune deposits along the GBM, while anti-GBM antibodies produce the linear binding of anti-GBM disease. Preformed circulating immune complexes can precipitate along the subendothelial side of the GBM, while other immune deposits form in situ on the subepithelial side. These latter deposits accumulate when circulating autoantibodies find their antigen trapped along the subepithelial edge of the GBM. Immune deposits in the glomerular mesangium may result from the deposition of preformed circulating complexes or in situ antigen-antibody interactions. Immune deposits stimulate the release of local proteases and activate the complement cascade, producing C5每9 attack complexes. In addition, local oxidants damage glomerular structures, producing proteinuria and effacement of the podocytes. Overlapping etiologies or pathophysiologic mechanisms can produce similar glomerular lesions, suggesting that downstream molecular and cellular responses often converge toward common patterns of injury.
 
Progression of Glomerular Disease

Persistent glomerulonephritis that worsens renal function is always accompanied by interstitial nephritis, renal fibrosis, and tubular atrophy (Fig. e14-27). What is not so obvious, however, is that renal failure in glomerulonephritis best correlates histologically with the appearance of tubulointerstitial nephritis rather than with the type of inciting glomerular injury.

Loss of renal function due to interstitial damage is explained hypothetically by several mechanisms. The simplest explanation is that urine flow is impeded by tubular obstruction as a result of interstitial inflammation and fibrosis. Thus, obstruction of the tubules with debris or by extrinsic compression results in aglomerular nephrons. A second mechanism suggests that interstitial changes, including interstitial edema or fibrosis, alter tubular and vascular architecture and thereby compromise the normal tubular transport of solutes and water from tubular lumen to vascular space. This failure increases the solute and water content of the tubule fluid, resulting in isosthenuria and polyuria. Adaptive mechanisms related to tubuloglomerular feedback also fail, resulting in a reduction of renin output from the juxtaglomerular apparatus trapped by interstitial inflammation. Consequently, the local vasoconstrictive influence of angiotensin II on the glomerular arterioles decreases, and filtration drops owing to a generalized decrease in arteriolar tone. A third mechanism involves changes in vascular resistance due to damage of peritubular capillaries. The cross-sectional volume of these capillaries is decreased by interstitial inflammation, edema, or fibrosis. These structural alterations in vascular resistance affect renal function through two mechanisms. First, tubular cells are very metabolically active, and, as a result, decreased perfusion leads to ischemic injury. Second, impairment of glomerular arteriolar outflow leads to increased intraglomerular hypertension in less-involved glomeruli; this selective intraglomerular hypertension aggravates and extends mesangial sclerosis and glomerulosclerosis to less-involved glomeruli. Regardless of the exact mechanism, early acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (Fig. e14-27) suggests potentially recoverable renal function, while the development of chronic interstitial fibrosis prognosticates permanent loss (Fig. e14-30).

Persistent damage to glomerular capillaries spreads to the tubulointerstitium in association with proteinuria. There is an untested hypothesis that efferent arterioles leading from inflamed glomeruli carry forward inflammatory mediators, which induces downstream interstitial nephritis, resulting in fibrosis. Glomerular filtrate from injured glomerular capillaries adherent to Bowman's capsule may also be misdirected to the periglomerular interstitium. Most nephrologists believe, however, that proteinuric glomerular filtrate forming tubular fluid is the primary route to downstream tubulointerstitial injury, although none of these hypotheses are mutually exclusive.

The simplest explanation for the effect of proteinuria on the development of interstitial nephritis is that increasingly severe proteinuria, carrying activated cytokines and lipoproteins producing reactive oxygen species, triggers a downstream inflammatory cascade in and around epithelial cells lining the tubular nephron. These effects induce T lymphocyte and macrophage infiltrates in the interstitial spaces along with fibrosis and tubular atrophy.

Tubules disaggregate following direct damage to their basement membranes, leading to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions forming more interstitial fibroblasts at the site of injury. Transforming growth factor  (TGF-), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), hypoxemia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) are particularly active in this transition. With persistent nephritis, fibroblasts multiply and lay down tenascin and a fibronectin scaffold for the polymerization of new interstitial collagen types I/III. These events form scar tissue through a process called fibrogenesis. In experimental studies, bone morphogenetic protein 7 and hepatocyte growth factor can reverse early fibrogenesis and preserve tubular architecture. When fibroblasts outdistance their survival factors, apoptoses occurs, and the permanent renal scar becomes acellular, leading to irreversible renal failure.

Approach to the Patient: Glomerular Disease

Hematuria, Proteinuria, and Pyuria

Patients with glomerular disease usually have some hematuria with varying degrees of proteinuria. Hematuria is typically asymptomatic. As few as three to five red blood cells in the spun sediment from first-voided morning urine is suspicious. The diagnosis of glomerular injury can be delayed because patients will not realize they have microscopic hematuria, and only rarely with the exception of IgA nephropathy and sickle cell disease is gross hematuria present. When working up microscopic hematuria, perhaps accompanied by minimal proteinuria (<500 mg/24 h), it is important to exclude anatomic lesions, such as malignancy of the urinary tract, particularly in older men. Microscopic hematuria may also appear with the onset of benign prostatic hypertrophy, interstitial nephritis, papillary necrosis, hypercalciuria, renal stones, cystic kidney diseases, or renal vascular injury. However, when red blood cell casts (Fig. e14-34) or dysmorphic red blood cells are found in the sediment, glomerulonephritis is likely.

Sustained proteinuria >1每2 g/24 h is also commonly associated with glomerular disease. Patients often will not know they have proteinuria unless they become edematous or notice foaming urine on voiding. Sustained proteinuria has to be distinguished from lesser amounts of so-called benign proteinuria in the normal population (Table 283-1). This latter class of proteinuria is nonsustained, generally <1 g/24 h, and is sometimes called functional or transient proteinuria. Fever, exercise, obesity, sleep apnea, emotional stress, and congestive heart failure can explain transient proteinuria. Proteinuria only seen with upright posture is called orthostatic proteinuria and has a benign prognosis. Isolated proteinuria sustained over multiple clinic visits is found in diabetic nephropathy, nil lesion, mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, and FSGS. Proteinuria in most adults with glomerular disease is nonselective, containing albumin and a mixture of other serum proteins, while in children with nil lesion from minimal change disease, the proteinuria is selective and composed largely of albumin.

Some patients with inflammatory glomerular disease, such as acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis or MPGN, have pyuria characterized by the presence of considerable numbers of leukocytes. This latter finding has to be distinguished from urine infected with bacteria.

Clinical Syndromes

Various forms of glomerular injury can also be parsed into several distinct syndromes on clinical grounds (Table 283-2). These syndromes, however, are not always mutually exclusive. There is an acute nephritic syndrome producing 1每2 g/24 h of proteinuria, hematuria with red blood cell casts, pyuria, hypertension, fluid retention, and a rise in serum creatinine associated with a reduction in glomerular filtration. If glomerular inflammation develops slowly, the serum creatinine will rise gradually over many weeks, but if the serum creatinine rises quickly, particularly over a few days, acute nephritis is sometimes called rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN); the histopathologic term crescentic glomerulonephritis is the pathologic equivalent of the clinical presentation of RPGN. When patients with RPGN present with lung hemorrhage from Goodpasture's syndrome, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated small-vessel vasculitis, lupus erythematosus, or cryoglobulinemia, they are often diagnosed as having a pulmonary-renal syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome describes the onset of heavy proteinuria (>3.0 g/24 h), hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hypoalbuminemia, edema/anasarca, and microscopic hematuria; if only large amounts of proteinuria are present without clinical manifestations, the condition is sometimes called nephrotic-range proteinuria. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in these patients may initially be normal or, rarely, higher than normal, but with persistent hyperfiltration and continued nephron loss, it typically declines over months to years. Patients with a basement membrane syndrome either have genetically abnormal basement membranes (Alport's syndrome) or an autoimmune response to basement membrane collagen IV (Goodpasture's syndrome) associated with microscopic hematuria, mild to heavy proteinuria, and hypertension with variable elevations in serum creatinine. Glomerular-vascular syndrome describes patients with vascular injury producing hematuria and moderate proteinuria. Affected individuals can have vasculitis, thrombotic microangiopathy, antiphospholipid syndrome, or, more commonly, a systemic disease such as atherosclerosis, cholesterol emboli, hypertension, sickle cell anemia, and autoimmunity. Infectious disease-associated syndrome is most important if one has an international perspective. Save for subacute bacterial endocarditis in the Western Hemisphere, malaria and schistosomiasis may be the most common causes of glomerulonephritis throughout the world, closely followed by HIV and chronic hepatitis B and C. These infectious diseases produce a variety of inflammatory reactions in glomerular capillaries, ranging from nephrotic syndrome to acute nephritic injury, and urinalyses that demonstrate a combination of hematuria and proteinuria.

These six general categories of syndromes are usually determined at the bedside with the help of a history and physical examination, blood chemistries, renal ultrasound, and urinalysis. These initial studies help frame further diagnostic workup that typically involves some testing of the serum for the presence of various proteins (HIV and hepatitis B and C antigens), antibodies [anti-GBM, antiphospholipid, antistreptolysin O (ASO), anti-DNAse, antihyaluronidase, ANCA, anti-DNA, cryoglobulins, anti-HIV, and anti-hepatitis B and C antibodies] or depletion of complement components (C3 and C4). The bedside history and physical examination can also help determine whether the glomerulonephritis is isolated to the kidney (primary glomerulonephritis) or is part of a systemic disease (secondary glomerulonephritis).

When confronted with an abnormal urinalysis and elevated serum creatinine, with or without edema or congestive heart failure, one must consider whether the glomerulonephritis is acute or chronic. This assessment is best made by careful history (last known urinalysis or serum creatinine during pregnancy or insurance physical, evidence of infection, or use of medication or recreational drugs); the size of the kidneys on renal ultrasound examination; and how the patient feels at presentation. Chronic glomerular disease often presents with decreased kidney size. Patients who quickly develop renal failure are fatigued and weak; feel miserable; often have uremic symptoms associated with nausea, vomiting, fluid retention, and somnolence. Primary glomerulonephritis presenting with renal failure that has progressed slowly, however, can be remarkably asymptomatic, as are patients with acute glomerulonephritis without much loss in renal function. Once this initial information is collected, selected patients who are clinically stable, have adequate blood clotting parameters, and are willing and able to receive treatment are encouraged to have a renal biopsy. Biopsies can be done safely with an ultrasound-guided biopsy gun.

Renal Pathology

A renal biopsy in the setting of glomerulonephritis quickly identifies the type of glomerular injury and often suggests a course of treatment. The biopsy is processed for light microscopy using stains for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to assess cellularity and architecture, periodic acid每Schiff (PAS) to stain carbohydrate moieties in the membranes of the glomerular tuft and tubules, Jones-methenamine silver to enhance basement membrane structure, Congo red for amyloid deposits, and Masson's trichrome to identify collagen deposition and assess the degree of glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. Biopsies are also processed for direct immunofluorescence using conjugated antibodies against IgG, IgM, and IgA to detect the presence of "lumpy-bumpy" immune deposits or "linear" IgG or IgA antibodies bound to GBM, antibodies against trapped complement proteins (C3 and C4), or specific antibodies against a relevant antigen. High-resolution electron microscopy can clarify the principal location of immune deposits and the status of the basement membrane.

Each region of a renal biopsy is assessed separately. By light microscopy, glomeruli (at least 10 and ideally 20) are reviewed individually for discrete lesions; <50% involvement is considered focal, and >50% is diffuse. Injury in each glomerular tuft can be segmental, involving a portion of the tuft, or global, involving most of the glomerulus. Glomeruli having proliferative characteristics show increased cellularity. When cells in the capillary tuft proliferate, it is called endocapillary, and when cellular proliferation extends into Bowman's space, it is called extracapillary.Synechiae are formed when epithelial podocytes attach to Bowman's capsule in the setting of glomerular injury; crescents, which in some cases may be the extension of synechiae, develop when fibrocellular/fibrin collections fill all or part of Bowman's space; and sclerotic glomeruli show acellular, amorphous accumulations of proteinaceous material throughout the tuft with loss of functional capillaries and normal mesangium. Since age-related glomerulosclerosis is common in adults, one can estimate the background percentage of sclerosis by dividing the patient's age in half and subtracting 10. Immunofluorescent and electron microscopy can detect the presence and location of subepithelial,subendothelial, or mesangial immune deposits, or reduplication or splitting of the basement membrane. In the other regions of the biopsy, the vasculature surrounding glomeruli and tubules can show angiopathy, vasculitis, the presence of fibrils, or thrombi. The tubules can be assessed for adjacency to one another; separation can be the result of edema, tubular dropout, or collagen deposition resulting from interstitial fibrosis. Interstitial fibrosis is an ominous sign of irreversibility and progression to renal failure.
 
Acute Nephritic Syndromes

Acute nephritic syndromes classically present with hypertension, hematuria, red blood cell casts, pyuria, and mild to moderate proteinuria. Extensive inflammatory damage to glomeruli causes a fall in GFR and eventually produces uremic symptoms with salt and water retention, leading to edema and hypertension.

Poststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis

Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is prototypical for acute endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis. The incidence of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis has dramatically decreased in developed countries and in these locations is typically sporadic; epidemics are less common. Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis in underdeveloped countries usually affects children between the ages of 2 and 14 years, but in developed countries is more typical in the elderly, especially in association with debilitating conditions. It is more common in males, and the familial or cohabitant incidence is as high as 40%. Skin and throat infections with particular M types of streptococci (nephritogenic strains) antedate glomerular disease; M types 47, 49, 55, 2, 60, and 57 are seen following impetigo and M types 1, 2, 4, 3, 25, 49, and 12 with pharyngitis. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis due to impetigo develops 2每6 weeks after skin infection and 1每3 weeks after streptococcal pharyngitis.

The renal biopsy in poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis demonstrates hypercellularity of mesangial and endothelial cells, glomerular infiltrates of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, granular subendothelial immune deposits of IgG, IgM, C3, C4, and C5-9, and subepithelial deposits (which appear as "humps") (Fig. e14-6). (See Glomerular Schematic 1.) Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is an immune-mediated disease involving putative streptococcal antigens, circulating immune complexes, and activation of complement in association with cell-mediated injury. Many candidate antigens have been proposed over the years; candidates from nephritogenic streptococci of interest at the moment are: a cationic cysteine proteinase known as streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SPEB) that is generated by proteolysis of a zymogen precursor (zSPEB) and, NAPlr, the nephritis-associated plasmin receptor. These two antigens have biochemical affinity for plasmin, bind as complexes facilitated by this relationship, and both activate the alternate complement pathway. The nephritogenic antigen, SPEB, has been demonstrated inside the subepithelial "humps" on biopsy.

The classic presentation is an acute nephritic picture with hematuria, pyuria, red blood cell casts, edema, hypertension, and oliguric renal failure, which may be severe enough to appear as RPGN. Systemic symptoms of headache, malaise, anorexia, and flank pain (due to swelling of the renal capsule) are reported in as many as 50% of cases. Five percent of children and 20% of adults have proteinuria in the nephrotic range. In the first week of symptoms, 90% of patients will have a depressed CH50 and decreased levels of C3 with normal levels of C4. Positive rheumatoid factor (30每40%), cryoglobulins and circulating immune complexes (60每70%), and ANCA against myeloperoxidase (10%) are also reported. Positive cultures for streptococcal infection are inconsistently present (10每70%), but increased titers of ASO (30%), anti-DNAse, (70%), or antihyaluronidase antibodies (40%) can help confirm the diagnosis. Consequently, the diagnosis of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis rarely requires a renal biopsy. A subclinical disease is reported in some series to be four to five times as common as clinical nephritis, and these latter cases are characterized by asymptomatic microscopic hematuria with low serum C3 complement levels.

Treatment is supportive, with control of hypertension, edema, and dialysis as needed. Antibiotic treatment for streptococcal infection should be given to all patients and their cohabitants. There is no role for immunosuppressive therapy, even in the setting of crescents. Recurrent poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is rare despite repeated streptococcal infections. Early death is rare in children but does occur in the elderly. Overall, the prognosis is good, with permanent renal failure being very uncommon, less than 1% in children. Complete resolution of the hematuria and proteinuria in the majority of children occurs within 3每6 weeks of the onset of nephritis but 3每10% of children may have persistent microscopic hematuria, non-nephrotic proteinuria, or hypertension. The prognosis in elderly patients is worse with a high incidence of azotemia (up to 60%), nephrotic-range proteinuria, and end-stage renal disease.

Subacute Bacterial Endocarditis

Endocarditis-associated glomerulonephritis is typically a complication of subacute bacterial endocarditis, particularly in patients who remain untreated for a long time, have negative blood cultures, or have right-sided endocarditis. Glomerulonephritis is unusual in acute bacterial endocarditis because it takes 10每14 days to develop immune complex每mediated injury, by which time the patient has been treated, often with emergent surgery. Grossly, the kidneys in subacute bacterial endocarditis have subcapsular hemorrhages with a "flea-bitten" appearance, and microscopy on renal biopsy reveals focal proliferation around foci of necrosis associated with abundant mesangial, subendothelial, and subepithelial immune deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3. Patients who present with a clinical picture of RPGN have crescents. Embolic infarcts or septic abscesses may also be present. The pathogenesis hinges on the renal deposition of circulating immune complexes in the kidney with complement activation. Patients present with gross or microscopic hematuria, pyuria, and mild proteinuria or, less commonly, RPGN with rapid loss of renal function. A normocytic anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hypocomplementemia, high titers of rheumatoid factor, type III cryoglobulins, and circulating immune complexes are often present. Levels of serum creatinine may be elevated at diagnosis, but with modern therapy there is little progression to chronic renal failure. Primary treatment is eradication of the infection with 4每6 weeks of antibiotics, and if accomplished expeditiously, the prognosis for renal recovery is good. ANCA-associated vasculitis sometimes accompanies or is confused with subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) and should be ruled out, as the treatment is different.

As variants of persistent bacterial infection in blood, glomerulonephritis can occur in patients with ventriculoatrial and ventriculoperitoneal shunts; pulmonary, intraabdominal, pelvic, or cutaneous infections; and infected vascular prostheses. The clinical presentation of these conditions is variable and includes proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, and acute renal failure. Blood cultures are usually positive and serum complement levels low, and there may be elevated levels of C-reactive proteins, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, and cryoglobulins. Renal lesions include membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (DPGN), or mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, sometimes leading to RPGN. Treatment focuses on eradicating the infection, with most patients treated as if they have endocarditis.

Lupus Nephritis

Lupus nephritis is a common and serious complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and most severe in African-American female adolescents. Thirty to fifty percent of patients will have clinical manifestations of renal disease at the time of diagnosis, and 60% of adults and 80% of children develop renal abnormalities at some point in the course of their disease. Lupus nephritis results from the deposition of circulating immune complexes, which activate the complement cascade leading to complement-mediated damage, leukocyte infiltration, activation of procoagulant factors, and release of various cytokines. In situ immune complex formation following glomerular binding of nuclear antigens, particularly necrotic nucleosomes, also plays a role in renal injury. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies may also trigger a thrombotic microangiopathy in a minority of patients.

The clinical manifestations, course of disease, and treatment of lupus nephritis are closely linked to renal pathology. The most common clinical sign of renal disease is proteinuria, but hematuria, hypertension, varying degrees of renal failure, and active urine sediment with red blood cell casts can all be present. Although significant renal pathology can be found on biopsy even in the absence of major abnormalities in the urinalysis, most nephrologists do not biopsy patients until the urinalysis is convincingly abnormal. The extrarenal manifestations of lupus are important in establishing a firm diagnosis of systemic lupus because, while serologic abnormalities are common in lupus nephritis, they are not diagnostic. Anti-dsDNA antibodies that fix complement correlate best with the presence of renal disease. Hypocomplementemia is common in patients with acute lupus nephritis (70每90%) and declining complement levels may herald a flare. Although urinary biomarkers of lupus nephritis are being identified to assist in predicting renal flares, renal biopsy is the only reliable method of identifying the morphologic variants of lupus nephritis.

The World Health Organization (WHO) workshop in 1974 first outlined several distinct patterns of lupus-related glomerular injury; these were modified in 1982. In 2004 the International Society of Nephrology in conjunction with the Renal Pathology Society again updated the classification. This latest version of lesions seen on biopsy (Table 283-3) best defines clinicopathologic correlations, provides valuable prognostic information, and forms the basis for modern treatment recommendations. Class I nephritis describes normal glomerular histology by any technique or normal light microscopy with minimal mesangial deposits on immunofluorescent or electron microscopy. Class II designates mesangial immune complexes with mesangial proliferation. Both class I and II lesions are typically associated with minimal renal manifestation and normal renal function; nephrotic syndrome is rare. Patients with lesions limited to the renal mesangium have an excellent prognosis and generally do not need therapy for their lupus nephritis.

The subject of lupus nephritis is presented under acute nephritic syndromes because of the aggressive and important proliferative lesions seen in class III每V renal disease. Class III describes focal lesions with proliferation or scarring, often involving only a segment of the glomerulus (Fig. e14-12). Class III lesions have the most varied course. Hypertension, an active urinary sediment, and proteinuria are common with nephrotic-range proteinuria in 25每33% of patients. Elevated serum creatinine is present in 25% of patients. Patients with mild proliferation involving a small percentage of glomeruli respond well to therapy with steroids alone, and fewer than 5% progress to renal failure over 5 years. Patients with more severe proliferation involving a greater percentage of glomeruli have a far worse prognosis and lower remission rates. Treatment of those patients is the same as that for class IV lesions. Most nephrologists believe that class III lesions are simply an early presentation of class IV disease. Others believe severe class III disease is a discrete lesion also requiring aggressive therapy. Class IV describes global, diffuse proliferative lesions involving the vast majority of glomeruli. Patients with class IV lesions commonly have high anti-DNA antibody titers, low serum complement, hematuria, red blood cell casts, proteinuria, hypertension, and decreased renal function; 50% of patients have nephrotic-range proteinuria. Patients with crescents on biopsy often have a rapidly progressive decline in renal function (Fig. e14-12). Without treatment, this aggressive lesion has the worst renal prognosis. However, if a remission〞defined as a return to near-normal renal function and proteinuria 330 mg/dL per day〞is achieved with treatment, renal outcomes are excellent. Current evidence suggests that inducing a remission with administration of high-dose steroids and either cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil for 2每6 months, followed by maintenance therapy with lower doses of steroids and mycophenolate mofetil, best balances the likelihood of successful remission with the side effects of therapy. There is no consensus on use of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone versus oral prednisone, monthly intravenous cyclophosphamide versus daily oral cyclophosphamide, or other immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, rituximab, or azathioprine. Nephrologists tend to avoid prolonged use of cyclophosphamide in patients of childbearing age without first banking eggs or sperm.

The class V lesion describes subepithelial immune deposits producing a membranous pattern; a subcategory of class V lesions is associated with proliferative lesions and is sometimes called mixed membranous and proliferative disease (Fig. e14-11); this category of injury is treated like class IV glomerulonephritis. Sixty percent of patients present with nephrotic syndrome or lesser amounts of proteinuria. Patients with lupus nephritis class V, like patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy, are predisposed to renal-vein thrombosis and other thrombotic complications. A minority of patients with class V will present with hypertension and renal dysfunction. There are conflicting data on the clinical course, prognosis, and appropriate therapy for patients with class V disease, which may reflect the heterogeneity of this group of patients. Patients with severe nephrotic syndrome, elevated serum creatinine, and a progressive course will probably benefit from therapy with steroids in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Therapy with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system also may attenuate the proteinuria. Antiphospholipid antibodies present in lupus may result in glomerular microthromboses and complicate the course in up to 20% of lupus nephritis patients. The renal prognosis is worse even with anticoagulant therapy.

Patients with any of the above lesions also can transform to another lesion; hence patients often require reevaluation, including repeat renal biopsy. Lupus patients with class VI lesions have greater than 90% sclerotic glomeruli and end-stage renal disease with interstitial fibrosis. As a group, approximately 20% of patients with lupus nephritis will reach end-stage disease, requiring dialysis or transplantation. Systemic lupus tends to become quiescent once there is renal failure, perhaps due to the immunosuppressant effects of uremia. Renal transplantation in renal failure from lupus, usually performed after approximately 6 months of inactive disease, results in allograft survival rates comparable to patients transplanted for other reasons.

Antiglomerular Basement Membrane Disease

Patients who develop autoantibodies directed against glomerular basement antigens frequently develop a glomerulonephritis termed antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease. When they present with lung hemorrhage and glomerulonephritis, they have a pulmonary-renal syndrome called Goodpasture's syndrome. The target epitopes for this autoimmune disease lie in the quaternary structure of 3 NC1 domain of collagen IV. MHC-restricted T cells initiate the autoantibody response because humans are not tolerant to the epitopes created by this quaternary structure. The epitopes are normally sequestered in the collagen IV hexamer and can be exposed by infection, smoking, oxidants, or solvents. Goodpasture's syndrome appears in two age groups: in young men in their late 20s and in men and women in their 60每70s. Disease in the younger age group is usually explosive, with hemoptysis, a sudden fall in hemoglobin, fever, dyspnea, and hematuria. Hemoptysis is largely confined to smokers, and those who present with lung hemorrhage as a group do better than older populations who have prolonged, asymptomatic renal injury; presentation with oliguria is often associated with a particularly bad outcome. The performance of an urgent kidney biopsy is important in suspected cases of Goodpasture's syndrome to confirm the diagnosis and assess prognosis. Renal biopsies typically show focal or segmental necrosis that later, with aggressive destruction of the capillaries by cellular proliferation, leads to crescent formation in Bowman's space (Fig. e14-14). As these lesions progress, there is concomitant interstitial nephritis with fibrosis and tubular atrophy. The presence of anti-GBM antibodies and complement is recognized on biopsy by linear immunofluorescent staining for IgG (rarely IgA). In testing serum for anti-GBM antibodies, it is particularly important that the 3 NC1 domain of collagen IV alone be used as the target. This is because nonnephritic antibodies against the 1 NC1 domain are seen in paraneoplastic syndromes and cannot be discerned from assays that use whole basement membrane fragments as the binding target. Between 10 and 15% of sera from patients with Goodpasture's syndrome also contain ANCA antibodies against myeloperoxidase. This subset of patients has a vasculitis-associated variant, which has a surprisingly good prognosis with treatment. Prognosis at presentation is worse if there are >50% crescents on renal biopsy with advanced fibrosis, if serum creatinine is >5每6 mg/dL, if oliguria is present, or if there is a need for acute dialysis. Although frequently attempted, most of these latter patients will not respond to plasmapheresis and steroids. Patients with advanced renal failure who present with hemoptysis should still be treated for their lung hemorrhage, as it responds to plasmapheresis and can be lifesaving. Treated patients with less severe disease typically respond to 8每10 treatments of plasmapheresis accompanied by oral prednisone and cyclophosphamide in the first 2 weeks. Kidney transplantation is possible, but because there is risk of recurrence, experience suggests that patients should wait for 6 months and until serum antibodies are undetectable.

IgA Nephropathy

Berger first described the glomerulonephritis now termed IgA nephropathy. It is classically characterized by episodichematuria associated with the deposition of IgA in the mesangium. IgA nephropathy is one of the most common forms of glomerulonephritis worldwide. There is a male preponderance, a peak incidence in the second and third decades of life, and rare familial clustering. There are geographic differences in the prevalence of IgA nephropathy, with 30% prevalence along the Asian and Pacific Rim and 20% in southern Europe, compared to a much lower prevalence in northern Europe and North America. It was initially hypothesized that variation in detection, in part, accounted for regional differences. With clinical care in nephrology becoming more uniform, this variation in prevalence more likely reflects true differences among racial and ethnic groups.

IgA nephropathy is predominantly a sporadic disease but susceptibility to it has been shown uncommonly to have a genetic component depending on geography and the existence of "founder effects." Familial forms of IgA nephropathy are more common in northern Italy and eastern Kentucky. No single causal gene has been identified. Clinical and laboratory evidence suggests close similarities between Henoch-Sch?nlein purpura and IgA nephropathy. Henoch-Sch?nlein purpura is distinguished clinically from IgA nephropathy by prominent systemic symptoms, a younger age (<20 years old), preceding infection, and abdominal complaints. Deposits of IgA are also found in the glomerular mesangium in a variety of systemic diseases, including chronic liver disease, Crohn's disease, gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma, chronic bronchiectasis, idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, dermatitis herpetiformis, mycosis fungoides, leprosy, ankylosing spondylitis, relapsing polychondritis, and Sj?gren's syndrome. IgA deposition in these entities is not usually associated with clinically significant glomerular inflammation or renal dysfunction and thus is not called IgA nephropathy.

IgA nephropathy is an immune complex每mediated glomerulonephritis defined by the presence of diffuse mesangial IgA deposits often associated with mesangial hypercellularity. (See Glomerular Schematic 2.) IgM, IgG, C3, or immunoglobulin light chains may be codistributed with IgA. IgA deposited in the mesangium is typically polymeric and of the IgA1 subclass, the pathogenic significance of which is not clear. Abnormalities have been described in IgA production by plasma cells, particularly secretory IgA; in IgA clearance, predominately by the liver; in mesangial IgA clearance and receptors for IgA; and in growth factor and cytokine-mediated events. Currently, however, abnormalities in the O-glycosylation of the hinge region of IgA seem to best account for the pathogenesis of sporadic IgA nephropathy. Despite the presence of elevated serum IgA levels in 20每50% of patients, IgA deposition in skin biopsies in 15每55% of patients, or elevated levels of secretory IgA and IgA-fibronectin complexes, a renal biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Although the immunofluorescent pattern of IgA on renal biopsy defines IgA nephropathy in the proper clinical context, a variety of histologic lesions may be seen on light microscopy (Fig. e14-8), including DPGN; segmental sclerosis; and, rarely, segmental necrosis with cellular crescent formation, which typically presents as RPGN.

The two most common presentations of IgA nephropathy are recurrent episodes of macroscopic hematuria during or immediately following an upper respiratory infection often accompanied by proteinuria or persistent asymptomatic microscopic hematuria. Nephrotic syndrome, however, is uncommon. Proteinuria can also first appear late in the course of the disease. Rarely patients present with acute renal failure and a rapidly progressive clinical picture. IgA nephropathy is a benign disease for the majority of patients, and 5每30% of patients may go into a complete remission, with others having hematuria but well preserved renal function. In the minority of patients who have progressive disease, progression is slow, with renal failure seen in only 25每30% of patients with IgA nephropathy over 20每25 years. This risk varies considerably among populations. Cumulatively, risk factors for the loss of renal function identified thus far account for less than 50% of the variation in observed outcome but include the presence of hypertension or proteinuria, the absence of episodes of macroscopic hematuria, male age, older age of onset, and extensive glomerulosclerosis or interstitial fibrosis on renal biopsy. Several analyses in large populations of patients found persistent proteinuria for 6 months or longer to have the greatest predictive power for adverse renal outcomes.

There is no agreement on optimal treatment. Both large studies that include patients with multiple glomerular diseases and small studies of patients with IgA nephropathy support the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with proteinuria or declining renal function. Tonsillectomy, steroid therapy, and fish oil have all been suggested in small studies to benefit select patients with IgA nephropathy. When presenting as RPGN, patients typically receive steroids, cytotoxic agents, and plasmapheresis.

ANCA Small-Vessel Vasculitis

A group of patients with small-vessel vasculitis (arterioles, capillaries, and venules; rarely small arteries) and glomerulonephritis have serum ANCA; the antibodies are of two types, anti-proteinase 3 (PR3) or anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) (Chap. 326); Lamp-2 antibodies have also been reported experimentally as potentially pathogenic. ANCA are produced with the help of T cells and activate leukocytes and monocytes, which together damage the walls of small vessels. Endothelial injury also attracts more leukocytes and extends the inflammation. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's), microscopic polyangiitis, and Churg-Strauss syndrome belong to this group because they are ANCA-positive and have a pauci-immune glomerulonephritis with few immune complexes in small vessels and glomerular capillaries. Patients with any of these three diseases can have any combination of the above serum antibodies, but anti-PR3 antibodies are more common in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) and anti-MPO antibodies are more common in microscopic polyangiitis or Churg-Strauss. While each of these diseases have some unique clinical features, most features do not predict relapse or progression, and as a group they are generally treated in the same way. Since mortality is high without treatment, virtually all patients receive urgent treatment. Induction therapy usually includes some combination of plasmapheresis, methylprednisolone, and cyclophosphamide. The benefit of plasmapheresis in this setting is uncertain. Monthly "pulse" IV cyclophosphamide to induce remission of ANCA-associated vasculitis is as effective as daily oral cyclophosphamide and results in reduced cumulative adverse events but may be associated with increased relapses. Steroids are tapered soon after acute inflammation subsides, and patients are maintained on cyclophosphamide or azathioprine for up to a year to minimize the risk of relapse.

Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener's)

Patients with this disease classically present with fever, purulent rhinorrhea, nasal ulcers, sinus pain, polyarthralgias/arthritis, cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, microscopic hematuria, and 0.5每1 g/24 h of proteinuria; occasionally there may be cutaneous purpura and mononeuritis multiplex. Presentation without renal involvement is termed limited granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's), although some of these patients will show signs of renal injury later. Chest x-ray often reveals nodules and persistent infiltrates, sometimes with cavities. Biopsy of involved tissue will show a small-vessel vasculitis and adjacent noncaseating granulomas. Renal biopsies during active disease demonstrate segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis without immune deposits (Fig. e14-13). The cause of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) is unknown. In case-controlled studies there is greater risk associated with exposure to silica dust. The disease is also more common in patients with 1-antitrypsin deficiency, which is an inhibitor of PR3. Relapse after achieving remission is more common in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) than the other ANCA-associated vasculitis, necessitating diligent follow-up care.

Microscopic Polyangiitis

Clinically, these patients look somewhat similar to those with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's), except they rarely have significant lung disease or destructive sinusitis. The distinction is made on biopsy, where the vasculitis in microscopic polyangiitis is without granulomas. Some patients will also have injury limited to the capillaries and venules.

Churg-Strauss Syndrome

When small-vessel vasculitis is associated with peripheral eosinophilia, cutaneous purpura, mononeuritis, asthma, and allergic rhinitis, a diagnosis of Churg-Strauss syndrome is considered. Hypergammaglobulinemia, elevated levels of serum IgE, or the presence of rheumatoid factor sometimes accompanies the allergic state. Lung inflammation, including fleeting cough and pulmonary infiltrates, often precedes the systemic manifestations of disease by years; lung manifestations are rarely absent. A third of patients may have exudative pleural effusions associated with eosinophils. Small-vessel vasculitis and focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis can be seen on renal biopsy, usually absent eosinophils or granulomas. The cause of Churg-Strauss syndrome is autoimmune, but the inciting factors are unknown. Interestingly, some asthma patients treated with leukotriene receptor antagonists will develop this vasculitis.

Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis

MPGN is sometimes called mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis or lobar glomerulonephritis. It is an immune-mediated glomerulonephritis characterized by thickening of the GBM with mesangioproliferative changes; 70% of patients have hypocomplementemia. MPGN is rare in African Americans, and idiopathic disease usually presents in childhood or young adulthood. MPGN is subdivided pathologically into type I, type II, and type III disease. Type I MPGN is commonly associated with persistent hepatitis C infections, autoimmune diseases like lupus or cryoglobulinemia, or neoplastic diseases (Table 283-4). Types II and III MPGN are usually idiopathic, except in patients with complement factor H deficiency, in the presence of C3 nephritic factor and/or in partial lipodystrophy producing type II disease, or complement receptor deficiency in type III disease.

Type I MPGN, the most proliferative of the three types, shows mesangial proliferation with lobular segmentation on renal biopsy and mesangial interposition between the capillary basement membrane and endothelial cells, producing a double contour sometimes called tram-tracking (Fig. e14-9). (See Glomerular Schematic 3.) Subendothelial deposits with low serum levels of C3 are typical, although 50% of patients have normal levels of C3 and occasional intramesangial deposits. Low serum C3 and a dense thickening of the GBM containing ribbons of dense deposits and C3 characterize type II MPGN, sometimes called dense deposit disease (Fig. e14-10). Classically, the glomerular tuft has a lobular appearance; intramesangial deposits are rarely present and subendothelial deposits are generally absent. Proliferation in type III MPGN is less common than the other two types and is often focal; mesangial interposition is rare, and subepithelial deposits can occur along widened segments of the GBM that appear laminated and disrupted.

Type I MPGN is secondary to glomerular deposition of circulating immune complexes or their in situ formation. Types II and III MPGN may be related to "nephritic factors," which are autoantibodies that stabilize C3 convertase and allow it to activate serum C3. Patients with MPGN present with proteinuria, hematuria, and pyuria (30%), systemic symptoms of fatigue and malaise that are most common in children with type I disease, or an acute nephritic picture with RPGN and a speedy deterioration in renal function in up to 25% of patients. Low serum C3 levels are common. Fifty percent of patients with MPGN develop end-stage disease 10 years after diagnosis, and 90% have renal insufficiency after 20 years. Nephrotic syndrome, hypertension, and renal insufficiency all predict poor outcome. In the presence of proteinuria, treatment with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system is prudent. Evidence for treatment with dipyridamole, Coumadin (warfarin), or cyclophosphamide is not strongly established. There is some evidence supporting the efficacy of treatment of primary MPGN with steroids, particularly in children, as well as reports of efficacy with plasma exchange and other immunosuppressive drugs. In secondary MPGN, treating the associated infection, autoimmune disease, or neoplasms is of demonstrated benefit. In particular, pegylated interferon and ribavirin are useful in reducing viral load. Although all primary renal diseases can recur over time in transplanted renal allografts, patients with MPGN are well known to be at risk for not only a histologic recurrence but also a clinically significant recurrence with loss of graft function.

Mesangioproliferative Glomerulonephritis

Mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis is characterized by expansion of the mesangium, sometimes associated with mesangial hypercellularity; thin, single contoured capillary walls; and mesangial immune deposits. Clinically, it can present with varying degrees of proteinuria and, commonly, hematuria. Mesangioproliferative disease may be seen in IgA nephropathy, Plasmodium falciparum malaria, resolving postinfectious glomerulonephritis, and class II nephritis from lupus, all of which can have a similar histologic appearance. With these secondary entities excluded, the diagnosis of primary mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis is made in less than 15% of renal biopsies. As an immune-mediated renal lesion with deposits of IgM, C1q, and C3, the clinical course is variable. Patients with isolated hematuria may have a very benign course, and those with heavy proteinuria occasionally progress to renal failure. There is little agreement on treatment, but some clinical reports suggest benefit from use of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, steroid therapy, and even cytotoxic agents.
 
Nephrotic Syndrome

Nephrotic syndrome classically presents with heavy proteinuria, minimal hematuria, hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia, edema, and hypertension. If left undiagnosed or untreated, some of these syndromes will progressively damage enough glomeruli to cause a fall in GFR, producing renal failure.

Therapies for various causes of nephrotic syndrome are noted under individual disease headings below. In general, all patients with hypercholesterolemia secondary to nephrotic syndrome should be treated with lipid-lowering agents because they are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Edema secondary to salt and water retention can be controlled with the judicious use of diuretics, avoiding intravascular volume depletion. Venous complications secondary to the hypercoagulable state associated with nephrotic syndrome can be treated with anticoagulants. The losses of various serum binding proteins, such as thyroid-binding globulin, lead to alterations in functional tests. Lastly, proteinuria itself is hypothesized to be nephrotoxic, and treatment of proteinuria with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system can lower urinary protein excretion.

Minimal Change Disease

Minimal change disease (MCD), sometimes known as nil lesion, causes 70每90% of nephrotic syndrome in childhood but only 10每15% of nephrotic syndrome in adults. Minimal change disease usually presents as a primary renal disease but can be associated with several other conditions, including Hodgkin's disease, allergies, or use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents; significant interstitial nephritis often accompanies cases associated with nonsteroidal use. Minimal change disease on renal biopsy shows no obvious glomerular lesion by light microscopy and is negative for deposits by immunofluorescent microscopy, or occasionally shows small amounts of IgM in the mesangium (Fig. e14-1). (See Glomerular Schematic 4.) Electron microscopy, however, consistently demonstrates an effacement of the foot process supporting the epithelial podocytes with weakening of slit-pore membranes. The pathophysiology of this lesion is uncertain. Most agree there is a circulating cytokine, perhaps related to a T cell response that alters capillary charge and podocyte integrity. The evidence for cytokine-related immune injury is circumstantial and is suggested by the presence of preceding allergies, altered cell-mediated immunity during viral infections, and the high frequency of remissions with steroids.

Minimal change disease presents clinically with the abrupt onset of edema and nephrotic syndrome accompanied by acellular urinary sediment. Average urine protein excretion reported in 24 hours is 10 grams with severe hypoalbuminemia. Less common clinical features include hypertension (30% in children, 50% in adults), microscopic hematuria (20% in children, 33% in adults), atopy or allergic symptoms (40% in children, 30% in adults), and decreased renal function (<5% in children, 30% in adults). The appearance of acute renal failure in adults is often seen more commonly in patients with low serum albumin and intrarenal edema (nephrosarca) that is responsive to intravenous albumin and diuretics. This presentation must be distinguished from acute renal failure secondary to hypovolemia. Acute tubular necrosis and interstitial inflammation is also reported. In children, the abnormal urine principally contains albumin with minimal amounts of higher-molecular-weight proteins, and is sometimes called selective proteinuria. Although up to 30% of children have a spontaneous remission, all children today are treated with steroids; only children who are nonresponders are biopsied in this setting. Primary responders are patients who have a complete remission (<0.2 mg/24 h of proteinuria) after a single course of prednisone; steroid-dependent patients relapse as their steroid dose is tapered. Frequent relapsers have two or more relapses in the 6 months following taper, and steroid-resistant patients fail to respond to steroid therapy. Adults are not considered steroid-resistant until after 4 months of therapy. Ninety to 95% of children will develop a complete remission after 8 weeks of steroid therapy, and 80每85% of adults will achieve complete remission, but only after a longer course of 20每24 weeks. Patients with steroid resistance may have FSGS on repeat biopsy. Some hypothesize that if the first renal biopsy does not have a sample of deeper corticomedullary glomeruli, then the correct early diagnosis of FSGS may be missed.

Relapses occur in 70每75% of children after the first remission, and early relapse predicts multiple subsequent relapses. The frequency of relapses decreases after puberty, although there is an increased risk of relapse following the rapid tapering of steroids in all groups. Relapses are less common in adults but are more resistant to subsequent therapy. Prednisone is first-line therapy, either given daily or on alternate days. Other immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, and mycophenolate mofetil, are saved for frequent relapsers, steroid-dependent, or steroid-resistant patients. Cyclosporine can induce remission, but relapse is also common when cyclosporine is withdrawn. The long-term prognosis in adults is less favorable when acute renal failure or steroid resistance occurs.

Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) refers to a pattern of renal injury characterized by segmental glomerular scars that involve some but not all glomeruli; the clinical findings of FSGS largely manifest as proteinuria. When the secondary causes of FSGS are eliminated (Table 283-5), the remaining patients are considered to have primary FSGS. The incidence of this disease is increasing, and it now represents up to one-third of cases of nephrotic syndrome in adults and one-half of cases of nephrotic syndrome in African Americans, in whom it is seen more commonly. The pathogenesis of FSGS is probably multifactorial. Possible mechanisms include a T cell每mediated circulating permeability factor, TGF-每mediated cellular proliferation and matrix synthesis, and podocyte abnormalities associated with genetic mutations. Risk polymorphisms at the APOL1 locus encoding apolipoprotein L1 expressed in podocytes substantially explain the increased burden of FSGS among African Americans with or without HIV-associated disease.

The pathologic changes of FSGS are most prominent in glomeruli located at the corticomedullary junction (Fig. e14-2), so if the renal biopsy specimen is from superficial tissue, the lesions can be missed, which sometimes leads to a misdiagnosis of MCD. In addition to focal and segmental scarring, other variants have been described, including cellular lesions with endocapillary hypercellularity and heavy proteinuria; collapsing glomerulopathy (Fig. e14-3) with segmental or global glomerular collapse and a rapid decline in renal function; a hilar stalk lesion (Fig. e14-4) or the glomerular tip lesion(Fig. e14-5), which may have a better prognosis. (See Glomerular Schematic 5.)

FSGS can present with hematuria, hypertension, any level of proteinuria or renal insufficiency. Nephrotic-range proteinuria, African-American race, and renal insufficiency are associated with a poor outcome, with 50% of patients reaching renal failure in 6每8 years. FSGS rarely remits spontaneously, but treatment-induced remission of proteinuria significantly improves prognosis. Treatment of patients with primary FSGS should include inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system. Based on retrospective studies, patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria can be treated with steroids but respond far less often and after a longer course of therapy than patients with MCD. Proteinuria remits in only 20每45% of patients receiving a course of steroids over 6每9 months. Limited evidence suggests the use of cyclosporine in steroid-responsive patients helps ensure remissions. Relapse frequently occurs after cessation of cyclosporine therapy, and cyclosporine itself can lead to a deterioration of renal function due to its nephrotoxic effects. A role for other agents that suppress the immune system has not been established. Primary FSGS recurs in 25每40% of patients given allografts at end-stage disease, leading to graft loss in half of those cases. The treatment of secondary FSGS typically involves treating the underlying cause and controlling proteinuria. There is no role for steroids or other immunosuppressive agents in secondary FSGS.

Membranous Glomerulonephritis

Membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN), or membranous nephropathy as it is sometimes called, accounts for approximately 30% of cases of nephrotic syndrome in adults, with a peak incidence between the ages of 30 and 50 years and a male to female ratio of 2:1. It is rare in childhood and the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in the elderly. In 25每30% of cases, MGN is associated with a malignancy (solid tumors of the breast, lung, colon), infection (hepatitis B, malaria, schistosomiasis), or rheumatologic disorders like lupus or rarely rheumatoid arthritis (Table 283-6).

Uniform thickening of the basement membrane along the peripheral capillary loops is seen by light microscopy on renal biopsy (Fig. e14-7); this thickening needs to be distinguished from that seen in diabetes and amyloidosis. (See Glomerular Schematic 6.) Immunofluorescence demonstrates diffuse granular deposits of IgG and C3, and electron microscopy typically reveals electron-dense subepithelial deposits. While different stages (I每V) of progressive membranous lesions have been described, some published analyses indicate the degree of tubular atrophy or interstitial fibrosis is more predictive of progression than is the stage of glomerular disease. The presence of subendothelial deposits or the presence of tubuloreticular inclusions strongly points to a diagnosis of membranous lupus nephritis, which may precede the extrarenal manifestations of lupus. Work in Heyman nephritis, an animal model of MGN, suggests that glomerular lesions result from in situ formation of immune complexes with megalin receptor每associated protein as the putative antigen. This antigen is not found in human podocytes, but human antibodies have been described against neutral endopeptidase expressed by podocytes, hepatitis antigens B/C, Helicobacterpylori antigens, and tumor antigens. In a newer study, autoantibodies against the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) circulate and bind to a conformational epitope present in the receptor on human podocytes, producing in situ deposits characteristic of idiopathic membranous nephropathy. Other renal diseases and secondary membranous nephropathy do not appear to involve such autoantibodies. Eighty percent of patients with MGN present with nephrotic syndrome and nonselective proteinuria. Microscopic hematuria is seen in up to 50% of patients but is seen less commonly than in IgA nephropathy or FSGS. Spontaneous remissions occur in 20每33% of patients and often occur late in the course after years of nephrotic syndrome, which make treatment decisions difficult. One-third of patients continue to have relapsing nephrotic syndrome but maintain normal renal function, and approximately another third of patients develop renal failure or die from the complications of nephrotic syndrome. Male gender, older age, hypertension, and the persistence of proteinuria are associated with worse prognosis. Although thrombotic complications are a feature of all nephrotic syndromes, MGN has the highest reported incidences of renal vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis. Prophylactic anticoagulation is controversial but has been recommended for patients with severe or prolonged proteinuria in the absence of risk factors for bleeding.

In addition to the treatment of edema, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system is recommended. Therapy with immunosuppressive drugs is also recommended for patients with primary MGN and persistent proteinuria (>3.0 g/24 h). The choice of immunosuppressive drugs for therapy is controversial, but current recommendations based on small clinical studies are to treat with steroids and cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, mycophenolate mofetil, or cyclosporine. In patients who relapse or fail to respond to this therapy there are case reports of beneficial effects with the use of rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody directed at B cells, or with synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone.

Diabetic Nephropathy

Diabetic nephropathy is the single most common cause of chronic renal failure in the United States, accounting for 45% of patients receiving renal replacement therapy, and is a rapidly growing problem worldwide. The dramatic increase in the number of patients with diabetic nephropathy reflects the epidemic increase in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Approximately 40% of patients with types 1 or 2 diabetes develop nephropathy, but due to the higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes (90%) compared to type 1 (10%), the majority of patients with diabetic nephropathy have type 2 disease. Renal lesions are more common in African-American, Native American, Polynesian, and Maori populations. Risk factors for the development of diabetic nephropathy include hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, a family history of diabetic nephropathy, and genepolymorphisms affecting the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis.

Within 1每2 years after the onset of clinical diabetes, morphologic changes appear in the kidney. Thickening of the GBM is a sensitive indicator for the presence of diabetes but correlates poorly with the presence or absence of clinically significant nephropathy. The composition of the GBM is altered notably with a loss of heparan sulfate moieties that form the negatively charged filtration barrier. This change results in increased filtration of serum proteins into the urine, predominately negatively charged albumin. The expansion of the mesangium due to the accumulation of extracellular matrix correlates with the clinical manifestations of diabetic nephropathy (see stages in Fig. e14-20). This expansion in mesangial matrix is associated with the development of mesangial sclerosis. Some patients also develop eosinophilic, PAS+ nodules called nodular glomerulosclerosis or Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules. Immunofluorescence microscopy often reveals the nonspecific deposition of IgG (at times in a linear pattern) or complement staining without immune deposits on electron microscopy. Prominent vascular changes are frequently seen with hyaline and hypertensive arteriosclerosis. This is associated with varying degrees of chronic glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial changes. Renal biopsies from patients with types 1 and 2 diabetes are largely indistinguishable.

These pathologic changes are the result of a number of postulated factors. Multiple lines of evidence support an important role for increases in glomerular capillary pressure (intraglomerular hypertension) in alterations in renal structure and function. Direct effects of hyperglycemia on the actin cytoskeleton of renal mesangial and vascular smooth-muscle cells as well as diabetes-associated changes in circulating factors such as atrial natriuretic factor, angiotensin II, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) may account for this. Sustained glomerular hypertension increases matrix production, alterations in the GBM with disruption in the filtration barrier (and hence proteinuria), and glomerulosclerosis. A number of factors have also been identified that alter matrix production, including the accumulation of advanced glycosylation end products, circulating factors including growth hormone, IGF-I, angiotensin II, connective tissue growth factor, TGF-, and dyslipidemia.

The natural history of diabetic nephropathy in patients with types 1 and 2 diabetes is similar. However, since the onset of Type 1 diabetes is readily identifiable and the onset of type 2 diabetes is not, a patient newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes may have renal disease for many years before nephropathy is discovered and presents as advanceddiabetic nephropathy. At the onset of diabetes, renal hypertrophy and glomerular hyperfiltration are present. The degree of glomerular hyperfiltration correlates with the subsequent risk of clinically significant nephropathy. In the approximately 40% of patients with diabetes who develop diabetic nephropathy, the earliest manifestation is an increase in albuminuria detected by sensitive radioimmunoassay (Table 283-1). Albuminuria in the range of 30每300 mg/24 h is called microalbuminuria. In patients with types 1 or 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria appears 5每10 years after the onset of diabetes. It is currently recommended to test patients with type 1 disease for microalbuminuria 5 years after diagnosis of diabetes and yearly thereafter, and, because the time of onset of type 2 diabetes is often unknown, to test type 2 patients at the time of diagnosis of diabetes and yearly thereafter.

Patients with small rises in albuminuria increase their levels of urinary albumin excretion, typically reaching dipstick positive levels of proteinuria (>300 mg albuminuria) 5每10 years after the onset of early albuminuria. Microalbuminuria is a potent risk factor for cardiovascular events and death in patients with type 2 diabetes. Many patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria succumb to cardiovascular events before they progress to proteinuria or renal failure. Proteinuria in frank diabetic nephropathy can be variable, ranging from 500 mg to 25 g/24 h, and is often associated with nephrotic syndrome. More than 90% of patients with type 1 diabetes and nephropathy have diabetic retinopathy, so the absence of retinopathy in type 1 patients with proteinuria should prompt consideration of a diagnosis other than diabetic nephropathy; only 60% of patients with type 2 diabetes with nephropathy have diabetic retinopathy. There is a highly significant correlation between the presence of retinopathy and the presence of Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules (Fig. e14-20). Also, characteristically, patients with advanced diabetic nephropathy have normal to enlarged kidneys, in contrast to other glomerular diseases where kidney size is usually decreased. Using the above epidemiologic and clinical data, and in the absence of other clinical or serologic data suggesting another disease, diabetic nephropathy is usually diagnosed without a renal biopsy. After the onset of proteinuria, renal function inexorably declines, with 50% of patients reaching renal failure over another 5每10 years; thus, from the earliest stages of microalbuminuria, it usually takes 10每20 years to reach end-stage renal disease. Hypertension may predict which patients develop diabetic nephropathy, as the presence of hypertension accelerates the rate of decline in renal function. Once renal failure appears, however, survival on dialysis is far shorter for patients with diabetes compared to other dialysis patients. Survival is best for patients with type 1 diabetes who receive a transplant from a living related donor.

Good evidence supports the benefits of blood sugar and blood pressure control as well as inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system in retarding the progression of diabetic nephropathy. In patients with type 1 diabetes, intensive control of blood sugar clearly prevents the development or progression of diabetic nephropathy. The evidence for benefit of intensive blood glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes is less certain, with current studies reporting conflicting results. Some, but not all, trials have reported increased mortality rate associated with intensive blood glucose control and the safety of HgbA1C goals less than 7% in patients with type 2 diabetes is currently unclear.

Controlling systemic blood pressure decreases renal and cardiovascular adverse events in this high-risk population. The vast majority of patients with diabetic nephropathy require three or more antihypertensive drugs to achieve this goal. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system, independent of their effects on systemic blood pressure, have been shown in numerous large clinical trials to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy at early (microalbuminuria) and late (proteinuria with reduced glomerular filtration) stages, independent of any effect they may have on systemic blood pressure. Since angiotensin II increases efferent arteriolar resistance and, hence, glomerular capillary pressure, one key mechanism for the efficacy of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) is reducing glomerular hypertension. Patients with type 1 diabetes for 5 years, who develop albuminuria or declining renal function should be treated with ACE inhibitors. Patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria or proteinuria may be treated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Less compelling evidence supports therapy with a combination of two drugs (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, renin inhibitors, or aldosterone antagonists) that suppress several components of the renin-angiotensin system.

Glomerular Deposition Diseases

Plasma cell dyscrasias producing excess light chain immunoglobulin sometimes lead to the formation of glomerular and tubular deposits that cause heavy proteinuria and renal failure; the same is true for the accumulation of serum amyloid A protein fragments seen in several inflammatory diseases. This broad group of proteinuric patients has glomerular deposition disease.

Light Chain Deposition Disease

The biochemical characteristics of nephrotoxic light chains produced in patients with light chain malignancies often confer a specific pattern of renal injury; that of either cast nephropathy (Fig. e14-17), which causes renal failure but not heavy proteinuria or amyloidosis, or light chain deposition disease (Fig. e14-16), which produces nephrotic syndrome with renal failure. These latter patients produce kappa light chains that do not have the biochemical features necessary to form amyloid fibrils. Instead, they self-aggregate and form granular deposits along the glomerular capillary and mesangium, tubular basement membrane, and Bowman's capsule. When predominant in glomeruli, nephrotic syndrome develops, and about 70% of patients progress to dialysis. Light-chain deposits are not fibrillar and do not stain with Congo red, but they are easily detected with anti每light chain antibody using immunofluorescence or as granular deposits on electron microscopy. A combination of the light chain rearrangement, self-aggregating properties at neutral pH, and abnormal metabolism probably contribute to the deposition. Treatment for light chain deposition disease is treatment of the primary disease. As so many patients with light chain deposition disease progress to renal failure, the overall prognosis is grim.

Renal Amyloidosis

Most renal amyloidosis is either the result of primary fibrillar deposits of immunoglobulin light chains known as amyloid L (AL), or secondary to fibrillar deposits of serum amyloid A (AA) protein fragments (Chap. 112). Even though both occur for different reasons, their clinicopathophysiology is quite similar and will be discussed together. Amyloid infiltrates the liver, heart, peripheral nerves, carpal tunnel, upper pharynx, and kidney, producing restrictive cardiomyopathy, hepatomegaly, macroglossia, and heavy proteinuria sometimes associated with renal vein thrombosis. In systemic AL amyloidosis, also called primary amyloidosis, light chains produced in excess by clonal plasma cell dyscrasias are made into fragments by macrophages so they can self-aggregate at acid pH. A disproportionate number of these light chains (75%) are of the lambda class. About 10% of these patients have overt myeloma with lytic bone lesions and infiltration of the bone marrow with >30% plasma cells; nephrotic syndrome is common, and about 20% of patients progress to dialysis. AA amyloidosis is sometimes called secondary amyloidosis and also presents as nephrotic syndrome. It is due to deposition of -pleated sheets of serum amyloid A protein, an acute phase reactant whose physiologic functions include cholesterol transport, immune cell attraction, and metalloproteases activation. Forty percent of patients with AA amyloid have rheumatoid arthritis, and another 10% have ankylosing spondylitis or psoriatic arthritis; the rest derive from other lesser causes. Less common in Western countries but more common in Mediterranean regions, particularly in Sephardic and Iraqi Jews, is familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). FMF is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding pyrin, while Muckle-Wells syndrome, a related disorder, results from a mutation in cryopyrin; both proteins are important in the apoptosis of leukocytes early in inflammation; such proteins with pyrin domains are part of a new pathway called the inflammasome. Receptor mutations in tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1)-associated periodic syndrome also produce chronic inflammation and secondary amyloidosis. Fragments of serum amyloid A protein increase and self-aggregate by attaching to receptors for advanced glycation end products in the extracellular environment; nephrotic syndrome is common, and about 40每60% of patients progress to dialysis. AA and AL amyloid fibrils are detectable with Congo red or in more detail with electron microscopy (Fig. e14-15). Currently developed serum free light chain nephelometry assays are useful in the early diagnosis and follow-up of disease progression. Biopsy of involved liver or kidney is diagnostic 90% of the time when the pretest probability is high; abdominal fat pad aspirates are positive about 70% of the time, but apparently less so when looking for AA amyloid. Amyloid deposits are distributed along blood vessels and in the mesangial regions of the kidney. The treatment for primary amyloidosis is not particularly effective; melphalan and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can delay the course of disease in about 30% of patients. Secondary amyloidosis is also relentless unless the primary disease can be controlled. Some new drugs in development that disrupt the formation of fibrils may be available in the future.

Fibrillary-Immunotactoid Glomerulopathy

Fibrillary-immunotactoid glomerulopathy is a rare (<1.0% of renal biopsies) morphologically defined disease characterized by glomerular accumulation of nonbranching randomly arranged fibrils. Some classify amyloid and nonamyloid fibril-associated renal disease all as fibrillary glomerulopathies with immunotactoid glomerulopathy reserved for nonamyloid fibrillary disease not associated with a systemic illness. Others define fibrillary glomerulonephritis as a nonamyloid fibrillary disease with fibrils 12每24 nm and immunotactoid glomerulonephritis with fibrils >30 nm. In either case, fibrillar/microtubular deposits of oligoclonal or oligotypic immunoglobulins and complement appear in the mesangium and along the glomerular capillary wall. Congo red stains are negative. The cause of this "nonamyloid" glomerulopathy is mostly idiopathic; reports of immunotactoid glomerulonephritis describe an occasional association with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or B cell lymphoma. Both disorders appear in adults in the fourth decade with moderate to heavy proteinuria, hematuria, and a wide variety of histologic lesions, including DPGN, MPGN, MGN, or mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis. Nearly half of patients develop renal failure over a few years. There is no consensus on treatment of this uncommon disorder. The disease has been reported to recur following renal transplantation in a minority of cases.

Fabry's Disease

Fabry's disease is an X-linked inborn error of globotriaosylceramide metabolism secondary to deficient lysosomal -galactosidase A activity, resulting in excessive intracellular storage of globotriaosylceramide. Affected organs include the vascular endothelium, heart, brain, and kidneys. Classically, Fabry's disease presents in childhood in males with acroparesthesias, angiokeratoma, and hypohidrosis. Over time male patients develop cardiomyopathy, cerebrovascular disease, and renal injury, with an average age of death around 50 years of age. Hemizygotes with hypomorphic mutations sometimes present in the fourth to sixth decade with single-organ involvement. Rarely, dominant-negative -galactosidase A mutations or female heterozygotes with unfavorable X inactivation present with mild single-organ involvement. Rare females develop severe manifestations including renal failure but do so later in life than males. Renal biopsy reveals enlarged glomerular visceral epithelial cells packed with small clear vacuoles containing globotriaosylceramide; vacuoles may also be found in parietal and tubular epithelia (Fig. e14-18). These vacuoles of electron-dense materials in parallel arrays (zebra bodies) are easily seen on electron microscopy. Ultimately, renal biopsies reveal FSGS. The nephropathy of Fabry's disease typically presents in the third decade as mild to moderate proteinuria, sometimes with microscopic hematuria or nephrotic syndrome. Urinalysis may reveal oval fat bodies and birefringent glycolipid globules under polarized light (Maltese cross). Renal biopsy is necessary for definitive diagnosis. Progression to renal failure occurs by the fourth or fifth decade. Treatment with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system is recommended. Treatment with recombinant -galactosidase A clears microvascular endothelial deposits of globotriaosylceramide from the kidneys, heart, and skin. The degree of organ involvement at the time when enzyme replacement is initiated is crucial. In patients with advanced organ involvement, progression of disease occurs despite enzyme replacement therapy. Variable responses to enzyme therapy may be due to the occurrence of neutralizing antibodies or differences in uptake of the enzyme. Graft and patient survival following renal transplantation in patients with Fabry's are similar to other causes of end-stage renal disease.
 
Pulmonary-Renal Syndromes

Several diseases can present with catastrophic hemoptysis and glomerulonephritis associated with varying degrees of renal failure. The usual causes include Goodpasture's syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's), microscopic polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss vasculitis, and, rarely, Henoch-Sch?nlein purpura or cryoglobulinemia. Each of these diseases can also present without hemoptysis and are discussed in detail in "Acute Nephritic Syndromes," above. (See Glomerular Schematic 7.) Pulmonary bleeding in this setting is life-threatening and often results in airway intubation, and acute renal failure requires dialysis. Diagnosis is difficult initially because biopsies and serologic testing take time. Treatment with plasmapheresis and methylprednisolone is often empirical and temporizing until results of testing are available.
 
Basement Membrane Syndromes

All kidney epithelia, including podocytes, rest on basement membranes assembled into a planar surface through the interweaving of collagen IV with laminins, nidogen, and sulfated proteoglycans. Structural abnormalities in GBM associated with hematuria are characteristic of several familial disorders related to the expression of collagen IV genes. The extended family of collagen IV contains six chains, which are expressed in different tissues at different stages of embryonic development. All epithelial basement membranes early in human development are composed of interconnected triple-helical protomers rich in 1.1.2(IV) collagen. Some specialized tissues undergo a developmental switch replacing 1.1.2(IV) protomers with an 3.4.5(IV) collagen network; this switch occurs in the kidney (glomerular and tubular basement membrane), lung, testis, cochlea, and eye, while an 5.5.6(IV) network appears in skin, smooth muscle, and esophagus and along Bowman's capsule in the kidney. This switch probably occurs because the 3.4.5(IV) network is more resistant to proteases and ensures the structural longevity of critical tissues. When basement membranes are the target of glomerular disease, they produce moderate proteinuria, some hematuria, and progressive renal failure.

Anti-GBM Disease

Autoimmune disease where antibodies are directed against the 3 NC1 domain of collagen IV produces an anti-GBM disease often associated with RPGN and/or a pulmonary-renal syndrome called Goodpasture's syndrome. Discussion of this disease is covered in "Acute Nephritic Syndromes," above.

Alport's Syndrome

Classically, patients with Alport's syndrome develop hematuria, thinning and splitting of the GBMs, mild proteinuria (<1每2 g/24 h), which appears late in the course, followed by chronic glomerulosclerosis leading to renal failure in association with sensorineural deafness. Some patients develop lenticonus of the anterior lens capsule, "dot and fleck" retinopathy, and rarely, mental retardation or leiomyomatosis. Approximately 85% of patients with Alport's syndrome have an X-linked inheritance of mutations in the 5(IV) collagen chain on chromosome Xq22每24. Female carriers have variable penetrance depending on the type of mutation or the degree of mosaicism created by X inactivation. Fifteen percent of patients have autosomal recessive disease of the 3(IV) or 4(IV) chains on chromosome 2q35每37. Rarely, some kindred have an autosomal dominant inheritance of dominant-negative mutations in 3(IV) or 4(IV) chains.

Pedigrees with the X-linked syndrome are quite variable in their rate and frequency of tissue damage leading to organ failure. Seventy percent of patients have the juvenile form with nonsense or missense mutations, reading frame shifts, or large deletions and generally develop renal failure and sensorineural deafness by age 30. Patients with splice variants, exon skipping, or missense mutations of -helical glycines generally deteriorate after the age of 30 (adult form) with mild or late deafness. Early severe deafness, lenticonus, or proteinuria suggests a poorer prognosis. Usually females from X-linked pedigrees have only microhematuria, but up to 25% of carrier females have been reported to have more severe renal manifestations. Pedigrees with the autosomal recessive form of the disease have severe early disease in both females and males with asymptomatic parents.

Clinical evaluation should include a careful eye examination and hearing tests. However, the absence of extrarenal symptoms does not rule out the diagnosis. Since 5(IV) collagen is expressed in the skin, some X-linked Alport patients can be diagnosed with a skin biopsy revealing the lack of the 5(IV) collagen chain on immunofluorescent analysis. Other patients with suspected disease require a renal biopsy. Alport's patients early in their disease typically have thin basement membranes on renal biopsy (Fig. e14-19), which thicken over time into multilamellations surrounding lucent areas that often contain granules of varying density〞the so-called split basement membrane. In any Alport kidney there are areas of thinning mixed with splitting of the GBM. Tubules drop out, glomeruli scar, and the kidney eventually succumbs to interstitial fibrosis. Primary treatment is control of systemic hypertension and use of ACE inhibitors to slow renal progression. Although patients who receive renal allografts usually develop anti-GBM antibodies directed toward the collagen epitopes absent in their native kidney, overt Goodpasture's syndrome is rare and graft survival is good.

Thin Basement Membrane Disease

Thin basement membrane disease (TBMD) characterized by persistent or recurrent hematuria is not typically associated with proteinuria, hypertension, or loss of renal function or extrarenal disease. Although not all cases are familial (perhaps a founder effect), it usually presents in childhood in multiple family members and is also called benign familial hematuria. Cases of TBMD have genetic defects in type IV collagen but in contrast to Alport behave as an autosomal dominant disorder that in ~40% of families segregates with the COL(IV) 3/COL(IV) 4 loci. Mutations in these loci can result in a spectrum of disease ranging from TBMD to autosomal dominant or recessive Alport's. The GBM shows diffuse thinning compared to normal values for the patient's age in otherwise normal biopsies (Fig. e14-19). The vast majority of patients have a benign course.

Nail-Patella Syndrome

Patients with nail-patella syndrome develop iliac horns on the pelvis and dysplasia of the dorsal limbs involving the patella, elbows, and nails, variably associated with neural-sensory hearing impairment, glaucoma, and abnormalities of the GBM and podocytes, leading to hematuria, proteinuria, and FSGS. The syndrome is autosomal dominant, with haploinsufficiency for the LIM homeodomain transcription factor LMX1B; pedigrees are extremely variable in the penetrance for all features of the disease. LMX1B regulates the expression of genes encoding 3 and 4 chains of collagen IV, interstitial type III collagen, podocin, and CD2AP that help form the slit-pore membranes connecting podocytes. Mutations in the LIM domain region of LMX1B associate with glomerulopathy, and renal failure appears in as many as 30% of patients. Proteinuria or isolated hematuria is discovered throughout life, but usually by the third decade, and is inexplicably more common in females. On renal biopsy there is lucent damage to the lamina densa of the GBM, an increase in collagen III fibrils along glomerular capillaries and in the mesangium, and damage to the slit-pore membrane, producing heavy proteinuria not unlike that seen in congenital nephrotic syndrome. Patients with renal failure do well with transplantation.
 
Glomerular-Vascular Syndromes

A variety of diseases result in classic vascular injury to the glomerular capillaries. Most of these processes also damage blood vessels elsewhere in the body. The group of diseases discussed here lead to vasculitis, renal endothelial injury, thrombosis, ischemia, and/or lipid-based occlusions.

Atherosclerotic Nephropathy

Aging in the developed world is commonly associated with the occlusion of coronary and systemic blood vessels. The reasons for this include obesity, insulin resistance, smoking, hypertension, and diets rich in lipids that deposit in the arterial and arteriolar circulation, producing local inflammation and fibrosis of small blood vessels. When the renal arterial circulation is involved, the glomerular microcirculation is damaged, leading to chronic nephrosclerosis. Patients with GFRs <60 mL/min have more cardiovascular events and hospitalizations than those with higher filtration rates. Several aggressive lipid disorders can accelerate this process, but most of the time atherosclerotic progression to chronic nephrosclerosis is associated with poorly controlled hypertension. Approximately 10% of glomeruli are normally sclerotic by age 40, rising to 20% by age 60 and 30% by age 80. Serum lipid profiles in humans are greatly affected by apolipoprotein E polymorphisms; the E4 allele is accompanied by increases in serum cholesterol and is more closely associated with atherogenic profiles in patients with renal failure. Mutations in E2 alleles, particularly in Japanese patients, produce a specific renal abnormality called lipoprotein glomerulopathy associated with glomerular lipoprotein thrombi and capillary dilation.

Hypertensive Nephrosclerosis

Uncontrolled systemic hypertension causes permanent damage to the kidneys in about 6% of patients with elevated blood pressure. As many as 27% of patients with end-stage kidney disease have hypertension as a primary cause. Although there is not a clear correlation between the extent or duration of hypertension and the risk of end-organ damage, hypertensive nephrosclerosis is fivefold more frequent in African Americans than whites. Risk alleles associated with APOL1, a functional gene for apolipoprotein L1 expressed in podocytes substantially explains the increased burden of end-stage renal disease among African Americans. Associated risk factors for progression to end-stage kidney disease include age, sex, race, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, duration of hypertension, low birth weight, and preexisting renal injury. Kidney biopsies in patients with hypertension, microhematuria, and moderate proteinuria demonstrate arteriolosclerosis, chronic nephrosclerosis, and interstitial fibrosis in the absence of immune deposits (Fig. e14-21). Today, based on a careful history, physical examination, urinalysis, and some serologic testing, the diagnosis of chronic nephrosclerosis is usually inferred without a biopsy. Treating hypertension is the best way to avoid progressive renal failure; most guidelines recommend lowering blood pressure to <130/80 mmHg if there is preexisting diabetes or kidney disease. In the presence of kidney disease, most patients begin therapy with two drugs, classically a thiazide diuretic and an ACE inhibitor; most will require three drugs. There is strong evidence in African Americans with hypertensive nephrosclerosis that therapy initiated with an ACE inhibitor can slow the rate of decline in renal function independent of effects on systemic blood pressure. Malignant acceleration of hypertension complicates the course of chronic nephrosclerosis, particularly in the setting of scleroderma or cocaine use (Fig. e14-24). The hemodynamic stress of malignant hypertension leads to fibrinoid necrosis of small blood vessels, thrombotic microangiography, a nephritic urinalysis, and acute renal failure. In the setting of renal failure, chest pain, or papilledema, the condition is treated as a hypertensive emergency. Slightly lowering the blood pressure often produces an immediate reduction in GFR that improves as the vascular injury attenuates and autoregulation of blood vessel tone is restored.

Cholesterol Emboli

Aging patients with clinical complications from atherosclerosis sometimes shower cholesterol crystals into the circulation〞either spontaneously or, more commonly, following an endovascular procedure with manipulation of the aorta〞or with use of systemic anticoagulation. Spontaneous emboli may shower acutely or shower subacutely and somewhat more silently. Irregular emboli trapped in the microcirculation produce ischemic damage that induces an inflammatory reaction. Depending on the location of the atherosclerotic plaques releasing these cholesterol fragments, one may see cerebral transient ischemic attacks; livedo reticularis in the lower extremities; Hollenhorst plaques in the retina with visual field cuts; necrosis of the toes; and acute glomerular capillary injury leading to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis sometimes associated with hematuria, mild proteinuria, and loss of renal function, which typically progresses over a few years. Occasional patients have fever, eosinophilia, or eosinophiluria. A skin biopsy of an involved area may be diagnostic. Since tissue fixation dissolves the cholesterol, one typically sees only residual, biconvex clefts in involved vessels (Fig. e14-22). There is no therapy to reverse embolic occlusions, and steroids do not help. Controlling blood pressure and lipids and cessation of smoking are usually recommended for prevention.

Sickle Cell Disease

Although individuals with SA-hemoglobin are usually asymptomatic, most will gradually develop hyposthenuria due to subclinical infarction of the renal medulla, thus predisposing them to volume depletion; interestingly, there is an unexpectedly high prevalence of sickle trait among dialysis patients who are African American. Patients with homozygous SS-sickle cell disease develop chronic vasoocclusive disease in many organs. Polymers of deoxygenated SS-hemoglobin distort the shape of red blood cells. These cells attach to endothelia and obstruct small blood vessels, producing frequent, random, and painful sickle cell crises over time. Vessel occlusions in the kidney produce glomerular hypertension, FSGS, interstitial nephritis, and renal infarction associated with hyposthenuria, microscopic hematuria, and even gross hematuria; some patients also present with MPGN. By the second or third decade of life, persistent vasoocclusive disease in the kidney leads to varying degrees of renal failure, and some patients end up on dialysis. Treatment is directed to reducing the frequency of painful crises and administering ACE inhibitors in the hope of delaying a progressive decline in renal function. In sickle cell patients undergoing renal transplantation, renal graft survival is comparable to African Americans in the general transplant population.

Thrombotic Microangiopathies

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) represent a spectrum of thrombotic microangiopathies. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic-uremic syndrome share the general features of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic anemia, fever, renal failure, and neurologic disturbances. When patients, particularly children, have more evidence of renal injury, their condition tends to be called HUS. In adults with neurologic disease, it is considered to be TTP. In adults there is often a mixture of both, which is why they are often called TTP/HUS. On examination of kidney tissue there is evidence of glomerular capillary endotheliosis associated with platelet thrombi, damage to the capillary wall, and formation of fibrin material in and around glomeruli (Fig. e14-23). These tissue findings are similar to what is seen in preeclampsia/HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome), malignanthypertension, and the antiphospholipid syndrome. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic-uremic syndrome is also seen in pregnancy; with the use of oral contraceptives or quinine; in renal transplant patients given OKT3 for rejection; in patients taking the calcineurin inhibitors, cyclosporine and tacrolimus, or in patients taking the antiplatelet agents, ticlopidine and clopidogrel; or following HIV infection.

Although there is no agreement on how much they share a final common pathophysiology, two general groups of patients are recognized: childhood HUS associated with enterohemorrhagic diarrhea and TTP/HUS in adults. Childhood HUS is caused by a toxin released by Escherichia coli 0157:H7 and occasionally by Shigella dysenteriae. This shiga toxin (verotoxin) directly injures endothelia, enterocytes, and renal cells, causing apoptosis, platelet clumping, and intravascular hemolysis by binding to the glycolipid receptors (Gb3). These receptors are more abundant along endothelia in children compared to adults. Shiga toxin also inhibits the endothelial production of ADAMTS13. In familial cases of adult TTP/HUS, there is a genetic deficiency of the ADAMTS13 metalloprotease that cleaves large multimers of von Willebrand's factor. Absent ADAMTS13, these large multimers cause platelet clumping and intravascular hemolysis. An antibody to ADAMTS13 is found in many sporadic cases of adult TTP/HUS, but not all; many patients also have antibodies to the thrombospondin receptor on selected endothelial cells in small vessels or increased levels of plasminogen-activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). Some children with complement protein deficiencies express atypical HUS (aHUS), which can be treated with liver transplant. The treatment of adult TTP/HUS is daily plasmapheresis, which can be lifesaving. Plasmapheresis is given until the platelet count rises, but in relapsing patients it normally is continued well after the platelet count improves, and in resistant patients twice-daily exchange may be helpful. Most patients respond within 2 weeks of daily plasmapheresis. Since TTP/HUS often has an autoimmune basis, there is an anecdotal role in relapsing patients for using splenectomy, steroids, immunosuppressive drugs, or rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody. Patients with childhood HUS from infectious diarrhea are not given antibiotics, as antibiotics are thought to accelerate the release of the toxin and the diarrhea is usually self-limited. No intervention appears superior to supportive therapy in children with postdiarrheal HUS.

Infectious Disease每Associated Syndromes

A number of infectious diseases will injure the glomerular capillaries as part of a systemic reaction producing an immune response or from direct infection of renal tissue. Evidence of this immune response is collected by glomeruli in the form of immune deposits that damage the kidney, producing moderate proteinuria and hematuria. Some of these infectious diseases represent the most common causes of glomerulonephritis in many parts of the world.

Post-Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis

This form of glomerulonephritis is one of the classic complications of streptococcal infection. The discussion of this disease can be found in the section on acute nephritic syndromes.

Subacute Bacterial Endocarditis

Renal injury from persistent bacteremia absent the continued presence of a foreign body, regardless of cause, is treated presumptively as if the patient has endocarditis. The discussion of this disease can be found in the section on acute nephritic syndromes.

Human Immunodeficiency Virus

Renal disease is an important complication of HIV disease. The risk of development of end-stage renal disease is much higher in HIV-infected African Americans than in HIV-infected whites. About 50% of HIV-infected patients with kidney disease have HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) on biopsy. The lesion in HIVAN is FSGS, characteristically revealing a collapsing glomerulopathy (Fig. e14-3) with visceral epithelial cell swelling, microcystic dilatation of renal tubules, and tubuloreticular inclusion. Renal epithelial cells express replicating HIV virus, but host immune responses also play a role in the pathogenesis. MPGN and DPGN have also been reported but more commonly in HIV-infected whites and in patients coinfected with hepatitis B or C. HIV-associated TTP has also been reported. Other renal lesions include DPGN, IgA nephropathy, and MCD. Renal biopsy may be indicated to distinguish between these lesions.

HIV patients with FSGS typically present with nephrotic-range proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia, but unlike patients with other etiologies for nephrotic syndrome, they do not commonly have hypertension, edema, or hyperlipidemia. Renal ultrasound also reveals large, echogenic kidneys despite the finding that renal function in some patients declines rapidly. Treatment with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system decreases the proteinuria. Effective antiretroviral therapy benefits both the patient and the kidney and improves survival of HIV-infected patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease. In HIV-infected patients not yet on therapy, the presence of HIVAN is an indication to initiate therapy. Following the introduction of antiretroviral therapy, survival on dialysis for the HIV-infected patient has improved dramatically and is equivalent in patients treated with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Renal transplants in HIV-infected patients without detectable viral loads or histories of opportunistic infections have a better survival benefit over dialysis. Following transplantation, patient and graft survival are similar to the general transplant population despite frequent rejections.

Hepatitis B and C

Typically infected patients present with microscopic hematuria, nonnephrotic or nephrotic-range proteinuria, and hypertension. There is a close association between hepatitis B infection and polyarteritis nodosa with vasculitis appearing generally in the first 6 months following infection. Renal manifestations include renal artery aneurysms, renal infarction, and ischemic scars. Alternatively, the hepatitis B carrier state can produce a MGN that is more common in children than adults, or MPGN that is more common in adults than in children. Renal histology is indistinguishable from idiopathic MGN or type I MPGN. Viral antigens are found in the renal deposits. There are no good treatment guidelines, but interferon -2b and lamivudine have been used to some effect in small studies. Children have a good prognosis, with 60每65% achieving spontaneous remission within 4 years. In contrast, 30% of adults have renal insufficiency and 10% have renal failure 5 years after diagnosis.

Up to 30% of patients with chronic hepatitis C infection have some renal manifestations. Patients often present with type II mixed cryoglobulinemia, nephrotic syndrome, microscopic hematuria, abnormal liver function tests, depressed C3 levels, anti每hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies, and viral RNA in the blood. The renal lesions most commonly seen, in order of decreasing frequency, are cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis, MGN, and type I MPGN. Treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin is typical to reduce the viral load.

Other Viruses

Other viral infections are occasionally associated with glomerular lesions, but cause and effect are not well established. These viral infections and their respective glomerular lesions include: cytomegalovirus producing MPGN; influenza and anti-GBM disease; measles-associated endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis, with measles antigen in the capillary loops and mesangium; parvovirus causing mild proliferative or mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis or FSGS; mumps and mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis; Epstein-Barr virus producing MPGN, diffuse proliferative nephritis, or IgA nephropathy; dengue hemorrhagic fever causing endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis; and coxsackievirus producing focalglomerulonephritis or DPGN.

Syphilis

Secondary syphilis, with rash and constitutional symptoms, develops weeks to months after the chancre first appears and occasionally presents with the nephrotic syndrome from MGN caused by subepithelial immune deposits containing treponemal antigens. Other lesions have also rarely been described including interstitial syphilitic nephritis. The diagnosis is confirmed with nontreponemal and treponemal tests for Treponema pallidum. The renal lesion responds to treatment with penicillin or an alternative drug, if allergic. Additional testing for other sexually transmitted diseases is an important part of disease management.

Leprosy

Despite aggressive eradication programs, approximately 400,000 new cases of leprosy appear annually worldwide. The diagnosis is best made in patients with multiple skin lesions accompanied by sensory loss in affected areas, using skin smears showing paucibacillary or multibacillary infection (WHO criteria). Leprosy is caused by infection with Mycobacterium leprae and can be classified by Ridley-Jopling criteria into various types: tuberculoid, borderline tuberculoid, mid-borderline and borderline lepromatous, and lepromatous. Renal involvement in leprosy is related to the quantity of bacilli in the body, and the kidney is one of the target organs during splanchnic localization. In some series, all cases with borderline lepromatous and lepromatous types of leprosy have various forms of renal involvement including FSGS, mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, or renal amyloidosis; much less common are the renal lesions of DPGN and MPGN. Treatment with dapsone, rifampicin, and clofazimine can eradicate the infection in nearly all patients.

Malaria

There are 300每500 million incident cases of malaria each year worldwide, and the kidney is commonly involved. Glomerulonephritis is due to immune complexes containing malarial antigens that are implanted in the glomerulus. In malaria from P. falciparum, mild proteinuria is associated with subendothelial deposits, mesangial deposits, and mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis that usually resolve with treatment. In quartan malaria from infection with P. malariae, children are more commonly affected and renal involvement is more severe. Transient proteinuria and microscopic hematuria can resolve with treatment of the infection. However, resistant nephrotic syndrome with progression to renal failure over 3每5 years does happen, as <50% of patients respond to steroid therapy. Affected patients with nephrotic syndrome have thickening of the glomerular capillary walls, with subendothelial deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3 associated with a sparse membranoproliferative lesion. The rare mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis reported with P. vivax or P. ovale typically has a benign course.

Schistosomiasis

Schistosomiasis affects more than 300 million people worldwide and primarily involves the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts. Glomerular involvement varies with the specific strain of schistosomiasis; Schistosoma mansoni is most commonly associated with clinical renal disease, and the glomerular lesions can be classified: Class I is a mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis; class II is an extracapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis; class III is a membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis; class IV is a focal segmental glomerulonephritis; and class V lesions have amyloidosis. Classes I每II often remit with treatment of the infection, but classes III and IV lesions are associated with IgA immune deposits and progress despite antiparasitic and/or immunosuppressive therapy.

Other Parasites

Renal involvement with toxoplasmosis infections is rare. When it occurs, patients present with nephrotic syndrome and have a histologic picture of MPGN. Fifty percent of patients with leishmaniasis will have mild to moderate proteinuria and microscopic hematuria, but renal insufficiency is rare. Acute DPGN, MGN, and mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis have all been observed on biopsy. Filariasis and trichinosis are caused by nematodes and are sometimes associated with glomerular injury presenting with proteinuria, hematuria, and a variety of histologic lesions that typically resolve with eradication of the infection.

Introduction

The polycystic kidney diseases are among the most common life-threatening inherited diseases worldwide and frequently cause kidney failure. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is seen predominantly in adults (Fig. 284-1), whereas autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is mainly a disease of childhood. Renal cysts also are seen in several other hereditary kidney diseases (Table 284-1), some of which may have defects in a common signaling pathway with ADPKD and ARPKD. Other inherited tubular diseases manifest primarily with alterations in fluid, electrolyte, acid-base, and mineral balance (Table 284-2).

Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease

Etiology and Pathogenesis

ADPKD is a systemic disorder resulting from mutations in either the PKD-1 or the PKD-2 gene. The PKD-1-encoded protein, polycystin-1, is a large receptor-like molecule, whereas the PKD-2 gene product, polycystin-2, has features of a calcium channel protein. Both are transmembrane proteins that are present throughout all segments of the nephron. They have been localized to the luminal surface of tubular cells in primary cilia, where they appear to serve as flow sensors; on the basal surface in focal adhesion complexes; and on the lateral surface in adherens junctions. The proteins are thought to function independently, or as a complex, to regulate fetal and adult epithelial cell gene transcription, apoptosis, differentiation, and cell-matrix interactions. Disruption of these processes leads to epithelial dedifferentiation, unregulated proliferation and apoptosis, altered cell polarity, disorganization of surrounding extracellular matrix, excessive fluid secretion, and abnormal expression of several genes, including some that encode growth factors. Vasopressin-mediated elevation of cyclic AMP levels in cystepithelia plays a major role in cystogenesis by stimulating cell proliferation and fluid secretion into the cyst lumen through apical chloride and aquaporin channels. Cyst formation begins in utero from any point along the nephron, although <5% of total nephrons are thought to be involved. As the cysts accumulate fluid, they enlarge, separate entirely from the nephron, compress the neighboring renal parenchyma, and progressively compromise renal function.

Genetic Considerations

ADPKD occurs in 1:400每1:1000 individuals worldwide and accounts for ~4% of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States. ADPKD is equally prevalent in all ethnic and racial groups. Over 90% of cases are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, with the remainder probably representing spontaneous mutations. Mutations in the PKD-1 gene on chromosome 16 (ADPKD-1) account for 85% of cases, and mutations in the PKD-2 gene on chromosome 4 (ADPKD-2) account for the remainder. A few families appear to have a defect at a site that is different from either of these loci. Direct mutation analysis of isolated cysts suggests that there is loss of heterozygosity, whereby a somatic mutation in the normal allele of a small number of tubular epithelial cells leads to unregulated clonal proliferation of the cells that ultimately form the cyst lining.

Clinical Features

Phenotypic heterogeneity is a hallmark of ADPKD, as evidenced by family members who have the same mutation but have a different clinical course. Affected individuals are often asymptomatic into the fourth or fifth decade. Presenting symptoms and signs include abdominal discomfort, hematuria, urinary tract infection, incidental discovery of hypertension, abdominal masses, elevated serum creatinine, and cystic kidneys on imaging studies (Fig. 284-1A and B). Frequently, the diagnosis is made before the onset of symptoms, when asymptomatic members in affected families request screening. In most patients, renal function declines progressively over the course of 10每20 years from the time of diagnosis, but not everyone with ADPKD develops ESRD; it occurs in about 60% of these patients by age 70. Those with ADPKD-2 tend to have later onset and slower progression. Hypertension is common and often precedes renal dysfunction, perhaps mediated by increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system. There is only mild proteinuria, and impaired urinary concentrating ability manifests early as polyuria and nocturia. Risk factors for progressive kidney disease include younger age at diagnosis, black race, male sex, presence of polycystin-1 mutation, and hypertension. There is a close correlation between the rate of kidney expansion, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, and the rate of decline in kidney function. Dull, persistent flank and abdominal pain and early satiety are common due to the mass effect of the enlarged kidneys or liver. Cyst rupture or hemorrhage into a cyst may produce acute flank pain or symptoms and signs of localized peritonitis. Gross hematuria may result from cyst rupture into the collecting system or from uric acid or calcium oxalate kidney stones. Nephrolithiasis occurs in about 20% of patients. Urinary tract infection, including acute pyelonephritis, occurs with increased frequency in ADPKD. Infection in a kidney cyst is a particularly serious complication. It is most often due to Gram-negative bacteria and presents with flank pain, fever, and chills. Blood cultures are frequently positive, but urine culture may be negative because infected kidney cysts do not communicate directly with the collecting system. Distinguishing between infection and cyst hemorrhage is often challenging, and the diagnosis relies mainly on clinical and bacteriologic findings. Radiologic and nuclear imaging studies are generally not helpful.

Numerous extrarenal manifestations of ADPKD highlight the systemic nature of the disease. Patients with ADPKD have a twofold to fourfold increased risk of subarachnoid or cerebral hemorrhage from a ruptured intracranial aneurysm compared with the general population. Saccular aneurysms of the anterior cerebral circulation may be detected in up to 10% of asymptomatic patients on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) screening, but most are small, have a low risk of spontaneous rupture, and do not merit the risk of intervention. In general, hemorrhage tends to occur before age 50 years, in patients with a family history of intracranial hemorrhage, and in those who have survived a previous bleed, have aneurysms >10 mm, and have uncontrolled hypertension. Other vascular abnormalities include aortic root and annulus dilation. Cardiac valvular abnormalities occur in 25% of patients, most commonly mitral valve prolapse and aortic regurgitation. Although most valvular lesions are asymptomatic, some may progress over time and warrant valve replacement. The incidence of hepatic cysts is 83% by MRI in patients age 15每46 years. Most patients are asymptomatic with normal liver function tests, but hepatic cysts may bleed, become infected, rupture, and cause pain. Although the frequency of liver cysts is equal between the sexes, women are more likely to have massive cysts (Fig. 284-1C). Colonic diverticulae are common, with a higher incidence of perforation in patients with ADPKD. Abdominal wall and inguinal hernias also occur with a higher frequency than in the general population.

Diagnosis and Screening

Most often, the diagnosis of ADPKD is made from a positive family history and imaging studies showing large kidneys with multiple bilateral cysts and possibly liver cysts (Fig. 284-1). Criteria for the diagnosis of ADPKD by ultrasonography in asymptomatic individuals account for the later onset of ADPKD-2 and assume that the genotype of the individual and family being tested is unknown. The presence of three or more cysts in one or both kidneys is required to diagnose ADPKD in patients age 15每39 years with a specificity and positive predictive value of 100%; sensitivity varies from 82 to 96% for persons age 15每29 and 30每39 years, respectively. The presence of two or more cysts in each kidney is associated with a sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 100%, respectively, in patients age 40每59 years. In subjects older than 60 years, the presence of four or more cysts in each kidney is required to diagnose ADPKD because of the increased frequency of benign simple cysts, whereas fewer than two renal cysts in at-risk individuals age 40 years is sufficient to exclude the disease. Computed tomography (CT) scan and T2-weighted MRI are more sensitive for detecting presymptomatic disease in young patients. Genetic linkage analysis and mutational screening for ADPKD-1 and ADPKD-2 is available for equivocal cases, especially when a young adult from an affected family is being considered as a potential kidney donor. Genetic counseling is essential for those being screened. Screening for asymptomatic intracranial aneurysms should be restricted to patients with a personal or family history of intracranial hemorrhage and those in high-risk occupations. Intervention should be limited to aneurysms larger than 10 mm.

Treatment: Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease

No treatment has been proved to prevent cyst growth or the decline in kidney function. Hypertension control with a target blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg or less is recommended according to Joint National Committee (JNC) VII guidelines. A multidrug approach that includes agents to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system is frequently required. Studies are investigating the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in slowing growth of kidney volume and loss of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Lipid-soluble antimicrobials such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and fluoroquinolones that have good cyst penetration are the preferred therapy for infected kidney and liver cysts. Pain management occasionally requires cyst drainage by percutaneous aspiration, sclerotherapy with alcohol, or, rarely, surgical drainage. Patients with ADPKD appear to have a survival advantage on either peritoneal or hemodialysis compared with patients with other causes of ESRD. Those undergoing kidney transplantation may require bilateral nephrectomy if the kidneys are massively enlarged or have been the site of infected cysts. Posttransplantation survival rates are similar to those of patients with other causes of kidney failure, but these patients remain at risk for the extrarenal complications of ADPKD. Studies in animal models of inherited cystic diseases have identified promising therapeutic strategies, including vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists that suppress cyst growth by lowering intracellular cAMP, and inhibitors of cell dedifferentiation and proliferation that target the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Clinical trials of these agents are ongoing.

Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease

Genetic Considerations

ARPKD is primarily a disease of infants and children. The incidence is 1:20,000 births. The kidneys are enlarged, with small cysts, <5 mm, limited to the collecting tubules. The ARPKD gene on chromosome 6p21, PKHD1, encodes several alternatively spliced transcripts (Table 284-1). The largest transcript produces a multidomain transmembrane protein termed fibrocystin (polyductin) that is found in the cortical and medullary collecting ducts and the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop in the kidney as well as in biliary and pancreatic duct epithelia. Like the polycystins, fibrocystin has receptor-like features and may be involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Fibrocystin, the polycystins, and several proteins involved in animal models of PKD are located in association with primary cilia on the tubular epithelial cell apical surface; this suggests that they may cooperate in a mechanosensory pathway. A large number of different mutations have been identified throughout PKHD1 and are unique to individual families. Most patients are compound heterozygotes. Those with two truncating mutations frequently die shortly after birth, whereas those who survive beyond the neonatal period generally have at least one missense mutation. Mutations in PKHD1 have also been identified in about 30% of children with congenital hepatic fibrosis (Caroli's syndrome) without evident kidney involvement.

Clinical Features

The clinical presentation of ARPKD is highly variable. Up to 50% of affected neonates die of pulmonary hypoplasia, the result of oligohydramnios from severe intrauterine kidney disease. About 80% of those who survive the neonatal period are still alive after 10 years; however, one-third will have developed ESRD. Enlarged kidneys may be detected soon after birth as bilateral abdominal masses. Impaired urinary concentrating ability and metabolic acidosis ensue as tubular function deteriorates. Hypertension often occurs in the first few years of life. Kidney function deteriorates progressively from childhood into early adult life. Longer-term survivors frequently develop complications of portal hypertension from periportal fibrosis.

Diagnosis

Ultrasonography reveals large, echogenic kidneys. The diagnosis can be made in utero after 24 weeks of gestation in severe cases, but cysts generally become visible only after birth. The absence of renal cysts in either parent on ultrasonography helps distinguish ARPKD from ADPKD in older patients. The wide range of different mutations and the large size of the gene complicate molecular diagnosis, although prenatal diagnosis is possible by gene linkage to the PKHD1 locus in families with a previous confirmed ARPKD birth.

Treatment: Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease

There is no specific therapy for ARPKD. Improvements in neonatal intensive care, blood pressure management, dialysis, and kidney transplantation have led to survival into adulthood. Complications of hepatic fibrosis may necessitate liver transplantation. Future therapies may target aberrant cell signaling mechanisms, as in ADPKD.

Nephronophthisis

Genetics and Pathogenesis

Nephronophthisis (NPHP) is the most common genetic cause of ESRD in childhood and adolescence. Eleven distinct genetic mutations with autosomal recessive inheritance have been identified to date and produce different renal and extrarenal manifestations of NPHP (Table 284-1). Although their precise functions are unclear, the defective protein products, named nephrocystins and inversin, localize to the primary cilium and associated basal body of renal epithelial cells, similar to the polycystins and fibrocystin. NPHP is classified into infantile, juvenile, and adolescent forms based on the age of ESRD onset. In juvenile NPHP, the most common form, the kidneys are shrunken and histology shows tubular atrophy, thickening of tubular basement membranes, diffuse interstitial fibrosis, and microscopic medullary cysts. In the infantile form, the kidneys are large with histology similar to that of the juvenile form except that medullary cysts are more prominent and develop earlier.

Clinical Features

In juvenile NPHP symptoms typically appear after 1 year of age. Impaired tubular function causes salt wasting and defective urinary concentration and acidification. Patients may present with polyuria, polydipsia, volume depletion, or systemic acidosis. Hypertension is usually absent due to salt wasting. Progressive kidney failure and volume depletion lead to growth retardation. On average, ESRD occurs by age 3 in the infantile form, age 13 in the juvenile form, and age 19 in the adolescent form. Up to 15% of patients with juvenile NPHP have extrarenal manifestations (Table 284-1), most commonly retinitis pigmentosa (Senior-Loken syndrome). Other abnormalities include blindness from amaurosis, oculomotor apraxia, cerebellar ataxia (Joubert syndrome), polydactyly, mental retardation, hepatic fibrosis, and ventricular septal defect. Situs inversus is seen in some cases of infantile NPHP, consistent with mutation in INVS (NPHP2), a gene critical for left-right patterning in the embryo.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of NPHP should be considered in patients with a family history of kidney disease, early-onset progressive renal failure, and a bland urine sediment with minimal proteinuria. Ultrasonography reveals small hyperechoic kidneys in juvenile NPHP and large kidneys with cysts in the infantile form.

Treatment: Nephronophthisis

There is no specific therapy to prevent loss of kidney function in NPHP. Salt and water replacement are required for patients with salt wasting and polyuria. Therapy should include sodium bicarbonate or citrate for acidosis, management of chronic kidney disease, and timely institution of dialysis and kidney transplantation. NPHP does not recur in transplanted kidneys.

Medullary Cystic Kidney Disease

Genetic Considerations

The medullary cystic kidney diseases (MCKDs) generally present in young adults. Two genetic loci have been defined, both with autosomal dominant transmission (Table 284-1). The locus for MCKD1 has been mapped to chromosome 1q21. Mutations in the uromodulin gene (UMOD) that encodes the Tamm-Horsfall mucoprotein on chromosome 16p12 have been identified in MCKD2.

Clinical Features

As with NPHP, patients with MCKD have atrophic kidneys with diffuse interstitial fibrosis, cysts restricted to the renal medulla, salt wasting, and polyuria. Disease onset is later than in NPHP. Consequently, there is no growth retardation, salt wasting is milder, and ESRD occurs later, usually between ages 20 and 70. There are no extrarenal manifestations in MCKD1, but most patients with MCKD2 have severe hyperuricemia and precocious onset of gout.

Diagnosis

MCKD should be considered in young adults with a family history suggesting dominant inheritance of kidney disease who present with progressive renal failure, bland urinalysis with little or no proteinuria, and small dense kidneys with medullary cysts on radiographic imaging. The presence of hyperuricemia and gout is a further clue to the diagnosis of MCKD2, which can be confirmed by mutation analysis of UMOD.

Treatment: Medullary Cystic Kidney Disease

There is no specific therapy for MCKD. Allopurinol is indicated for patients with gout and is reasonable for those with asymptomatic hyperuricemia, although there is no evidence that it prevents progressive renal failure in MCKD2. Dialysis and transplantation outcomes appear to be favorable. The disease does not recur in transplanted kidneys.

Tuberous Sclerosis

Tuberous sclerosis (TS) is an autosomal dominant disorder that affects 1 in 6000 people. It results from mutations in either the TSC1 gene encoding hamartin or the TSC2 gene encoding tuberin (Table 284-1). Hamartin and tubulin form a complex that is thought to negatively regulate cell growth and proliferation through inhibition of mTOR. The presence of either mutation produces uncontrolled proliferation in numerous tissues, including the kidneys, skin, central nervous system, and heart. The kidneys are affected in 80% of patients. Renal TS occurs in three forms: renal angiomyolipomas, renal cysts, and renal cell carcinoma. Angiomyolipomas are the most common renal abnormality. They occur bilaterally, are often multiple, and are usually asymptomatic; however, they may cause spontaneous bleeding, flank pain, hematuria, and life-threatening retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Large lesions, >4 cm, are more likely to be symptomatic and may require transcatheter arterial embolization or surgical excision. Cysts are usually asymptomatic and are not evident on imaging studies until adulthood. Rarely, cysts may be large and numerous, sometimes leading to ESRD and producing a clinical scenario that can be confused with ADPKD, especially if there are few other systemic manifestations of TS. Multicentric renal cell carcinomas occur with increased frequency in TS. Patients with TS should be screened for renal involvement at initial diagnosis with ultrasonography or CT. Those with cysts or angiomyolipomas require regular imaging to monitor for the development of renal cell carcinoma.

Von Hippel-Lindau Disease

Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is a rare autosomal dominant disease characterized by abnormal angiogenesis with benign and malignant tumors that affect multiple tissues. The disease is inherited as a mutation in one allele of the VHL tumor-suppressor gene. Somatic mutation of the normal allele leads to retinal angiomas, central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas, pheochromocytomas and multicentric clear cell cysts, hemangiomas, and adenomas of the kidney. The kidneys are affected in three-quarters of patients, and half these patients develop clear cell carcinomas in the renal cysts. It is noteworthy that VHL mutations also account for 60% of spontaneous clear cell carcinomas of the kidney. The mean age of diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma in VHL disease is 44 years, and 70% of patients who survive to age 60 develop renal cell carcinoma. The high risk of renal cell carcinoma mandates periodic surveillance (usually yearly in adults) by CT or MRI. Routine screening and awareness of the natural history of lesions has enabled renal-sparing approaches to disease management. Tumors <3 cm in size require careful monitoring for growth, whereas partial nephrectomy is indicated in those >3 cm in the absence of metastasis. Nonsurgical renal-sparing strategies, including percutaneous radio frequency ablation and selective arterial embolization, have shown promise in short-term trials.

Medullary Sponge Kidney

Pathology and Clinical Features

Medullary sponge kidney (MSK) is a relatively common benign condition of unknown cause characterized by ectasia of the papillary collecting ducts of one or both kidneys. Urinary stasis in the dilated ducts, hypocitraturia, and occasionally incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) contribute to the formation of small calcium-containing calculi. Most cases are asymptomatic or are discovered during investigation of hematuria. Symptomatic patients typically present as young adults with renal colic and nephrolithiasis or recurrent urinary tract infections; however, MSK also may affect children. Most cases are sporadic, although MSK has been found rarely in association with other congenital anomalies of the urinary tract and with congenital hepatic ductal ectasia (Caroli's disease).

Diagnosis

MSK is characteristically seen as hyperdense papillae with clusters of small stones on renal ultrasonography or abdominal x-ray (Fig. 284-2). The classical "paintbrush-like" features of MSK, representing the ectatic collecting ducts, are best seen on intravenous urography. However, this procedure has been supplanted by contrast-enhanced, high-resolution helical CT with digital reconstruction (Fig. 284-2).

Treatment: Medullary Sponge Kidney

No treatment is necessary in asymptomatic individuals, aside from maintaining high fluid intake to reduce the risk of nephrolithiasis. Recurrent stone formation should prompt a metabolic evaluation and treatment as in any stone former (Chap. 287). In patients with hypocitraturia and incomplete dRTA, treatment with potassium citrate helps prevent new stone formation. Urinary tract infections should be treated promptly.
 
Hereditary Disorders of Sodium, Potassium, and Magnesium Handling Without Hypertension

Inherited forms of hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia without hypertension are due to genetic mutations of various ion transporters and channels of the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (TAL) and distal convoluted tubule (DCT) (Table 284-2 and Fig. 284-3). In 1962 Bartter described two patients with a syndrome of metabolic alkalosis, hypovolemia, and failure to thrive associated with juxtaglomerular apparatus hyperplasia, hyperaldosteronism, and normal blood pressure. Subsequently, Gitelman identified a similar but milder syndrome accompanied by hypomagnesemia from urinary magnesium wasting and presenting in later childhood and adolescence. These disorders are now known to occur sporadically or result from genetically heterogeneous loss-of-function autosomal recessive mutations that cause salt-losing tubulopathy.

Bartter's Syndrome and Gitelman's Syndrome

Genetics and Pathogenesis

Bartter's syndrome may result from mutations affecting any of five ion transport proteins in the TAL. The proteins affected include the apical loop diuretic每sensitive sodium-potassium-chloride co-transporter NKCC2 (type 1), the apical potassium channel ROMK (type 2), and the basolateral chloride channel ClC-Kb (type 3). Bartter's type 4 results from mutations in barttin, an essential subunit of ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb that enables transport of the chloride channels to the cell surface. Barttin is also expressed in the inner ear; this accounts for the deafness invariably associated with Bartter's type 4. A Bartter-like phenotype (type 5) with associated hypocalcemia has been described in patients with autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutations in the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). Unregulated activation of this G protein每coupled receptor inhibits sodium reabsorption in the TAL. The TAL transporters function in an integrated manner to maintain both the electrical potential difference and the sodium gradient between the lumen and the cell (Fig. 284-3). Loss of the lumen-positive electrical transport potential that normally drives the paracellular reabsorption of sodium, calcium, and magnesium causes NaCl wasting, hypercalciuria, and mild hypomagnesemia. As expected, the clinical syndrome mimics the effects of chronic ingestion of a loop diuretic.

Gitelman's syndrome is due to mutations in the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl co-transporter, NCCT, in the DCT. Defects in NCCT in Gitelman's syndrome impair sodium and chloride reabsorption in the DCT (Fig. 284-3) and thus resemble the effects of thiazide diuretics. It remains unclear how this defect leads to severe magnesium wasting.

In both Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes, hypovolemia from impaired sodium and chloride reabsorption in either the TAL or the DCT activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The consequent hyperaldosteronism, together with increased distal flow and sodium delivery, stimulates increased sodium reabsorption in the collecting tubules via the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). This promotes increased potassium and hydrogen ion secretion, causing hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Additionally, in Bartter's syndrome, RAAS activation causes increased levels of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and marked overproduction of renal prostaglandins (PGE2), and this exacerbates the polyuria and electrolyte abnormalities.

Clinical Features

Bartter's Syndrome

Bartter's syndrome is a rare disease that most often presents in the neonatal period or early childhood with polyuria, polydipsia, salt craving, and growth retardation. Blood pressure is normal or low. Metabolic abnormalities include hypokalemia, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, decreased urinary concentrating and diluting ability, hypercalciuria with nephrocalcinosis, mild hypomagnesemia, and increased urinary prostaglandin excretion. Hyperprostaglandin E syndrome is a particularly severe form of Bartter's syndrome in which neonates present with pronounced volume depletion and failure to thrive, as well as fever, vomiting, and diarrhea from PGE2 overproduction. In the antenatal period, fetal polyuria may cause maternal polyhydramnios and premature labor. Sensorineural deafness occurs in patients with barttin gene mutations (type 4). Patients with severe Bartter's syndrome who survive early childhood may develop chronic kidney disease from nephrocalcinosis or from tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis from severe persistent hypokalemia. Patients with Bartter's syndrome type 3 have a phenotype intermediate between those of Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes, consistent with mutation of the ClC-Kb chloride channel in both the TAL and the DCT with preservation of the ClC-Ka chloride channel in the TAL. This disease occurs predominantly in African-American patients and resembles most closely the classic syndrome described by Bartter. Onset is generally later in childhood, patients have mild or no nephrocalcinosis, and prostaglandin excretion is normal.

Gitelman's Syndrome

Gitelman's syndrome is more common than Bartter's syndrome and has a generally milder clinical course with a later age of presentation. It is characterized by prominent neuromuscular symptoms and signs, including fatigue, weakness, carpopedal spasm, cramps, and tetany.

Diagnosis

Hypokalemia and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis without hypertension are more often due to surreptitious vomiting or diuretic abuse than to Bartter's or Gitelman's syndrome. In contrast to Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes, urinary chloride levels are very low in patients with surreptitious vomiting. Diuretic abuse can be diagnosed by screening the urine for the offending agents. Gitelman's syndrome is distinguished from most forms of Bartter's syndrome by the presence of severe hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria.

Treatment: Bartter's Syndrome and Gitelman's Syndrome

Both conditions require lifelong therapy with potassium and magnesium supplements and liberal salt intake. High doses of spironolactone or amiloride treat the hypokalemia, alkalosis, and magnesium wasting. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce the polyuria and salt wasting in Bartter's syndrome but are ineffective in Gitelman's syndrome. They may be lifesaving in hyperprostaglandin E syndrome and can be given in the form of a COX-2 inhibitor to avoid the gastrointestinal side effects of long-term high-dose NSAIDs. In Gitelman's syndrome, magnesium repletion is essential to correct the hypokalemia and control muscle weakness, tetany, and metabolic alkalosis; however, it may prove difficult in patients wasting large amounts of magnesium.

Pseudohypoaldosteronism Type 1

Patients with type 1 pseudohypoaldosteronism present with severe renal salt wasting and hyperkalemia. Although these findings resemble mineralocorticoid deficiency, plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels are elevated. Defective salt handling is the result of autosomal recessive loss-of-function mutations of the , , or  subunit of the ENaC or autosomal dominant mutations of one allele of the mineralocorticoid receptor (Table 284-2 and Fig. 284-3). The autosomal recessive form is a multisystem disorder with a severe phenotype, often manifesting in the neonatal period with renal salt wasting, vomiting, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, and failure to thrive. Impaired channel activity in the skin and lungs can produce excess sodium and chloride loss in sweat, excess fluid in the airways, and a propensity for lower respiratory tract infections that mimic cystic fibrosis. In contrast, the autosomal dominant form has a more benign course that is limited mainly to renal salt wasting and hyperkalemia. Aggressive salt replacement and management of hyperkalemia can lead to survival into adulthood, and symptoms may become less severe with time, especially in the dominant form. In the latter, high-dose fludrocortisone or carbenoxolone provides additional benefit by increasing mineralocorticoid activity and partly restoring the functional defect in the mutant receptor.

Magnesium Wasting Disorders

In addition to Gitelman's syndrome, several hereditary disorders cause urinary magnesium wasting (Table 284-2 and Fig. 284-3). These disorders include autosomal recessive familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC), autosomal recessive hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH), autosomal dominant hypomagnesemia, autosomal dominant hypoparathyroidism, and isolated autosomal recessive hypomagnesemia (Chap. 353). Common clinical features are the early onset of spasms, tetany, and seizures as well as associated or secondary disturbances in calcium homeostasis.

Familial Hypomagnesemia with Hypercalciuria and Nephrocalcinosis

FHHNC is the first example of a disorder attributable to a defective protein involved in paracellular ion transport. CLDCN16 encodes claudin 16 (previously known as paracellin-1), a member of the claudin family of proteins that are involved in tight junction formation. Claudin 16 is expressed in the TAL of Henle's loop and the DCT. Claudin 16 is thought to be an essential component of the paracellular pathway for Mg, and Ca to a lesser extent, reabsorption in the TAL. Clinical manifestations begin in infancy and include hypomagnesemia that is refractory to oral supplementation, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis. Recurrent urinary tract infections and nephrolithiasis have also been observed. Patients with mutations of claudin 19 have a similar phenotype but also manifest ocular defects, including corneal calcifications and chorioretinitis.

Hypomagnesemia with Secondary Hypocalcemia

Hypomagnesemia in HSH results from a defect in the TRPM6 channel, a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of cation transport channels. TRPM6 is expressed in intestinal epithelia and the DCT and is thought to mediate transepithelial magnesium transport. Symptoms are attributable to hypomagnesemia with secondary impairment of parathyroid function and hypocalcemia. Seizures and muscle spasms occur in infancy, and restoration of magnesium and calcium levels requires high doses of oral magnesium supplementation.

Other Hereditary Hypomagnesemic Disorders

Mutations of the sodium-potassium-ATPase  subunit can cause an autosomal dominant hypomagnesemia. Activating mutations of the CaSR in autosomal dominant hypoparathyroidism primarily manifest as hypocalcemia, but hypomagnesemia has been reported in 50% of these patients. Mutations in epidermal growth factor (EGF) result in isolated autosomal recessive hypomagnesemia due to impaired activation of the EGF receptor and consequent failure to activate TRPM6.
 
Hereditary Tubular Disorders Causing Hypertension Due to Salt Retention

Liddle's Syndrome

Liddle's syndrome mimics a state of aldosterone excess by the presence of early and severe hypertension, often accompanied by hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, but plasma aldosterone and renin levels are low. This disorder is due to unregulated sodium reabsorption by an overactive ENaC in the cortical collecting duct (Fig. 284-3). Deletional mutations of the intracellular domain of the  or  subunit of ENaC (Table 284-2) prevent binding of the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 that normally targets the channel for proteasomal degradation. This results in an inability to downregulate the number of channels despite a high intracellular sodium concentration. Increased potassium and hydrogen ion secretion follow the lumen-negative electrical potential that results from chloride-independent sodium reabsorption. Amiloride or triamterene blocks ENaC and, combined with salt restriction, provides effective therapy for the hypertension and hypokalemia.

Pseudohypoaldosteronism Type II (Familial Hyperkalemic Hypertension; Gordon's Syndrome)

Pseudohypoaldosteronism type II is a rare autosomal dominant disease that manifests in adolescence or early adulthood with thiazide-responsive low-renin hypertension, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis with normal renal function. Mutations have been identified in the WNK kinases 1 and 4 that lead to increased activity of the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride channel, NCCT. This causes hypertension from enhanced salt reabsorption in the DCT and impaired distal secretion of potassium and hydrogen ion, all of which can be corrected with thiazide diuretics.
 
Inherited Disorders of Water Handling

Hereditary Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus

Hereditary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare monogenic disease that usually presents in infancy with severe vasopressin-resistant polyuria, dehydration, failure to thrive, and dilute urine despite the presence of hypernatremia.

Genetics and Pathogenesis

Vasopressin [antidiuretic hormone (ADH)]-stimulated water reabsorption in the collecting duct is mediated by the type 2 vasopressin receptor (V2R) on the basal surface of principal cells. Activation of the adenylyl cyclase每cAMP pathway phosphorylates vesicle-associated aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channels and stimulates their insertion into the apical plasma membrane. Water enters the cells from the tubular lumen through AQP2 and exits along an osmotic gradient into the hypertonic medulla and vasa rectae via basal AQP3/4 channels (Fig. 284-3). X-linked mutations of AVPR2, the gene that encodes V2R, account for about 90% of cases of hereditary NDI, such that the expression of the receptor on the cell surface is impaired. The remaining cases are due to various autosomal recessive or dominant mutations of AQP2 that cause the water channels to be retained within the cytosol (Table 284-2). The effect of these mutations is an inability to concentrate the urine and conserve water despite high plasma levels of vasopressin. Penetrance is variable in heterozygous female carriers of X-linked NDI, and some have a moderate concentrating defect that may be exacerbated in pregnancy due to placental vasopressinase.

Clinical Features

Whereas NDI in adults is most often acquired from lithium therapy, hypercalcemia, and partial chronic urinary obstruction, hereditary NDI typically presents in infancy. Unlike other polyuric syndromes such as Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes, conservation of electrolytes is normal, and hypernatremia is entirely from the loss of water. Recurrent episodes of dehydration and hypernatremia can lead to seizures and mental retardation. Although renal function is otherwise normal, chronically high urine flow causes dilation of the ureters and bladder and may cause bladder dysfunction and obstructive uropathy.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis in infants and children with hereditary NDI is usually apparent from the family history and clinical presentation. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the presence of high plasma levels of vasopressin in the face of polyuria and hypotonic urine. This may be especially useful in adults with partial NDI to distinguish the polyuric state from central diabetes insipidus or psychogenic polydipsia (Chap. 340). Genetic screening for mutations in AVPR2 and AQP2 is available in research centers and can be performed to identify affected infants from families at risk of NDI to begin treatment and avoid dehydration and its consequences.

Treatment: Hereditary Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus

Early diagnosis and treatment with abundant water intake have enabled many patients to live to adulthood with normal mental and physical development. Exogenous vasopressin is ineffective, and because these patients can excrete up to 20 L of urine per day, maintaining adequate water intake is challenging. Thiazide diuretics and salt restriction can reduce urine output by inducing a state of mild volume contraction, thereby promoting increased proximal reabsorption of isotonic fluid and inhibiting the delivery of free water to the collecting duct. A combination thiazide-amiloride formulation will avoid thiazide-induced hypokalemia, and indomethacin may further reduce urine output by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.

Nephrogenic Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuresis

Activating mutations of the V2R result in hyponatremia, inappropriately elevated urinary osmolality, and undetectable arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels in affected males. This syndrome results from missense mutations of AVPR2 on the X chromosome, which cause constitutive activation of V2R and inappropriate water reabsorption. Heterozygous female carriers may be at risk of hyponatremia when exposed to large volumes of hypotonic fluids.
 
Inherited Renal Tubular Acidosis

Non-anion-gap (hyperchloremic) metabolic acidosis from proximal tubular bicarbonate wasting or impaired distal net acid excretion may be a primary (sporadic or inherited) tubular disorder or may be acquired secondary to a variety of conditions (Chap. 47). There are three forms of renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Types 1 and 2 may be acquired or primary, whereas the most common form, type 4 RTA, usually is acquired in association with moderate renal dysfunction and is characterized by hyperkalemia.

Type 1 (Distal) Rta

Clinical Features and Diagnosis

In distal RTA the kidneys are unable to acidify the urine to pH <5.5 in the presence of systemic metabolic acidosis or after acid loading as a result of impaired hydrogen ion secretion or bicarbonate reabsorption in the distal nephron. Other features include hypokalemia, hypocitraturia, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and/or nephrolithiasis. Chronic untreated acidosis may cause rickets or osteomalacia. Inheritance of primary dRTA includes autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms with a broad spectrum of clinical expression. Autosomal recessive dRTA most often presents in infancy with severe acidosis, failure to thrive, impaired growth, and impaired kidney function from nephrocalcinosis. Many patients with autosomal dominant dRTA, and some with recessive disease, are asymptomatic, and RTA is discovered incidentally in adolescence or adulthood during evaluation for kidney stones. In the absence of systemic acidosis, the diagnosis of incomplete dRTA is suggested by hypocitraturia and hypercalciuria and can be confirmed by failure of the urine to acidify to pH <5.5 after acid loading.

Genetics and Pathophysiology

Primary dRTA may be hereditary or sporadic with autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant forms. Several kindreds with autosomal recessive dRTA have been identified in Southeast Asia and in areas of the world where parental consanguinity is high. The cellular basis for dRTA lies in dysfunction at the level of the  type intercalated cell of the cortical collecting duct (Fig. 284-3). Mutations affecting subunits of the H+-ATPase proton pump on the luminal surface impair hydrogen ion secretion and account for most forms of autosomal recessive dRTA and are often associated with early-onset sensorineural hearing loss (Table 284-2). Autosomal dominant dRTA results from mutations involving the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger, AE1, on the basolateral membrane. Anion exchange by the mutant AE1 is normal, but aberrant targeting of AE1 from the basal to the apical plasma membrane is believed to cause bicarbonate loss into the urine instead of reabsorption. Bi-allelic mutations of AE1 may impair transport activity and account for some cases of recessive disease (Table 284-2). A syndrome of osteopetrosis, short stature, and mental retardation, so-called marble-brain disease with dRTA, is due to mutations in carbonic anhydrase II. Urinary potassium wasting and defective urinary concentration are characteristic of dRTA. Calcium is released from bone in the process of buffering of acid and results in hypercalciuria. Enhanced proximal citrate absorption accounts for hypocitraturia and, together with hypercalciuria, predisposes to nephrocalcinosis and formation of calcium phosphate stones.

Treatment: Type 1 (Distal) Rta

Early initiation of alkali replacement at doses equivalent to 1每3 mmol/kg per day of bicarbonate in divided doses will usually correct the acidosis, hypokalemia, and hypocitraturia, maintaining growth and preventing bone disease in early-onset dRTA. Citrate is generally tolerated better than sodium bicarbonate and can be given as the potassium or sodium salt, depending on the severity of hypokalemia. In patients who present later with kidney stones, large fluid intake and sufficient alkali to restore normal acid-base balance correct the hypocitraturia and reduce hypercalciuria, thereby inhibiting the formation of new stones.

Type 2 (Proximal) Rta

Proximal RTA (pRTA) is the result of impaired bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubule, where the bulk of filtered bicarbonate is recovered (Fig. 284-3). It is most often secondary to various autoimmune, drug-induced, infiltrative, or other tubulopathies (Chap. 47) or results from tubular injury from inherited diseases in which endogenous metabolites accumulate and produce tubular injury. Such inherited disorders include Wilson's disease, cystinosis, tyrosinemia, galactosemia, hereditary fructose intolerance, glycogen storage disease type I, and Lowe's syndrome. In this situation pRTA is only one of several abnormalities that constitute Fanconi syndrome. Other features are hyperphosphaturia, hyperuricosuria, hypercalciuria, nonselective aminoaciduria, and glycosuria. In addition to hyperchloremic acidosis, rickets and osteomalacia are the predominant effects of Fanconi syndrome.

A rare infantile form of primary pRTA with isolated proximal tubular bicarbonate wasting is due to homozygous mutations of the proximal tubule basolateral sodium-bicarbonate co-transporter NBC1 (Table 284-2). This co-transporter is the main mechanism by which bicarbonate moves from the proximal tubule cell back into the blood. Other manifestations include short stature and mental retardation. An ocular phenotype that includes bilateral glaucoma, cataracts, and band keratopathy reflects a role of NBC1 in maintaining normal fluid balance in the eye and clarity of the lens.

Treatment: Type 2 (Proximal) Rta

It is difficult to restore normal acid-base balance in patients with pRTA despite large amounts of alkali. This is the case because they continue to waste bicarbonate (fractional excretion >15%) until the serum level falls below a threshold, usually about 15每17 mmol/L, at which time bicarbonate is completely reabsorbed distally and the urine is maximally acidified with pH <5.5. When the serum bicarbonate concentration is raised above the threshold with alkali therapy, bicarbonate wasting recurs and causes hypokalemia as potassium is secreted to maintain luminal electroneutrality. Thus, treatment of pRTA requires 5每15 mmol/kg per day of bicarbonate together with supplemental potassium.
 
Other Monogenic Disorders of Proximal Tubular Function (Fig. 284-3)

Cystinuria

Cystinuria is an autosomal recessive disorder of cystine and dibasic amino acid (ornithine, arginine, and lysine) transport in the proximal tubule and intestinal epithelial cells. With a prevalence of about 1 in 10,000, it represents one of the more common heritable diseases. Impaired tubular absorption leads to high concentrations of cystine, which is insoluble in the acid environment of the renal tubules. Clinical severity varies from asymptomatic cystine crystalluria in heterozygous carriers to the frequent passage of gravel and cystine stones, ureteral obstruction, recurrent urinary infections, formation of staghorn calculi, and progressive kidney failure in homozygotes. The median onset of nephrolithiasis is 12 years. The disease is due to mutations in one of two genes, SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 (Table 284-2). SLC3A1 encodes rBAT, a high-affinity, sodium-independent transporter for dibasic amino acids. The protein product of SLC7A9, b0,+AT, is a catalytic subunit that associates with rBAT to form the active transporter. Diagnosis of cystinuria is established by a positive family history, the finding of hexagonal cystine crystals on urinalysis, and 24-h urinary cystine excretion that exceeds 400 mg (normal less than 30 mg/d).

Treatment: Cystinuria

The mainstay of treatment is hydration to achieve a urine output of 2.5 L/d or more to reduce urine cystine concentration to <300 mg/L, together with urine alkalinization to pH 7.0每7.5 with potassium citrate, and sodium restriction. Cystine is an oxidized dimer that is formed by linking two cysteine residues via a disulfide bond between the -SH groups. Thus, in intractable cases, thiol derivatives such as penicillamine, tiopronin, and captopril may be added as chelation therapy to dissociate the cystine molecule into more soluble disulfide compounds. Various stone removal and urinary drainage procedures are often required.

Hartnup Disease

Hartnup disease is an autosomal recessive condition caused by a defect in intestinal and renal transport of neutral amino acids. The major clinical manifestations are cerebellar ataxia and a pellagra-like skin rash. Other than aminoaciduria, the kidneys are unaffected. The defective gene, SLC6A19, encodes a sodium-dependent and chloride-independent neutral amino acid transporter (BoAT1), which is expressed predominately in the small intestine and proximal tubule of the kidney (Table 284-2). Amino acids such as tryptophan that are retained in the intestinal lumen are converted to indole compounds that are toxic to the CNS. Abnormal tryptophan metabolism also leads to a niacin deficiency that accounts for the skin manifestations. Symptoms are aggravated by a protein-deficient diet and are alleviated with a high-protein diet and nicotinamide supplements.

Dent's Disease

Dent's disease and X-linked recessive nephrolithiasis are unusual forms of Fanconi syndrome due to X-linked mutations of the gene encoding CLC-5, a voltage-gated chloride channel (Table 284-2). The disorders are characterized by childhood onset of low-molecular-weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and nephrolithiasis. Rickets or osteomalacia occurs in 25% of patients, and progressive renal failure from interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and glomerulosclerosis commonly develops in adulthood. CLC-5 serves to maintain the electrical gradient and acid environment established in proximal tubular cell endosomes by proton-ATPase, which is necessary for the degradation of low-molecular-weight proteins normally filtered by the glomerulus. Defects in CLC-5 appear to disrupt this process and lead to tubular cell dysfunction.

Treatment: Dent's Disease

Treatment is directed at controlling hypercalciuria by dietary salt restriction and thiazide diuretics, which favor calcium reabsorption. Restriction of dietary calcium is not recommended.

Cystinosis

Cystinosis is a rare multisystem autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations of cystinosin, a hydrogen ion每driven transporter responsible for exporting cystine from lysosomes. Accumulation of insoluble cystine leads to crystal formation in proximal tubular cells and other organs. Cystinosis occurs in infantile (nephropathic), adolescent, and adult forms. The nephropathic form is the most common, with clinical signs developing between 3 and 6 months of age, including Fanconi syndrome, salt and water wasting, growth retardation, rickets, vomiting, constipation, and unexplained fever. End-stage renal disease occurs by age 10 in the infantile form of the disease but after age 15 in the intermediate form. Extrarenal manifestations result from cystine accumulation in organs and include photophobia and blindness, muscular weakness from carnitine deficiency, hepatomegaly, hypothyroidism, delayed pubertal development, and late-onset neurologic disease. The adult form of cystinosis is largely asymptomatic except for photophobia. The diagnosis is made by measuring elevated cystine content of peripheral blood leukocytes.

Treatment: Cystinosis

Treatment includes replacement of fluid and electrolyte losses related to Fanconi syndrome and polyuria. l-Carnitine supplementation is recommended to achieve normal plasma carnitine levels. Cysteamine provides a direct treatment of the disease that converts cystine to cysteine, which can exit the lysosome. Cysteamine should be started promptly upon the diagnosis of cystinosis as it preserves kidney function, prevents hypothyroidism, and improves growth. Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for ESRD as cystinosis does not recur in transplanted kidneys, but the extrarenal manifestations persist and may progress.

Renal Glucosuria

Isolated glucosuria in the presence of a normal blood glucose concentration is due to mutations in SLC5A2, the gene that encodes the high-capacity sodium-glucose co-transporter SGLT2 in the proximal renal tubule (Table 284-2). Subjects with this disorder are usually asymptomatic and do not have other features of proximal tubular dysfunction. Depending on the severity of the defect, the tubular maximum for glucose reabsorption may fall well within normal blood glucose levels and lead to >50 g/d of glucosuria. Such patients may have polyuria from osmotic diuresis.

Renal Phosphate Wasting

Renal phosphate wasting resulting in hypophosphatemia and rickets or osteomalacia may be part of a generalized disorder of proximal tubular function, as in Fanconi syndrome, or an isolated phenomenon. Isolated phosphaturia is most often due to the inhibition of renal tubular phosphate reabsorption by one or another phosphaturic hormone, with FGF-23 playing a major role (Chap. 352). An exception is hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH), an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in SLC34A3, the gene encoding the proximal tubule sodium-phosphate co-transporter, NPT-2c (Table 284-2). Defective phosphate reabsorption causes renal phosphate wasting and stunted growth from rickets. The low serum phosphorus levels stimulate 1-hydroxylation of vitamin D, which increases intestinal calcium absorption, suppresses parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, and results in hypercalciuria. High levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D help distinguish HHRH from hormonal causes of hyperphosphaturia (Chap. 352). Treatment is directed at phosphate repletion.

Vitamin D每Dependent Rickets

Vitamin D每dependent rickets exists in two forms that manifest with hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, elevated PTH levels, and the skeletal abnormalities of rickets and osteomalacia. Tetany may be present in severe cases. Vitamin D每dependent rickets type I is an autosomal recessive disease that results from mutations in CYP27B1, the gene that encodes 25(OH)D3-1-hydroxylase, an enzyme in the proximal tubule that catalyzes the hydroxylation and activation of 25(OH)D3 into 1,25(OH)2D3 (Table 284-2). It can be treated with physiologic replacement doses of 1,25(OH)2D3. In contrast, autosomal recessive vitamin D每dependent rickets type II is due to end organ resistance to 1,25(OH)2D3 as a result of mutations in the vitamin D receptor (Chap. 353).

Tubulointerstitial Diseases of the Kidney: Introduction

Inflammation or fibrosis of the renal interstitium and atrophy of the tubular compartment are common consequences of diseases that target the glomeruli or vasculature. Distinct from these secondary phenomena, however, are a group of disorders that primarily affect the tubules and interstitium, with relative sparing of the glomeruli and renal vessels. Such disorders are conveniently divided into acute and chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) (Table 285-1).

Acute TIN most often presents with acute renal failure (Chap. 279). The acute nature of this group of disorders may be caused by aggressive inflammatory infiltrates that lead to tissue edema, tubular cell injury, and compromised tubular flow, or by frank obstruction of the tubules with casts, cellular debris, or crystals. There is sometimes flank pain due to distention of the renal capsule. Urinary sediment is often active with leukocytes and cellular casts, but depends on the exact nature of the disorder in question.

The clinical features of chronic TIN are more indolent and may manifest with disorders of tubular function, including polyuria from impaired concentrating ability (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), defective proximal tubular reabsorption leading to features of Fanconi syndrome [glycosuria, phosphaturia, aminoaciduria, hypokalemia- and type II renal tubular acidosis (RTA) from bicarbonaturia], or non-anion-gap metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia (type IV RTA) due to impaired ammoniagenesis, as well as progressive azotemia [rising creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)]. There is often modest proteinuria (rarely >2 g/d) attributable to decreased tubular reabsorption of filtered proteins; however, nephrotic-range albuminuria may occur in some conditions due to the development of secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Renal ultrasonography may reveal changes of "medical renal disease," such as increased echogenicity of the renal parenchyma with loss of corticomedullary differentiation, prominence of the renal pyramids, and cortical scarring in some conditions. The predominant pathology in chronic TIN is interstitial fibrosis with patchy mononuclear cell infiltration and widespread tubular atrophy, luminal dilation, and thickening of tubular basement membranes. Because of the nonspecific nature of the histopathology, biopsy specimens rarely provide a specific diagnosis. Thus, diagnosis relies on careful analysis of history, drug or toxin exposure, associated symptoms, and imaging studies.
 
Acute Interstitial Nephritis

In 1897 Councilman reported on eight cases of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) in the Medical and Surgical Reports of the Boston City Hospital; three as a postinfectious complication of scarlet fever and two from diphtheria. Later, he described the lesion as "an acute inflammation of the kidney characterized by cellular and fluid exudation in the interstitial tissue, accompanied by, but not dependant on, degeneration of the epithelium; the exudation is not purulent in character, and the lesions may be both diffuse and focal." Today AIN is far more often encountered as an allergic reaction to a drug (Table 285-1). Immune-mediated AIN may also occur as part of a known autoimmune syndrome, but in some cases there is no identifiable cause despite features suggestive of an immunological etiology (Table 285-1).

Allergic Interstitial Nephritis

Although biopsy-proven AIN accounts for no more than ~15% of cases of unexplained acute renal failure, this is likely a substantial underestimate of the true incidence. This is because potentially offending medications are more often identified and empirically discontinued in a patient noted to have a rising serum creatinine, without the benefit of a renal biopsy to establish the diagnosis of AIN.

Clinical Features

The classic presentation of AIN, namely, fever, rash, peripheral eosinophilia, and oliguric renal failure occurring after 7每10 days of treatment with methicillin or another -lactam antibiotic is the exception rather than the rule. More often, patients are found incidentally to have a rising serum creatinine or present with symptoms attributable to acute renal failure (Chap. 279). Atypical reactions can occur; most notably nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced AIN, in which fever, rash and eosinophilia are rare, but acute renal failure with heavy proteinuria is common. A particularly severe and rapid-onset AIN may occur upon reintroduction of rifampin after a drug-free period. More insidious reactions to the agents listed in Table 285-1 may lead to progressive tubulointerstitial damage. Examples include proton pump inhibitors and, rarely, sulfonamide and 5-aminosalicylate (mesalazine and sulfasalazine) derivatives and antiretrovirals.

Diagnosis

Finding otherwise unexplained renal failure with or without oliguria and exposure to a potentially offending agent usually points to the diagnosis. Peripheral blood eosinophilia adds supporting evidence but is present in only a minority of patients. Urinalysis reveals pyuria with white blood cell casts and hematuria. Urinary eosinophils are neither sensitive nor specific for AIN; therefore, testing is not recommended. Renal biopsy is generally not required for diagnosis but reveals extensive interstitial and tubular infiltration of leukocytes, including eosinophils.

Treatment: Allergic Interstitial Nephritis

Discontinuation of the offending agent often leads to reversal of the renal injury. However, depending on the duration of exposure and degree of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis that has occurred, the renal damage may not be completely reversible. Glucocorticoid therapy may accelerate renal recovery, but does not appear to impact long-term renal survival. It is best reserved for those cases with severe renal failure in which dialysis is imminent or if renal function continues to deteriorate despite stopping the offending drug (Fig. 285-1 and Table 285-2).

Sj?gren's Syndrome

Sj?gren's syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disorder that primarily targets the exocrine glands, especially the lacrimal and salivary glands, and thus results in symptoms, such as dry eyes and mouth, that constitute the "sicca syndrome" (Chap. 324). Tubulointerstitial nephritis with a predominant lymphocytic infiltrate is the most common renal manifestation of Sj?gren's syndrome and can be associated with distal RTA, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and moderate renal failure. Diagnosis is strongly supported by positive serologic testing for anti-Ro (SS-A) and anti-La (SS-B) antibodies. A large proportion of patients with Sj?gren's syndrome also have polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Treatment is initially with glucocorticoids, although patients may require maintenance therapy with azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil to prevent relapse (Fig. 285-1 and Table 285-2).

Tubulointerstitial Nephritis with Uveitis (Tinu)

TINU is a systemic autoimmune disease of unknown etiology. It accounts for fewer than 5% of all cases of AIN, affects females three times more often than males, and has a median age of onset of 15 years. Its hallmark feature, in addition to a lymphocyte-predominant interstitial nephritis (Fig. 285-2), is a painful anterior uveitis, often bilateral and accompanied by blurred vision and photophobia. Diagnosis is often confounded by the fact that the ocular symptoms precede or accompany the renal disease in only one-third of cases. Additional extrarenal features include fever, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain, and arthralgia. The presence of such symptoms as well as elevated creatinine, sterile pyuria, mild proteinuria, features of the Fanconi syndrome, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate should raise suspicion for this disorder. Serologies suggestive of the more common autoimmune diseases are usually negative, and TINU is often a diagnosis of exclusion after other causes of uveitis and renal disease, such as Sj?gren's syndrome, Beh?et's disease, sarcoidosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, have been considered. Clinical symptoms are typically self-limited in children, but are more apt to follow a relapsing course in adults. The renal and ocular manifestations generally respond well to oral glucocorticoids, although maintenance therapy with agents such as methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate may be necessary to prevent relapses (Fig. 285-1 and Table 285-2).

Both the iritis and AIN improved after intravenous methylprednisolone. This PAS-stained renal biopsy shows a mononuclear cell interstitial infiltrate (asterisks) and edema separating the tubules (T) and a normal glomerulus (G). Some of the tubules contain cellular debris and infiltrating inflammatory cells. The findings in this biopsy are indistinguishable from those that would be seen in a case of drug-induced AIN. PAS, Periodic acid每Schiff.
 
 

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

An interstitial mononuclear cell inflammatory reaction often accompanies the glomerular lesion in most cases of class III or IV lupus nephritis (Chap. 283), and deposits of immune complexes can be identified in tubule basement membranes in about 50%. Occasionally, however, the tubulointerstitial inflammation predominates and may manifest with azotemia and type IV RTA rather than features of glomerulonephritis.

Granulomatous Interstitial Nephritis

Some patients may present with features of AIN but follow a protracted and relapsing course. Renal biopsy in such patients reveals a more chronic inflammatory infiltrate with granulomas and multinucleated giant cells. Most often, no associated disease or cause is found; however, some of these cases may have or subsequently develop the pulmonary, cutaneous, or other systemic manifestations of sarcoidosis such as hypercalcemia. Most patients experience some improvement in renal function if treated early with glucocorticoids before the development of significant interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (Table 285-2). Other immunosuppressive agents may be required for those who relapse frequently upon steroid withdrawal (Fig. 285-1). Tuberculosis should be ruled out before starting treatment because this too is a rare cause of granulomatous interstitial nephritis.

Igg4-Related Systemic Disease

A form of AIN characterized by a dense inflammatory infiltrate containing IgG4-expressing plasma cells can occur as a part of a recently described syndrome known as IgG4-related systemic disease. Autoimmune pancreatitis, sclerosing cholangitis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, and a chronic sclerosing sialadenitis (mimicking Sj?gren's syndrome) may variably be present as well. Fibrotic lesions that form pseudotumors in the affected organs soon replace the initial inflammatory infiltrates and often lead to biopsy or excision for fear of true malignancy. Although the involvement of IgG4 in the pathogenesis is not understood, glucocorticoids have been successfully used as first-line treatment in this group of disorders, once they are correctly diagnosed.

Idiopathic Ain

Some patients present with typical clinical and histologic features of AIN but have no evidence of drug exposure or clinical or serologic features of an autoimmune disease. The presence in some cases of autoantibodies to a tubular antigen, similar to that identified in rats with an induced form of interstitial nephritis, suggests that an autoimmune response may be involved. Like TINU and granulomatous interstitial nephritis, idiopathic AIN is responsive to glucocorticoid therapy but may follow a relapsing course requiring maintenance treatment with another immunosuppressive agent (Fig. 285-1 and Table 285-2).

Infection-Associated Ain

AIN may also occur as a local inflammatory reaction to microbial infection (Table 285-1) and should be distinguished from acute bacterial pyelonephritis (Chap. 288). Acute bacterial pyelonephritis does not generally cause acute renal failure unless it affects both kidneys or causes septic shock. Presently, infection-associated AIN is most often seen in immunocompromised patients, particularly renal transplant recipients with reactivation of polyomavirus BK (Chaps. 132 and 282).

Crystal Deposition Disorders and Obstructive Tubulopathies

Acute renal failure may occur when crystals of various types are deposited in tubular cells and interstitium or when they obstruct tubules. Oliguric acute renal failure, often accompanied by flank pain from tubular obstruction, may occur in patients treated with sulfadiazine for toxoplasmosis, indinavir for HIV, and intravenous acyclovir for severe herpesvirus infections. Urinalysis reveals "sheaf of wheat" sulfonamide crystals, individual or parallel clusters of needle-shaped indinavir crystals, or red-green birefringement needle-shaped crystals of acyclovir. This adverse effect is generally precipitated by hypovolemia and is reversible with saline volume repletion and drug withdrawal. Distinct from the obstructive disease, a frank AIN from indinavir crystal deposition has also been reported.

Acute tubular obstruction is also the cause of oliguric renal failure in patients with acute urate nephropathy. It typically results from severe hyperuricemia from tumor lysis syndrome in patients with lympho- or myeloproliferative disorders treated with cytotoxic agents, but also may occur spontaneously before the treatment has been initiated (Chap. 276). Uric acid crystallization in the tubules and collecting system leads to partial or complete obstruction of the collecting ducts, renal pelvis, or ureter. A dense precipitate of birefringent uric acid crystals is found in the urine, usually in association with microscopic or gross hematuria. Prophylactic allopurinol reduces the risk of uric acid nephropathy but is of no benefit once tumor lysis has occurred. Once oliguria has developed, attempts to increase tubular flow and solubility of uric acid with alkaline diuresis may be of some benefit; however, emergent treatment with hemodialysis or rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase, is usually required to rapidly lower uric acid levels and restore renal function.

Calcium oxalate crystal deposition in tubular cells and interstitium may lead to permanent renal dysfunction in patients who survive ethylene glycol intoxication, in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria from ileal resection or small-bowel bypass surgery, and in patients with hereditary hyperoxaluria (Chap. 287). Acute phosphate nephropathy is an uncommon but serious complication of oral Phospho-soda used as a laxative or for bowel preparation for colonoscopy. It is the result of calcium phosphate crystal deposition in tubules and interstitium and occurs especially in subjects with underlying renal impairment and hypovolemia. Consequently, Phospho-soda should be avoided in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Light Chain Cast Nephropathy

Patients with multiple myeloma may develop acute renal failure in the setting of hypovolemia, infection, or hypercalcemia or after exposure to NSAIDs or radiographic contrast media. The diagnosis of light chain cast nephropathy (LCCN)〞commonly known as myeloma kidney〞should be considered in patients who fail to recover when the precipitating factor is corrected or in any elderly patient with otherwise unexplained acute renal failure.

In this disorder, filtered monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains (Bence-Jones proteins) form intratubular aggregates with secreted Tamm-Horsfall protein in the distal tubule. Casts, in addition to obstructing the tubular flow in affected nephrons, incite a giant cell or foreign body reaction and can lead to tubular rupture, resulting in interstitial fibrosis (Fig. 285-3). Although LCCN generally occurs in patients with known multiple myeloma and a large plasma cell burden, the disorder should also be considered as a possible diagnosis in patients who have known monoclonal gammopathy even in the absence of frank myeloma. Filtered monoclonal light chains may also cause less pronounced renal manifestations in the absence of obstruction, due to direct toxicity to proximal tubular cells and intracellular crystal formation. This may result in isolated tubular disorders such as RTA or the full Fanconi syndrome.

Diagnosis

Clinical clues to the diagnosis include anemia, bone pain, hypercalcemia, and an abnormally narrow anion gap due to hypoalbuminemia and hypergammaglobulinemia. Urinary dipsticks detect albumin but not immunoglobulin light chains; however, laboratory detection of increased amounts of protein in a spot urine specimen and a negative dipstick result are highly suggestive that the urine contains Bence-Jones protein. Serum and urine should both be sent for protein electrophoresis and for immunofixation for the detection and identification of a potential monoclonal band. A sensitive method is now clinically available to detect urine and serum free light chains.

Treatment: Light Chain Cast Nephropathy

The goals of treatment are to correct precipitating factors such as hypovolemia and hypercalcemia, discontinue potential nephrotoxic agents, and treat the underlying plasma cell dyscrasia (Chap. 111); plasmapheresis to remove light chains is of questionable value for LCCN.

Lymphomatous Infiltration of the Kidney

Interstitial infiltration by malignant B lymphocytes is a common autopsy finding in patients dying of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; however, this is usually an incidental finding. Rarely, such infiltrates may cause massive enlargement of the kidneys and oliguric acute renal failure. Although high-dose glucocorticoids and subsequent chemotherapy often results in recovery of renal function, the prognosis in such cases is generally poor.
 
Chronic Tubulointerstitial Diseases

Improved occupational and public health measures, together with the banning of over-the-counter phenacetin-containing analgesics, has led to a dramatic decline in the incidence of chronic interstitial nephritis (CIN) from heavy metal〞particularly lead and cadmium〞exposure and analgesic nephropathy in North America. Today, CIN is most often the result of renal ischemia or secondary to a primary glomerular disease (Chap. 283). Other important forms of CIN are the result of developmental anomalies or inherited diseases such as reflux nephropathy or sickle cell nephropathy and may not be recognized until adolescence or adulthood. Whereas it is impossible to reverse damage that has already occurred, further deterioration may be prevented or at least slowed in such cases by treating glomerular hypertension, a common denominator in the development of secondary FSGS and progressive loss of functioning nephrons. Therefore, awareness and early detection of patients at risk may prevent them from developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Vesicoureteral Reflux and Reflux Nephropathy

Reflux nephropathy is the consequence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) or other urologic anomalies in early childhood. It was previously called chronic pyelonephritis because it was believed to result from recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in childhood. VUR stems from abnormal retrograde urine flow from the bladder into one or both ureters and kidneys because of mislocated and incompetent ureterovesical valves (Fig. 285-4). Although high-pressure sterile reflux may impair normal growth of the kidneys, when coupled with recurrent UTIs in early childhood, the result is patchy interstitial scarring and tubular atrophy. Loss of functioning nephrons leads to hypertrophy of the remnant glomeruli and eventual secondary FSGS. Reflux nephropathy often goes unnoticed until early adulthood when chronic kidney disease is detected during routine evaluation or during pregnancy. Affected adults are frequently asymptomatic, but may give a history of prolonged bed-wetting or recurrent UTIs during childhood, and exhibit variable renal insufficiency, hypertension, mild to moderate proteinuria, and unremarkable urine sediment. When both kidneys are affected, the disease often progresses inexorably over several years to end-stage kidney disease, despite the absence of ongoing urinary infections or reflux. A single affected kidney may go undetected, except for the presence of hypertension. Renal ultrasound in adults characteristically shows asymmetric small kidneys with irregular outlines, thinned cortices, and regions of compensatory hypertrophy (Fig. 285-4).

Treatment: Vesicoureteral Reflux and Reflux Nephropathy

Maintenance of a sterile urine in childhood has been shown to limit scarring of the kidneys. Surgical reimplantation of the ureters into the bladder to restore competency is indicated in young children with persistent high-grade reflux but is ineffective and is not indicated in adolescents or adults after scarring has occurred. Aggressive control of blood pressure with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and other agents is effective in reducing proteinuria and may significantly forestall further deterioration of renal function.

Sickle Cell Nephropathy

The pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of sickle cell nephropathy are described in Chap. 286. Evidence of tubular injury may be evident in childhood and early adolescence in the form of polyuria due to decreased concentrating ability or type IV renal tubular acidosis years before there is significant nephron loss and proteinuria from secondary FSGS. Early recognition of these subtle renal abnormalities or development of microalbuminuria in a child with sickle cell disease may warrant consultation with a nephrologist and/or therapy with low-dose ACEIs. Papillary necrosis may result from ischemia due to sickling of red cells in the relatively hypoxemic and hypertonic medullary vasculature and present with gross hematuria and ureteric obstruction by sloughed ischemic papillae (Table 285-3).

Tubulointerstitial Abnormalities Associated with Glomerulonephritis

Primary glomerulopathies are often associated with damage to tubules and interstitium. This may occasionally be due to the same pathologic process affecting the glomerulus and tubulointerstitium, as is the case with immune-complex deposition in lupus nephritis. More often, however, chronic tubulointerstitial changes occur as a secondary consequence of prolonged glomerular dysfunction. Potential mechanisms by which glomerular disease might cause tubulointerstitial injury include proteinuria-mediated damage to the epithelial cells, activation of tubular cells by cytokines and complement, or reduced peritubular blood flow leading to downstream tubulointerstitial ischemia, especially in the case of glomeruli that are globally obsolescent due to severe glomerulonephritis. It is often difficult to discern the initial cause of injury by renal biopsy in a patient who presents with advanced renal disease in this setting.

Analgesic Nephropathy

Analgesic nephropathy results from the long-term use of compound analgesic preparations containing phenacetin (banned in the United States since 1983), aspirin, and caffeine. In its classic form, analgesic nephropathy is characterized by renal insufficiency, papillary necrosis (Table 285-3) attributable to the presumed concentration of the drug to toxic levels in the inner medulla, and a radiographic constellation of small, scarred kidneys with papillary calcifications best appreciated by computed tomography (Fig. 285-5). Patients may also have polyuria due to impaired concentrating ability and non-anion-gap metabolic acidosis from tubular damage. Shedding of a sloughed necrotic papilla can cause gross hematuria and ureteric colic due to ureteral obstruction. Individuals with end-stage kidney disease as a result of analgesic nephropathy are at increased risk of a urothelial malignancy compared to patients with other causes of renal failure. Recent cohort studies in individuals with normal baseline renal function suggest that the moderate chronic use of current analgesic preparations available in the United States, including acetaminophen and NSAIDs, does not seem to cause the constellation of findings known as analgesic nephropathy, although volume-depleted individuals and those with chronic kidney disease are at higher risk of NSAID-related renal toxicity. Nonetheless, it is recommended that heavy users of acetaminophen and NSAIDs be screened for evidence of renal disease.

Chinese Herbal Nephropathy and Balkan Nephropathy

Nontraditional (alternative or herbal) medications can also lead to progressive tubulointerstitial disease. In Chinese herbal nephropathy, first described in young women taking Chinese herbal preparations as part of a weight-loss regimen, one of the offending agents has been identified as aristolochic acid, a botanical product and known rodent carcinogen from the plant Aristolochia. This chemical, after prolonged exposure, produces renal interstitial fibrosis with a relative paucity of cellular infiltrates. The urine sediment is bland, with rare leukocytes and only mild proteinuria. Anemia may be disproportionately severe relative to the level of renal dysfunction. Like analgesic nephropathy, Chinese herbal nephropathy has been associated with a long-term increased risk of bladder and ureteral malignancies. There is recent evidence that Balkan endemic nephropathy, a chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis found primarily in towns along the tributaries of the Danube River, may also be linked to aristolochic acid as a result of contamination of local grain preparations. Although other environmental factors for Balkan endemic nephropathy, such as the mycotoxin ochratoxin A or water-soluble hydrocarbons leached from the coal deposits in the area, have been proposed as causative agents, current evidence appears to be strongest for aristolochic acid. It has been proposed that Chinese herbal nephropathy and Balkan endemic nephropathy be collectively known as aristolochic acid nephropathy.

Lithium-Associated Nephropathy

The use of lithium salts for the treatment of manic-depressive illness may have several renal sequelae, the most common of which is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus manifesting as polyuria and polydipsia. Lithium accumulates in principal cells of the collecting duct by entering through the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), where it inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3 and downregulates vasopressin-regulated aquaporin water channels. Less frequently, chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis develops after prolonged (greater than 10每20 years) lithium use and is most likely to occur in patients that have experienced repeated episodes of toxic lithium levels. Findings on renal biopsy include interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy that are out of proportion to the degree of glomerulosclerosis or vascular disease, a sparse lymphocytic infiltrate, and small cysts or dilation of the distal tubule and collecting duct that are highly characteristic of this disorder. The degree of interstitial fibrosis correlates both with duration and cumulative dose of lithium. Individuals with lithium-associated nephropathy are typically asymptomatic, with minimal proteinuria, few urinary leukocytes, and normal blood pressure. Some patients develop more severe proteinuria due to secondary FSGS, which may contribute to further loss of renal function.

Treatment: Lithium-Associated Nephropathy

Renal function should be followed regularly in patients taking lithium, and caution should be exercised in patients with underlying renal disease. The use of amiloride to inhibit lithium entry via ENaC has been effective to prevent and treat lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, but it is not clear if it will prevent lithium-induced CIN. Once lithium-associated nephropathy is detected, the discontinuation of lithium in attempt to forestall further renal deterioration can be problematic, as lithium is an effective mood stabilizer that is often incompletely substituted by other agents. Furthermore, despite discontinuation of lithium, chronic renal disease in such patients is often irreversible and can slowly progress to end-stage kidney disease. The most prudent approach is to monitor lithium levels frequently and adjust dosing to avoid toxic levels (preferably <1 meq/L). This is especially important as lithium is cleared less effectively as renal function declines. In those cases that develop significant proteinuria, ACEI or ARB treatment should be initiated.

Calciurin-Inhibitor Nephrotoxicity

The calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) immunosuppressive agents cyclosporine and tacrolimus can cause both acute and chronic renal injury. Acute forms can result from vascular causes such as vasoconstriction or the development of thrombotic microangiopathy, or can be due to a toxic tubulopathy. Chronic CNI-induced renal injury is typically seen in solid organ (including heart-lung and liver) transplant recipients and manifests with a slow but irreversible reduction of glomerular filtration rate, with mild proteinuria and arterial hypertension. Hyperkalemia is a relatively common complication and is caused, in part, by tubular resistance to aldosterone. The histologic changes in renal tissue include patchy interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, often in a "striped" pattern. In addition, the intrarenal vasculature often demonstrates hyalinosis, and focal glomerulosclerosis can be present as well. Similar changes may occur in patients receiving CNIs for autoimmune diseases, although the doses are generally lower than those used for organ transplantation. Dose reduction or CNI avoidance appears to mitigate the chronic tubulointerstitial changes, but may increase the risk of rejection and graft loss.

Heavy Metal (Lead) Nephropathy

Heavy metals, such as lead or cadmium, can lead to a chronic tubulointerstitial process after prolonged exposure. The disease entity is no longer commonly diagnosed, because such heavy metal exposure has been greatly reduced due to the known health risks from lead and the consequent removal of lead from most commercial products and fuels. Nonetheless, occupational exposure is possible in workers involved in the manufacture or destruction of batteries, removal of lead paint, or manufacture of alloys and electrical equipment (cadmium) in countries where industrial regulation is less stringent. In addition, ingestion of moonshine whiskey distilled in lead-tainted containers has been one of the more frequent sources of lead exposure.

Early signs of chronic lead intoxication are attributable to proximal tubule dysfunction, particularly hyperuricemia as a result of diminished urate secretion. The triad of "saturnine gout," hypertension, and renal insufficiency should prompt a practitioner to ask specifically about lead exposure. Unfortunately, evaluating lead burden is not as straightforward as ordering a blood test; the preferred methods involve measuring urinary lead after infusion of a chelating agent or by radiographic fluoroscopy of bone. Several recent studies have shown an association between chronic low-level lead exposure and decreased renal function, although either of these two factors may have been the primary event. In those patients who have CIN of unclear origin and an elevated total body lead burden, repeated treatments of lead chelation therapy have been shown to slow the decline in renal function.
 
Metabolic Disorders

Disorders leading to excessively high or low levels of certain electrolytes and products of metabolism can also lead to chronic kidney disease if untreated.

Chronic Uric Acid Nephropathy

The constellation of pathologic findings that represent gouty nephropathy are very uncommon nowadays and are more of historical interest than clinical importance, as gout is typically well managed with allopurinol and other agents. However, there is emerging evidence that hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease, perhaps through endothelial damage. The complex interactions of hyperuricemia, hypertension, and renal failure are still incompletely understood.

Presently, gouty nephropathy is most likely to be encountered in patients with severe tophaceous gout and prolonged hyperuricemia from a hereditary disorder of purine metabolism (Chap. 359). Histologically, the distinctive feature of gouty nephropathy is the presence of crystalline deposits of uric acid and monosodium urate salts in the kidney parenchyma. These deposits not only cause intrarenal obstruction but also incite an inflammatory response, leading to lymphocytic infiltration, foreign-body giant cell reaction, and eventual fibrosis, especially in the medullary and papillary regions of the kidney. Since patients with gout frequently suffer from hypertension and hyperlipidemia, degenerative changes of the renal arterioles may constitute a striking feature of the histologic abnormality, out of proportion to the other morphologic defects. Clinically, gouty nephropathy is an insidious cause of chronic kidney disease. Early in its course, glomerular filtration rate may be near normal, often despite morphologic changes in medullary and cortical interstitium, proteinuria, and diminished urinary concentrating ability. Treatment with allopurinol and urine alkalinization is generally effective in preventing uric acid nephrolithiasis and the consequences of recurrent kidney stones; however, gouty nephropathy may be intractable to such measures. Furthermore, the use of allopurinol in asymptomatic hyperuricemia has not been consistently shown to improve renal function.

Hypercalcemic Nephropathy

(See also Chap. 353) Chronic hypercalcemia, as occurs in primary hyperparathyroidism, sarcoidosis, multiple myeloma, vitamin D intoxication, or metastatic bone disease, can cause tubulointerstitial disease and progressive renal failure. The earliest lesion is a focal degenerative change in renal epithelia, primarily in collecting ducts, distal tubules, and loops of Henle. Tubular cell necrosis leads to nephron obstruction and stasis of intrarenal urine, favoring local precipitation of calcium salts and infection. Dilation and atrophy of tubules eventually occurs, as does interstitial fibrosis, mononuclear leukocyte infiltration, and interstitial calcium deposition (nephrocalcinosis). Calcium deposition may also occur in glomeruli and the walls of renal arterioles.

Clinically, the most striking defect is an inability to maximally concentrate the urine, due to reduced collecting duct responsiveness to AVP and defective transport of sodium and chloride in the loop of Henle. Reductions in both glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow can occur, both in acute and in prolonged hypercalcemia. Eventually, uncontrolled hypercalcemia leads to severe tubulointerstitial damage and overt renal failure. Abdominal x-rays may demonstrate nephrocalcinosis as well as nephrolithiasis, the latter due to the hypercalciuria that often accompanies hypercalcemia.

Treatment consists of reducing the serum calcium concentration toward normal and correcting the primary abnormality of calcium metabolism (Chap. 353). Renal dysfunction of acute hypercalcemia may be completely reversible. Gradual progressive renal insufficiency related to chronic hypercalcemia, however, may not improve even with correction of the calcium disorder.

Hypokalemic Nephropathy

Patients with prolonged and severe hypokalemia from chronic laxative or diuretic abuse, surreptitious vomiting, or primary aldosteronism may develop a reversible tubular lesion characterized by vacuolar degeneration of proximal and distal tubular cells. Eventually, tubular atrophy and cystic dilation accompanied by interstitial fibrosis may ensue, leading to irreversible chronic kidney disease. Timely correction of the hypokalemia will prevent further progression, but persistent hypokalemia can cause ESRD.
 
Global Perspective

The causes of acute and chronic interstitial nephritis vary widely across the globe. Analgesic nephropathy continues to be seen in countries where phenacetin-containing compound analgesic preparations are readily available. Adulterants in unregulated herbal and traditional medicaments pose a threat of toxic interstitial nephritis, as exemplified by aristolochic acid contamination of herbal slimming preparations. Contamination of food sources with toxins, such as the recent outbreak of nephrolithiasis and acute renal failure from melamine contamination of infant milk formula, poses a continuing risk. Likewise, Balkan endemic nephropathy appears likely to be the result of aristolochic acid contamination of grain preparations. While industrial exposure to lead and cadmium has largely disappeared as a cause of chronic interstitial nephritis in developed nations, it remains a risk for nephrotoxicity in countries where such exposure is less well controlled. Conversely, the widespread use of proton pump inhibitors for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Phospho-soda prior to screening colonoscopy has introduced a new spectrum of drug-induced kidney diseases to wealthier nations.

Vascular Injury to the Kidney: Introduction

The renal vasculature is unusually complex with rich arteriolar flow to the cortex in excess of metabolic requirements, consistent with its primary function as a filtering organ. After delivering blood to cortical glomeruli, the postglomerular circulation supplies deeper medullary segments that support energy-dependent solute transport at multiple levels of the renal tubule. These postglomerular vessels carry less blood, and high oxygen consumption leaves the deeper medullary regions at the margin of hypoxemia. Vascular disorders that commonly threaten the blood supply of the kidney include large vessel atherosclerosis, fibromuscular diseases, and embolic, inflammatory, and primary hematologic disorders that produce microvascular injury.
 
Atherosclerosis and Kidney Circulation

Microvascular Disease

The glomerular capillary endothelium shares susceptibility to oxidative stress, pressure injury, and inflammation with other vascular territories. Rates of urinary albumin excretion (UAE) are predictive of systemic atherosclerotic disease events. Increased UAE may develop years before cardiovascular events. UAE and the risk of cardiovascular events are both reduced with pharmacologic therapy such as statins. Experimental studies demonstrate functional changes and rarefaction of renal microvessels under conditions of accelerated atherosclerosis and/or compromise of proximal perfusion pressures with large vessel disease (Fig. 286-1).

Figure 286-1

 
 
 
Examples of micro-CT images from vessels defined by radiopaque casts injected into the renal vasculature. These illustrate the complex, dense cortical capillary network supplying the kidney cortex that can either proliferate or succumb to rarefaction under the influence of atherosclerosis and/or occlusive disease. Changes in blood supply are followed by tubulointerstitial fibrosis and loss of kidney function.

Macrovascular Disease

Large-vessel renal artery occlusive disease can result from extrinsic compression of the vessel, fibromuscular dysplasias, or most commonly, from atherosclerotic disease. Any disorder that reduces perfusion pressure to the kidney can activate mechanisms that tend to restore renal pressures at the expense of developing systemic hypertension. Because restoration of perfusion pressures can reverse these pathways, renal artery stenosis is considered a specifically treatable "secondary" cause of hypertension.

Renal artery stenosis is common and often has only minor hemodynamic effects. Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is reported in 3每5% of normal subjects presenting as potential kidney donors without hypertension. It may present clinically with hypertension in younger individuals (between age 15 and 50), most often women. FMD does not often threaten kidney function, but sometimes produces total occlusion and can be associated with renal artery aneurysms. Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is common in the general population (6.8% of a community-based sample above age 65), a prevalence that increases with age and for patients with other vascular conditions such as coronary artery disease (18每23%) and/or peripheral aortic or lower extremity disease (more than 30%). If untreated, ARAS progresses in nearly 50% of cases over a 5-year period, sometimes to total occlusion. Intensive treatment of arterial blood pressure and statin therapy appear to slow these rates and improve clinical outcomes.

Critical levels of stenosis lead to a reduction in perfusion pressure that activates the renin-angiotensin system, reduces sodium excretion, and activates sympathetic adrenergic pathways. These events lead to systemic hypertension characterized by angiotensin dependence in the early stages, widely varying pressures, loss of circadian blood pressure (BP) rhythms, and accelerated target organ injury, including left ventricular hypertrophy and renal fibrosis. Renovascular hypertension can be treated with agents that block the renin-angiotensin system and other drugs that modify these pressor pathways. It can also be treated with restoration of renal blood flow by either endovascular or surgical revascularization. In most cases, patients require continued antihypertensive drug therapy because revascularization alone rarely lowers BP to normal.

ARAS and systemic hypertension tend to affect both the poststenotic and contralateral kidneys, reducing overall glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in ARAS. When kidney function is threatened by large vessel disease primarily, it has been labeled ischemic nephropathy. Unlike FMD, ARAS develops in patients with other risk factors for atherosclerosis and is commonly superimposed upon preexisting small vessel disease in the kidney resulting from hypertension, aging, and diabetes. Nearly 85% of patients considered for renal revascularization have stage 3每5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) with GFR below 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2. The presence of ARAS is a strong predictor of morbidity- and mortality-related cardiovascular events, independent of whether renal revascularization is undertaken.

Diagnostic approaches to renal artery stenosis depend partly on the specific issues to be addressed. Noninvasive characterization of the renal vasculature may be achieved by several techniques summarized in (Table 286-1). Although activation of the renin-angiotensin system is a key step in developing renovascularhypertension, it is transient. Levels of renin activity are therefore subject to timing, the effects of drugs and sodium intake, and do not reliably predict the response to vascular therapy. Renal artery velocities by Doppler ultrasound above 200 cm/s generally predict hemodynamically important lesions (above 60% vessel lumen occlusion), although treatment trials require velocity above 300 cm/s to avoid false positives. The renal resistive index has predictive value regarding the viability of the kidney. It remains operator- and institution- dependent, however. Captopril-enhanced renography has a strong negative predictive value when entirely normal. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is now less often used, as gadolinium contrast has been associated with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Contrast-enhanced CT with vascular reconstruction provides excellent vascular images and functional assessment, but carries a small risk of contrast toxicity.

Treatment: Renal Artery Stenosis

While restoring renal blood flow and perfusion seems intuitively beneficial for high-grade occlusive lesions, revascularization procedures also pose hazards and expense. Patients with FMD are commonly younger females with otherwise normal vessels and a long life expectancy. These patients often respond well to percutaneous renal artery angioplasty. If blood pressure can be controlled to goal levels and kidney function remains stable in patients with ARAS, it may be argued that medical therapy with follow-up for disease progression is equally effective. Prospective trials up to now fail to identify compelling benefits for interventional procedures regarding short-term results of blood pressure and renal function, although long-term studies regarding cardiovascular outcomes such as stroke, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and end-stage renal failure are not yet complete. Medical therapy should include blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, attainment of goal blood pressures, cessation of tobacco, statins, and aspirin.

Techniques of renal revascularization are improving. With experienced operators, major complications develop in about 9% of cases, including renal artery dissection, capsular perforation, hemorrhage, and occasional atheroembolic disease. Although not common, atheroembolic disease can be catastrophic and accelerate both hypertension and kidney failure, exactly the events that revascularization is intended to prevent. Although renal blood flow usually can be restored by endovascular stenting, recovery of renal function is limited to about 25% of cases, with no change in 50%, and some deterioration evident in others. When hypertension is refractory to effective therapy, revascularization offers real benefits. Table 286-2 summarizes currently accepted guidelines for considering renal revascularization.

Atheroembolic Renal Disease

Emboli to the kidneys arise most frequently as a result of cholesterol crystals breaking free of atherosclerotic vascular plaque and lodging in downstream microvessels. Most clinical atheroembolic events follow angiographic procedures, often of the coronary vessels. It has been argued that nearly all vascular interventional procedures lead to plaque fracture and release of microemboli, but clinical manifestations develop only in a fraction of these. The incidence of clinical atheroemboli has been increasing with more vascular procedures and longer life spans. Atheroembolic renal disease is suspected in more than 3% of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in elderly subjects and is likely underdiagnosed. It is more frequent in males with history of diabetes, hypertension, and ischemic cardiac disease. Atheroemboli in the kidney are strongly associated with aortic aneurysmal disease and renal artery stenosis. Most clinical cases can be associated with precipitating events, such as angiography, vascular surgery, anticoagulation with heparin, thrombolytic therapy, or trauma. Clinical manifestations of this syndrome commonly develop between 1 and 14 days after an inciting event and may continue to develop for weeks thereafter. Systemic embolic disease manifestations, such as fever, abdominal pain, and weight loss are present in less than half of patients, although cutaneous manifestations including livedo reticularis and localized toe gangrene may be more common. Worsening hypertension and deteriorating kidney function are common, sometimes reaching a malignant phase. Progressive renal failure can occur and require dialytic support. These cases often develop after a stuttering onset over many weeks and have an ominous prognosis. Mortality rate after 1 year reaches 38%, and although some may eventually recover sufficiently to no longer require dialysis, many do not.

Beyond the clinical manifestations above, laboratory findings include rising creatinine, eosinophilia (60每80%), elevated sedimentation rate, and hypocomplementemia (15%). Establishing this diagnosis can be difficult and is often by exclusion. Definitive diagnosis depends upon kidney biopsy demonstrating microvessel occlusion with cholesterol crystals that leave a "cleft" in the vessel. Biopsies obtained from patients undergoing surgical revascularization of the kidney indicate that silent cholesterol emboli are frequently present before any further manipulation is performed.

No effective therapy is available for atheroembolic disease once it has developed. Withdrawal of anticoagulation is recommended. Late recovery of kidney function after supportive measures sometimes occurs, and statin therapy may improve outcome. The role of embolic protection devices in the renal circulation is unclear, but a few prospective trials have failed to demonstrate major benefits. These devices are limited to distal protection during the endovascular procedure and offer no protection from embolic debris after removal.
 
Thromboembolic Renal Disease

Thrombotic occlusion of renal vessels or branch arteries can lead to declining renal function and hypertension. It is difficult to diagnose and is often overlooked, especially in elderly patients. Thrombosis can develop as a result of local vessel abnormalities, such as local dissection, trauma, or inflammatory vasculitis. While hypercoagulability conditions sometimes present as renal artery thrombosis, this is rare. It can also derive from distant embolic events, e.g., the left atrium in patients with atrial fibrillation or from fat emboli originating from traumatized tissue, most commonly large bone fractures. Cardiac sources include vegetations from subacute bacterial endocarditis. Systemic emboli to the kidneys may also arise from the venous circulation if right-to-left shunting occurs, e.g., through a patent foramen ovale.

Clinical manifestations vary depending upon the rapidity of onset and extent of occlusion. Acute arterial thrombosis may produce flank pain, fever, leukocytosis, nausea, and vomiting. If kidney infarction results, enzymes such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) rise to extreme levels. If both kidneys are affected, renal function will decline precipitously with a drop in urine output. If a single kidney is involved, renal functional changes may be minor. Hypertension related to sudden release of renin from ischemic tissue can develop rapidly, so long as some viable tissue in the "peri-infarct" border zone remains. If the infarct zone demarcates precisely, the rise in blood pressure and renin activity may resolve. Diagnosis of renal infarction may be established by vascular imaging with MR, CT angiography, or arteriography (Figs. 286-2A and B).

Management of Arterial Thrombosis of the Kidney

Options for interventions of newly detected arterial occlusion include surgical reconstruction, anticoagulation, thrombolytic therapy, endovascular procedures, and supportive care, particularly antihypertensive drug therapy. Application of these methods depends upon the patient's overall condition, the precipitating factors (e.g., local trauma or systemic illness), the magnitude of renal tissue and function at risk, and the likelihood of recurrent events in the future. For unilateral disease, e.g., arterial dissection with thrombosis, supportive care with anticoagulation may suffice. Acute, bilateral occlusion is potentially catastrophic, producing anuric renal failure. Depending upon the precipitating event, surgical or thrombolytic therapies can sometimes restore kidney viability.
 
Microvascular Injury and Hypertension

Arteriolonephrosclerosis

"Malignant" Hypertension

Although BP rises with age, it has long been recognized that some individuals develop rapidly progressive BP elevations with target organ injury including retinal hemorrhages, encephalopathy, and declining kidney function. Placebo arms during the controlled trials of hypertension therapy identified progression to severe levels in 20% of subjects over 5 years. If untreated, patients with target organ injury including papilledema and declining kidney function suffered mortality rates in excess of 50% over 6每12 months, hence the designation "malignant." Postmortem studies of such patients identified vascular lesions, designated "fibrinoid necrosis," with breakdown of the vessel wall, deposition of eosinophilic material including fibrin, and a perivascular cellular infiltrate. A separate lesion was identified in the larger interlobular arteries in many patients with hyperplastic proliferation of the vascular wall cellular elements, deposition of collagen, and separation of layers, designated the "onionskin" lesion. For many of these patients, fibrinoid necrosis led to obliteration of glomeruli and loss of tubular structures. Progressive kidney failure ensued and without dialysis support led to early mortality in untreated malignant-phase hypertension. These vascular changes could develop with pressure-related injury from a variety of hypertensive pathways, including but not limited to activation of the renin-angiotensin system, and severe vasospasm associated with catecholamine release. Occasionally endothelial injury is sufficient to induce microangiopathic hemolysis as discussed below.

Antihypertensive therapy is the mainstay of therapy for malignanthypertension. With effective BP reduction, manifestations of vascular injury including microangiopathic hemolysis and renal dysfunction can improve over time. Whereas mortality in series reported before the era of drug therapy suggested that 1-year mortality rates exceeded 90%, current survival over 5 years exceeds 50%.

Malignanthypertension is less common in Western countries, although it persists in parts of the world where medical care and antihypertensive drug therapy are less available. It most commonly develops in patients with treated hypertension that neglect to take medications, or who may use vasospastic drugs, such as cocaine. Renal abnormalities typically include rising serum creatinine, occasionally hematuria and proteinuria. Biochemical findings may include evidence of hemolysis (anemia, schistocytes, and reticulocytosis) and changes associated with kidney failure. African-American males are more likely to develop rapidly progressive hypertension and kidney failure than are whites in the United States. Genetic polymorphisms (MYH9) that are common in the African-American population and predispose to subtle focal sclerosing glomerular disease may be responsible, with hypertension developing secondary to renal disease in this instance.

"Hypertensive Nephrosclerosis"

Based on experience with malignanthypertension and epidemiologic evidence linking BP with long-term risks of kidney failure, it has long been assumed that lesser degrees of hypertension induce less severe, but prevalent changes in kidney vessels and loss of kidney function. As a result, a large portion of patients reaching ESRD without a specific etiologic diagnosis are assigned the designation "hypertensive nephrosclerosis." Pathologic examination commonly identifies afferent arteriolar thickening with deposition of homogeneous eosinophilic material (hyaline arteriolosclerosis) associated with narrowing of vascular lumina. Clinical manifestations include retinal vessel changes associated with hypertension (arteriolar narrowing, crossing changes), left ventricular hypertrophy, and elevated blood pressure. The role of these vascular changes in kidney function is unclear. Postmortem and biopsy samples from normotensive kidney donors demonstrate similar vessel changes associated with aging, dyslipidemia, and glucose intolerance. While BP reduction does slow progression of proteinuric kidney diseases and is warranted to reduce the excessive cardiovascular risks associated with CKD, antihypertensive therapy does not alter the course of kidney dysfunction identified specifically as hypertensive nephrosclerosis.
 
Thrombotic Microangiopathy

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) refers to injured endothelial cells that are thickened, swollen, or detached mainly from arterioles and capillaries. Platelet and hyaline thrombi causing partial or complete occlusion are integral to the histopathology. TMA is the histologic result of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), which consumes platelets and erythrocytes and is characterized by thrombocytopenia and schistocytes. In the kidney, TMA is characterized by swelling of the endocapillary cells (endotheliosis), fibrin thrombi, platelet plugs, arterial intimal fibrosis, and membranoproliferative changes. In severe cases, the fibrin thrombi may extend into the arteriolar vascular pole producing glomerular collapse and sometimes cortical necrosis. Secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis may be seen in individuals who recover from acute TMA. Diseases that present with this lesion include thrombotic thrombocytopenia (TTP), hemolytic-uremia syndrome (HUS), malignanthypertension, scleroderma renal crisis, antiphospholipid syndrome, preeclampsia/HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count) syndrome, HIV infection, and radiation nephropathy.

Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS)/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)

HUS and TTP are the prototypes of MAHA. Whether they represent a spectrum of the same disease or two distinct entities continues to be debated. Histologically, the diseases are inseparable, but they differ regarding epidemiology and pathophysiology. Typical HUS usually affects children (most under the age of 5) and is preceded by hemorrhagic diarrhea. Typical TTP affects individuals in their thirties and forties. Neurologic symptoms are more common in TTP and have significant morbidity and mortality rates if not treated with plasma exchange, while plasma exchange is ineffective in most HUS. The argument is strengthened with the discovery of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif member 13 (ADAMTS13), a von Willebrand factor (vWF) cleaving protease that is either absent or inactive in TTP but not in HUS. However, neurologic symptoms can occur in HUS, and low ADAMTS13 activity has been identified in HUS cases. Furthermore, plasma infusion/exchange is effective in some HUS. As a result, the distinction between the two is blurred, and they are often identified simply as HUS/TTP.

Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome

There are at least four variants of HUS. The most common is D+ HUS referring to its association with bacterial gastroenteritis. This typically affects young children (<5 years), but adults are also susceptible. More than 80% of cases are preceded within a week by diarrhea, often bloody. Gastrointestinal symptoms include abdominal pain, cramping, and vomiting. Fever is typically absent. Neurologic symptoms are common and may include lethargy, encephalopathy, seizures, and even cerebral infarction. The pathogenic agent linked to D+ HUS is the shiga toxin, also referred to as verotoxin. This toxin is produced by certain strains of Escherichia coli and Shigella dysenteriae. In the United States and Europe, the most common shiga-toxigenic E. coli (STEC) strain is the 0157:H7. Other strains such as 0157/H每, 0111:H每, 026:H11/H每, and 0145:H28 can also produce shiga toxin. Once shiga toxin enters the circulation, it binds to neutrophils and preferentially localizes in the kidney, where it causes damage to the endothelial cells. This results in platelet aggregation, which initiates the microangiopathic process. Another bacterium associated with HUS is Streptococcus pneumoniae. This bacterium produces a neuraminidase that cleaves the N-acetyl neuraminic acid moieties that cover the Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen on platelets and endothelial cells. Exposure of this normally cryptic antigen to preformed IgM results in severe MAHA.

Another variant produces atypical HUS (aHUS), caused by congenital complement dysregulation rather than a toxin. These patients have low C3 levels, a characteristic of alternative pathway activation. The most common cause is a deficiency of factor H, which has been linked to families with aHUS. Factor H competes with factor B to prevent the formation of C3b,Bb and acts as a cofactor for factor I, which proteolytically degrades C3b. More than 70 mutations of the factor H gene have been identified. Most are missense mutations that produce normal levels of factor H with abnormalities mainly in the C-terminus region, which affect its binding to C3b. Other mutations result in low or complete absence of the protein. Deficiencies in other complement regulatory proteins such as factor I, factor B, membrane cofactor protein or MCP (CD46), C3, complement factor H每related protein 1 (CFHR1), CFHR3, and CFHR5 have also been described. Finally, an autoimmune variant of HUS has been discovered. Deficient for CHFR protein and factor H autoantibody每positive (DEAP), HUS occurs when an autoantibody is formed against factor H. DEAP-HUS is often associated with a deletion of an 84-kb fragment of the chromosome that encodes for CFHR1 and CFHR3. The autoantibody blocks the binding of factor H to C3b and surface-bound C3 convertase.

Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura

Traditionally TTP is characterized by the pentad (hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neurologic symptoms, fever, and renal failure). Classic TTP is differentiated from HUS by neurologic involvement. However, in practice, differentiation between TTP and HUS is unreliable due to overlap in clinical manifestations. TTP has been linked with the absence or marked decreased activity in the metalloprotease ADAMTS13 specific for vWF, although this is not universally present. Even complete absence of ADAMTS13 alone does not produce TTP. Most often, an additional trigger (such as infection, surgery, pancreatitis, or pregnancy) initiates clinical TTP.

Data from the Oklahoma TTP/HUS Registry reveal an incidence rate of 11.3 per 106 patients. The median age of the patients was 40 years. Higher frequency was noted among blacks, with an incidence more than nine times higher than non-blacks. Women have nearly three times the incidence, similar to the demographics for systemic lupus erythematosus. If untreated, TTP has a mortality rate exceeding 90%. Even with modern therapy, 20% of the patients die within the first month from complications of microvascular thrombosis.

Several subtypes of TTP have been described. The classic form is acquired or idiopathic TTP, which usually follows an infection, malignancy, or an intense inflammatory reaction such as pancreatitis. This variant typically occurs with deficiency of ADAMTS13 or its activity and is the result of an autoantibody. The autoantibody (IgG or IgM) can either increase clearance of ADAMTS13 or inhibit its activity. A hereditary form with congenital deficiency of ADAMTS13 is seen in patients with Upshaw-Schulman characterized by MAHA and thrombocytopenia. TTP in these patients can start within the first weeks of life, but in others, may not start until several years of age. Environmental and genetic factors are thought to influence the development of TTP. Plasma transfusion is effective as a prevention and treatment during the TTP episodes.

Drug-induced TTP/TMA is a recognized complication of chemotherapeutic agents, immunosuppressive agents, antiplatelet agents, and quinine. Two mechanisms are responsible for drug-induced TMA. With chemotherapeutic agents (mitomycin C, gemcitabine, etc.) and immunosuppressive agents (cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and sirolimus), endothelial damage is the main cause of the MAHA. This process is usually dose-dependent. Alternatively, drugs can induce autoantibodies that produce TMA. Suppression of ADAMTS13 activity and formation of an autoantibody has been detected in patients exposed to ticlopidine. Quinine appears to induce autoantibodies against granulocytes, lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and platelet glycoprotein IbB/IX or IIb/IIIa complexes but not to ADAMTS13. Quinine-associated TTP is more common in women. Autoantibody-associated TTP can occur after a single dose in patients who had previous exposure to the drug. Most patients developing TTP from clopidogrel do not have either autoantibodies or decreased ADAMTS13 activity. Drugs that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) sometimes produce TMA. The mechanism is not fully understood.

Treatment of HUS/TTP should be based on the pathophysiologic pathways that are identified. Autoantibody-mediated TTP and DEAP HUS should be treated with plasma exchange or plasmapheresis. In addition to removing the autoantibodies, plasma exchange replaces ADAMTS13. Twice-daily plasma exchanges, vincristine, and rituximab occasionally have been found to be effective in refractory cases. Plasma infusion is usually sufficient for congenital TTP such as Upshaw-Schulman syndrome. Plasma exchange should be considered if larger volumes of plasma are necessary. TTP secondary to drug-induced autoantibodies responds well to plasma exchange, while drugs that cause endothelial damage may not. D+ HUS should be treated with supportive measures. Plasma exchange has not been found to be effective. Antimotility agents and antibiotics increase the incidence of HUS and should be avoided. Conversely, plasma infusion/exchange may be beneficial in aHUS by repleting complement regulatory proteins. Antibiotics and washed red cells should be given in neuraminidase-associated HUS. Plasma and whole blood should be avoided since they contain IgM, which would exacerbate the MAHA. The coexistence of factor H and ADAMTS13 deficiency can exacerbate TTP and make it less responsive to plasma infusion, illustrating the complexity of managing these disorders.

Transplantation-Associated Thrombotic Microangiopathy (Ta-Tma)

TA-TMA can develop after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with an incidence of 8.2%. Etiologic factors include conditioning regimens, immunosuppression, infections, and graft-versus-host disease. Other risk factors include female sex, age, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched donor grafts. TA-TMA usually occurs within the first 100 days after HSCT. Table 286-3 lists definitions of TA-TMA currently used for clinical trials. A firm diagnosis may be difficult because thrombocytopenia, anemia, and renal insufficiency are common in the posttransplant period. TA-TMA carries a high mortality rate (75% within 3 months). Plasma exchange is beneficial in less than 50% of patients, most of whom have more than 5% ADAMTS13 activity. Calciuria inhibitors should be discontinued, and substitution with daclizumab [antibody to the interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor] is recommended. Treatment with rituximab and defibrotide may also be helpful.

HIV-Related Tma

TMA is mainly a complication encountered before widespread use of highly active retroviral therapy for HIV. It is seen in patients with advanced AIDS and low CD4 count, although it occasionally can be the first manifestation of HIV infection. The presence of MAHA thrombocytopenia and renal failure are suggestive, but renal biopsy is required to establish the diagnosis since HIV is associated with several other renal diseases. The median platelet count is 77,000/L with a range of 10,000 to 160,000/L, which may prohibit a renal biopsy in some patients. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) coinfection may also be a risk factor. The mechanism of injury is unclear, but HIV may induce apoptosis in endothelial cells. Plasma exchange is effective and is recommended in conjunction with antiviral therapy.

Radiation Nephropathy

Radiation can produce microangiopathic injury after either local or total body irradiation. The kidney is one of the most radiosensitive organs, and injury can result with as little as 4每5 Gy exposure. It is characterized by renal insufficiency, proteinuria, and hypertension usually presenting 6 months or longer after radiation exposure. Renal biopsy reveals classic TMA in the kidney with damage to glomerular, tubular, and vascular cells. Systemic evidence for MAHA is rare. Because of its high incidence after allogeneic HSCT, it is often referred to as bone marrow transplant (BMT) nephropathy. No specific therapy is available, although some evidence supports treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockade.

Scleroderma (Progressive Systemic Sclerosis)

Scleroderma commonly affects the kidney, with 52% of subjects with widespread scleroderma having renal involvement sometime during the follow-up period. Of these, 19% were due to scleroderma renal crisis (SRC). Other renal manifestations in scleroderma include transient (prerenal) or medication-related forms of acute kidney injury [e.g., d-penicillamine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or cyclosporine]. SRC occurs in patients with diffuse systemic sclerosis (12 vs. 2% in limited systemic sclerosis). SRC is the most severe manifestation, characterized by accelerated hypertension, a rapid decline in renal function, nephrotic proteinuria, and hematuria. Retinopathy and encephalopathy may accompany the hypertension. Salt and water retention with microvascular injury can lead to pulmonary edema. Other manifestations include myocarditis, pericarditis, and arrhythmias, which denote an especially poor prognosis. Although MAHA is present in over half of the patients, coagulopathy is rare.

The renal lesion in SRC is characterized by arcuate artery intimal and medial proliferation with luminal narrowing. This lesion is described as onionskinning and can be accompanied by glomerular collapse due to reduced blood flow. Histologically it is indistinguishable from malignanthypertension. Fibrinoid necrosis and thrombosis are common. Before the availability of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, the mortality rate for SRC at 1 month was greater than 90%. Introduction of renin-angiotensin system blockade has lowered the mortality rate to 30% at 3 years. Nearly two-thirds of patients with SRC require dialysis support. Half of those needing dialysis as a result of SRC will recover renal function (median time = 1 year). Glomerulonephritis and vasculitis associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) and systemic lupus erythematosus have been described in patients with scleroderma. An association has been found with antinuclear antibodies' (ANAs) speckled pattern and anti-RNA polymerase antibodies (I and III). Anti-U3-RNP may identify young patients at risk for SRC. Anticentromere antibody (ACA), however, is a negative predictor of SRC. Because of the overlap between SRC and other autoimmune disorders, a renal biopsy is recommended for patients with atypical renal involvement, especially if hypertension is absent.

Treatment with ACE inhibition is the first-line therapy unless contraindicated. The goal of therapy is to reduce systolic blood pressure by 20 mmHg and diastolic by 10 mmHg every 24 hours until blood pressure is normalized. Additional antihypertensive therapy may be added once the ACE inhibition is maximized. Both ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists are effective, although published data show that treatment is superior with ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibition alone does not prevent SRC, although it reduces the role of hypertension. Intravenous iloprost has been used in Europe for blood pressure management and improvement of renal perfusion. Kidney transplantation is not recommended for 2 years after the start of dialysis, since delayed recovery may occur.

Antiphospholipid Syndrome (Aps)

Antiphospholipid syndrome (Chap. 320) can be either primary or secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus. It is characterized by systemic thrombosis (arterial and venous) and fetal morbidity mediated by antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs). The aPLs are mainly anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies, which can be IgG, IgM, or IgA, lupus anticoagulant (LA), and anti--2 glycoprotein I antibodies (anti2GPI). Patients with both aCL and anti2GPI appear to have the highest risk of thrombosis. The vascular compartment within the kidney is the main site of renal involvement. Arteriosclerosis is commonly present in the arcuate and intralobular arteries. In the intralobular arteries, fibrous intimal hyperplasia characterized by intimal thickening secondary to intense myofibroblastic intimal cellular proliferation with extracellular matrix deposition is frequently seen along with onionskinning. Arterial and arteriolar fibrous and fibrocellular occlusions are present in over two-thirds of the biopsies. Cortical necrosis and focal cortical atrophy may result from vascular occlusion. TMA is commonly present in the renal biopsies, although signs of MAHA and platelet consumption are usually absent. TMA is especially common in the catastrophic variant of APS. In patients with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), other glomerulopathies may be present including membranous nephropathy, minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis.

Large vessels can be involved in APS and may form the proximal nidus near the ostium for thrombosis of the renal artery. Renal vein thrombosis can occur and should be suspected in patients with lupus anticoagulant LA who develop nephrotic range proteinuria. Progression to end-stage renal disease can occur, and thrombosis may form in the vascular access and the renal allografts. Hypertension is common. Treatment entails lifelong anticoagulation. Glucocorticoids may be beneficial in accelerated hypertension. Immunosuppression and plasma exchange may be helpful for catastrophic episodes of APS, but themselves do not reduce recurrent thrombosis.

HELLP Syndrome

HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome is a dangerous complication of pregnancy. Occurring in 0.5每0.9% of all pregnancies and 10每20% of cases with severe preeclampsia, it has a mortality rate that ranges between 7.4 and 34%. Most commonly occurring in the third trimester, 10% of cases occur before week 27 and 30% postpartum. Although most consider HELLP to be a severe form of preeclampsia, nearly 20% are not preceded by preeclampsia. HELLP patients have increased inflammatory markers [C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-1Ra, and IL-6] as compared to preeclampsia alone.

Renal failure occurs in half of patients with HELLP, although the etiology is not well understood. Limited data suggest renal failure is the result of a combination of preeclampsia and acute tubular necrosis from HELLP. Renal histologic findings are those of TMA with endothelial cell swelling and occlusion of the capillary lumens, but luminal thrombi are typically absent. However, thrombi become more common in severe eclampsia and HELLP. Although renal failure is common, the organ that defines this syndrome is the liver. Subcapsular hepatic hematomas sometimes produce spontaneous rupture of the liver and can be a life-threatening complication. Neurologic complications such as strokes, cerebral infarcts, cerebral and brainstem hemorrhage, and cerebral edema are other major potentially life-threatening complications. Nonfatal complications include placental abruption, permanent vision loss due to Purtscher-like (hemorrhagic and vasoocclusive vasculopathy) retinopathy, pulmonary edema, bleeding, and fetal demise.

The HELLP syndrome shares many features with other forms of MAHA. Distinguishing the specific disorders is complicated by the fact that both aHUS and TTP flares can be triggered by pregnancy. Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome have a higher risk of HELLP. A history of episodes of MAHA before pregnancy is helpful. Serum levels of ADAMTS13 activity is reduced (30每60%) in HELLP but not to the levels seen in TTP (<5%). Some authors suggest using LDH to AST ratio for diagnosis. Patients with HELLP and preeclampsia have an LDH to AST ratio of 13 to 1 versus 29 to 1 in patients without preeclampsia. Other markers such as antithrombin III (decreased in HELLP but not in TTP) and d-dimer (elevated in HELLP but not in TTP) may aid in the diagnosis. HELLP syndrome resolves spontaneously in most cases after delivery, although a portion of HELLP occurs postpartum. Glucocorticoids may decrease inflammatory markers, although two randomized, controlled trials failed to confirm beneficial effects. Plasma exchange should be considered if the hemolysis is refractory to glucocorticoids and/or delivery, especially if TTP had not been ruled out.

Sickle Cell Nephropathy

Renal complications in sickle cell disease (SCD) result from occlusion of the vasa recta in the renal medulla. The low partial pressure of oxygen and high osmolarity predispose to hemoglobin S polymerization and erythrocyte sickling. Sequelae include hyposthenuria, hematuria, and papillary necrosis. The kidney responds by increasing blood flow and GFR mediated by prostaglandins. This dependence on prostaglandins may explain why patients with SCD experience greater reduction of GFR by NSAIDs than others. The glomeruli are typically enlarged. Intracapillary fragmentation and phagocytosis of sickled erythrocytes are thought to be responsible for the membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis-like lesion, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is sometimes seen. Proteinuria is present in 20每30% of the patients, and nephrotic range proteinuria is associated with renal failure. ACE inhibitors reduce proteinuria, although data are lacking on prevention of renal failure. Patients with SCD are also more prone to acute renal failure. The cause is thought to reflect microvascular occlusion associated with nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis, high fever, infection, and generalized sickling. Chronic kidney disease is present in 12每20% of patients. Despite the frequency of renal disease, hypertension is uncommon in patients with SCD.
 
Renal Vein Thrombosis

Renal vein thrombosis (RVT) can either present with flank pain, tenderness, hematuria, rapid decline in renal function, and proteinuria or it can be silent. Occasionally, RVT is identified during workup for pulmonary embolism. The left renal vein is more commonly involved and two-thirds of cases are bilateral. Etiologies can be divided into three broad categories: endothelial damage, venous stasis, and hypercoagulable states. Homocystinuria, endovascular intervention, and surgery can produce vascular endothelial damage. Dehydration, which is more common in males, is a common cause of stasis in the pediatric population. Stasis also can result from compression and kinking of the renal veins from retroperitoneal processes such as retroperitoneal fibrosis and abdominal neoplasms. Thrombosis can occur throughout the renal circulation with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. RVT can also be secondary to nephrotic syndrome, particularly membranous nephropathy. Other hypercoagulable states associated with RVT include proteins C and S, antithrombin deficiency, factor V Leiden, disseminated malignancy, and oral contraceptives.

Diagnostic screening can be performed with Doppler ultrasound, which is more sensitive than ultrasound alone. The most sensitive test is CT angiography, which is nearly 100% sensitive. MR angiography is another option but is more expensive and requires sedation in pediatric patients. Treatment for RVT is anticoagulation and therapy for the underlying cause. Endovascular thrombolysis may be considered in severe cases. Occasionally nephrectomy may be undertaken for life-threatening complications. Vena caval filters are often used to prevent migration of the thrombi.

Nephrolithiasis: Introduction

Kidney stones are one of the most common urologic problems. In the United States, ~13% of men and 7% of women will develop a kidney stone during their lifetimes, and the prevalence is increasing throughout the industrialized world.

Types of Stones

Calcium salts, uric acid, cystine, and struvite are the constituents of most kidney stones in the western hemisphere (Chap. e14). Calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stones make up 75每85% of the total (Table 287-1) and those constituents may be admixed in the same stone. Calcium phosphate in stones is usually hydroxyapatite [Ca5(PO4)3OH] or, less commonly, brushite (CaHPO4H2O), although the incidence of brushite stones is increasing.

Hyperthyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, sarcoidosis, malignant tumors, immobilization, vitamin D intoxication, rapidly progressive bone disease, and Paget's disease all cause hypercalciuria and must be excluded in diagnosis of idiopathic hypercalciuria.
 

Calcium stones are more common in men; the average age of onset is the third to fourth decade. Approximately 50% of people who form a single calcium stone form another within the next 10 years, and some form multiple recurrent stones. The average rate of new stone formation in recurrent stone formers is about one stone every 3 years. Uric acid stones account for 5每10% of kidney stones and are also more common in men. Five percent of stones are struvite, whereas cystine stones are uncommon, accounting for ~1% of cases in most series of nephrolithiasis.

Manifestations of Stones

As stones grow on the surfaces of the renal papillae or within the collecting system, they do not necessarily produce symptoms. Asymptomatic stones may be discovered during the course of radiographic studies undertaken for unrelated reasons. Stones are a common cause of isolated hematuria. Stones become symptomatic when they enter the ureter or occlude the ureteropelvic junction, causing pain and obstruction.

Stone Passage

A stone can traverse the ureter without symptoms, but passage usually produces pain and bleeding. The pain begins gradually, usually in the flank, but increases over the next 20每60 min to become so severe that narcotics may be needed for its control. The pain may remain in the flank or spread downward and anteriorly toward the ipsilateral loin, testis, or vulva. A stone in the portion of the ureter within the bladder wall causes frequency, urgency, and dysuria that may be confused with urinary tract infection. The vast majority of ureteral stones <0.5 cm in diameter pass spontaneously.

Helical computed tomography (CT) scanning without radiocontrast enhancement is now the standard radiologic procedure for diagnosis of nephrolithiasis. The advantages of CT include detection of uric acid stones in addition to the traditional radiopaque stones, no exposure to the risk of radiocontrast agents, and possible diagnosis of other causes of abdominal pain in a patient suspected of having renal colic from stones. Ultrasound is not as sensitive as CT in detecting renal or ureteral stones. Standard abdominal x-rays may be used to monitor patients for formation and growth of kidney stones, as they are less expensive and provide less radiation exposure than CT scans. Calcium, cystine, and struvite stones are all radiopaque on standard x-rays, whereas uric acid stones are radiolucent.

Other Syndromes

Staghorn Calculi

Struvite, cystine, and uric acid stones often grow too large to enter the ureter. They gradually fill the renal pelvis and may extend outward through the infundibula to the calyces themselves. Very large staghorn stones can have surprisingly few symptoms and may lead to the eventual loss of kidney function.

Nephrocalcinosis

Calcium stones grow on the papillae. Most break loose and cause colic, but they may remain in place so that multiple papillary calcifications are found by x-ray, a condition termed nephrocalcinosis. Papillary nephrocalcinosis is common in hereditary distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) and in other types of severe hypercalciuria. In medullary sponge kidney disease (Chap. 284), calcification may occur in dilated distal collecting ducts.

Infection

Although urinary tract infection is not a direct consequence of stone disease, it can occur after instrumentation and surgery of the urinary tract, which are used frequently in the treatment of stone disease. Stone disease and urinary tract infection can enhance their respective seriousness and interfere with treatment. Obstruction of an infected kidney by a stone may lead to sepsis and extensive damage of renal tissue, since it converts the urinary tract proximal to the obstruction into a closed space that can become an abscess. Stones may harbor bacteria in the stone matrix, leading to recurrent urinary tract infection, and infection due to bacteria that have the enzyme urease can cause stones composed of struvite.

Activity of Stone Disease

In active disease, new stones are forming or preformed stones are growing. Sequential radiographs are needed to document the growth or appearance of new stones and ensure that passed stones are actually newly formed, not preexistent.

Pathogenesis of Stones

Urinary stones usually arise because of the breakdown of a delicate balance between solubility and precipitation of salts. The kidneys must conserve water, but they must excrete materials that have low solubility. These two opposing requirements must be balanced during adaptation to diet, climate, and activity. The problem is mitigated to some extent by the fact that urine contains substances such as pyrophosphate, citrate, and glycoproteins that inhibit crystallization. These protective mechanisms are less than perfect. When urine becomes supersaturated with insoluble materials, because excretion rates are excessive and/or because water conservation is extreme, crystals form and may grow and aggregate to form a stone.

Supersaturation

A solution in equilibrium with a solid phase is said to be saturated with respect to that substance. If the concentration of a substance in a solution is above the saturation point, the solution is said to be supersaturated and can support the growth of crystals, and if supersaturation is excessive, new crystals can begin to develop spontaneously. Excessive supersaturation is common in stone formation.

Calcium, oxalate, and phosphate form many soluble complexes among themselves and with other substances in urine, such as citrate. As a result, their free ion activities are below their chemical concentrations. Reduction in ligands such as citrate can increase ion activity and therefore supersaturation. Urine supersaturation can be increased by dehydration or by overexcretion of calcium, oxalate, phosphate, cystine, or uric acid. Urine pH is also important; phosphate and uric acid are acids that dissociate readily over the physiologic range of urine pH. Alkaline urine contains more dibasic phosphate, favoring deposits of brushite and apatite. Below a urine pH of 5.5, uric acid crystals predominate, whereas phosphate crystals are rare. The solubility of calcium oxalate is not influenced by changes in urine pH. Measurements of supersaturation in a 24-h urine sample probably underestimate the risk of precipitation. Transient dehydration, variation of urine pH, and postprandial bursts of overexcretion may cause spikes in supersaturation.

Crystallization

When urine supersaturation is excessive, crystals begin to nucleate. Once formed, crystal nuclei will grow in size if urine is supersaturated with respect to that crystal phase. Multiple crystals can then aggregate to form a kidney stone. For a kidney stone to form, crystals must be retained in the renal pelvis long enough to grow and aggregate to a clinically significant size. Recent studies have shown that common calcium oxalate kidney stones form as overgrowths on apatite plaques in the renal papillae. These plaques, called Randall's plaques, provide an excellent surface for heterogeneous nucleation of calcium oxalate salts. The Randall's plaques begin in the deep medulla in the basement membrane of the thin limb of the loop of Henle and then spread through the interstitium to the basement membrane of the papillary urothelium. If the urothelium becomes damaged, the plaque is exposed to the urine, and calcium oxalate crystals form on the plaque, accumulating a clinically significant mass to form a stone. Calcium phosphate stone formers, particularly formers of brushite, do not follow this pattern. Inner medullary collecting ducts are plugged with apatite crystals, and stones form as extension of those plugs. Unlike in calcium oxalate stone formers, renal papillae are often fibrotic and deformed.

Evaluation and Treatment of Patients with Nephrolithiasis

Most patients with nephrolithiasis have remediable metabolic disorders that cause stones and can be detected by chemical analyses of serum and urine. Adults with recurrent kidney stones and children with even a single kidney stone should be evaluated. A practical outpatient evaluation consists of two 24-h urine collections, with a corresponding blood sample; measurements of serum and urine calcium, uric acid, electrolytes, and creatinine, along with urine pH, volume, oxalate, and citrate should be made. Since stone risks vary with diet, activity, and environment, at least one urine collection should be made on a weekend when the patient is at home and another on a workday. When possible, the composition of kidney stones should be determined because treatment depends on stone type (Table 287-1). No matter what disorders are found, every patient should be counseled to avoid dehydration and drink copious amounts of water. The efficacy of high fluid intake was confirmed in a prospective study of first-time stone formers. Increasing urine volume to 2.5 L per day resulted in a 50% reduction of stone recurrence compared with the control group.

Treatment: Nephrolithiasis

The management of stones already present in the kidneys or urinary tract requires a combined medical and surgical approach. The specific treatment depends on the location of the stone, the extent of obstruction, the nature of the stone, the function of the affected and unaffected kidneys, the presence or absence of urinary tract infection, the progress of stone passage, and the risks of operation or anesthesia in light of the clinical state of the patient. Medical therapy can enhance passage of ureteral stones. Oral 1-adrenergic blockers relax ureteral muscle and have been shown to reduce time to stone passage and the need for surgical removal of small stones. Severe obstruction, infection, intractable pain, and serious bleeding are indications for removal of a stone.

Advances in urologic technology have rendered open surgery for stones a rare event. There are now three alternatives for stone removal. Extracorporeal lithotripsy causes the in situ fragmentation of stones in the kidney, renal pelvis, or ureter by exposing them to shock waves. After multiple shock waves, most stones are reduced to powder that moves through the ureter into the bladder. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy requires the passage of a nephroscope into the renal pelvis through a small incision in the flank. Stones are then disrupted by a small ultrasound transducer or holmium laser. The third method is ureteroscopy with stone disruption using a holmium laser. Ureteroscopy generally is used for stones in the ureter, but some surgeons are now using ureteroscopy for stones in the renal pelvis as well.

Calcium Stones

Idiopathic Hypercalciuria

This condition is the most common metabolic abnormality found in patients with nephrolithiasis (Table 287-1). It is familial and is probably a polygenic trait, although there are some rare monogenic causes of hypercalciuria and kidney stones such as Dent's disease, which is an X-linked disorder characterized by hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and progressive kidney failure. Idiopathic hypercalciuria is diagnosed by the presence of hypercalciuria without hypercalcemia and the absence of other systemic disorders known to affect mineral metabolism. Vitamin D overactivity through either high calcitriol levels or excess vitamin D receptor is a likely explanation for the hypercalciuria in many patients. Recent studies have shown that a polymorphism (Arg990Gly) of the calcium-sensing receptor, which leads to activation of the receptor, is more common in hypercalciuric subjects and probably contributes to higher urine calcium excretion. Hypercalciuria contributes to stone formation by raising urine saturation with respect to calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate.

Treatment: Hypercalciuria

For many years the standard therapy for hypercalciuria was dietary calcium restriction. However, studies have shown that low-calcium diets increase the risk of incident stone formation, perhaps by reducing the amount of calcium in the intestine to bind oxalate, thereby increasing urine oxalate levels. A 5-year prospective trial compared the efficacy of a low-calcium diet to a low-protein, low-sodium, normal-calcium diet in preventing stone recurrence in male calcium stone formers. The group on the low-calcium diet had a significantly greater rate of stone relapse. In addition, hypercalciuric stone formers have reduced bone mineral density and an increased risk of fracture compared with the non-stone-forming population. Low calcium intake probably contributes to the low bone mineral density. In sum, low-calcium diets are of unknown efficacy in preventing stone formation and carry a long-term risk of bone disease, making low-sodium and low-protein diets a superior treatment option. If diet therapy is not sufficient to prevent stones, thiazide diuretics may be used. Thiazide diuretics lower urine calcium and are effective in preventing the formation of stones. Three 3-year randomized trials have shown a 50% decrease in stone formation in the thiazide-treated groups compared with the placebo-treated controls. The drug effect requires slight contraction of the extracellular fluid volume, and high dietary NaCl intake reduces its therapeutic effect. Thiazide-induced hypokalemia should be treated aggressively since hypokalemia will reduce urine citrate, an important inhibitor of calcium crystallization.

Hyperuricosuria

About 20% of calcium oxalate stone formers are hyperuricosuric, primarily because of an excessive intake of purine from meat and fish. The mechanism of stone formation probably involves salting out calcium oxalate by urate. A low-purine diet is desirable but difficult for many patients to achieve. The alternative is allopurinol, which has been shown to be effective in a randomized, controlled trial.

Primary Hyperparathyroidism

(See also Chap. 353) The diagnosis of this condition is established by documenting that hypercalcemia that cannot be otherwise explained is accompanied by inappropriately elevated serum concentrations of parathyroid hormone. Hypercalciuria, which usually is present, raises the urine supersaturation of calcium phosphate and/or calcium oxalate (Table 287-1). Calcium oxalate stones form on interstitial apatite plaque, whereas calcium phosphate stones form on apatite crystals, obstructing collecting ducts. In patients who have hyperparathyroidism, the Arg990Gly polymorphism of the calcium-sensing receptor leads to higher urine calcium excretion and an increased risk of nephrolithiasis. Prompt diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism is important because parathyroidectomy should be carried out before recurrent stones or renal damage occurs.

Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis

(See also Chap. 284) The defect in this condition seems to reside in the distal nephron, which cannot establish a normal pH gradient between urine and blood, leading to hyperchloremic acidosis. The diagnosis is suggested by a minimum urine pH >5.5 in the presence of systemic acidosis. Hypercalciuria, an alkaline urine, and a low urine citrate level increase urine saturation with respect to calcium phosphate. Calcium phosphate stones form, nephrocalcinosis is common, and osteomalacia or rickets may occur. Apatite deposits form in inner medullary collecting ducts and cause extensive medullary tubular interstitial nephropathy, which can lead to reduced kidney function. Renal tubular acidosis may be genetic, secondary to a systemic disease, or caused by a medication. Topiramate, a drug commonly used for seizures and migraines, inhibits the enzyme carbonic anhydrase and may cause calcium nephrolithiasis.

Treatment with supplemental alkali reduces hypercalciuria and limits the production of new stones. The preferred form of alkali is potassium citrate, which is given at a dose of 0.5每2.0 meq/kg body weight in two to three divided doses per day. In incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis, systemic acidosis is absent, but urine pH cannot be lowered below 5.5 after an exogenous acid load. Incomplete RTA may develop in some patients who form calcium oxalate stones because of idiopathic hypercalciuria; the importance of RTA in producing stones in this situation is uncertain, and thiazide treatment is a reasonable alternative. Alkali also can be used in incomplete RTA. In treating patients with alkali, it is prudent to monitor changes in urine citrate and pH. If urine pH increases without an increase in citrate, calcium phosphate supersaturation will increase and stone disease may worsen.

Hyperoxaluria

Oxalate is a metabolic end product in humans. Urine oxalate comes from diet and endogenous metabolic production, with ~40每50% originating from dietary sources. The upper limit of normal for oxalate excretion is generally considered to be 40每50 mg per day. Mild hyperoxaluria (50每80 mg/d) usually is caused by excessive intake of high-oxalate foods such as spinach, nuts, and chocolate. In addition, low-calcium diets may promote hyperoxaluria as there is less calcium available to bind oxalate in the intestine. Enteric hyperoxaluria is a consequence of small-bowel disease, resulting in fat malabsorption. Oxalate excretion is often >100 mg per day. Enteric hyperoxaluria may be caused by jejunoileal bypass for obesity, pancreatic insufficiency, or extensive small-intestine involvement from Crohn's disease. With fat malabsorption, calcium in the bowel lumen is bound by fatty acids instead of oxalate, which is left free for absorption in the colon. Delivery of unabsorbed fatty acids and bile salts to the colon injures the colonic mucosa and enhances oxalate absorption. Recent studies have shown that modern bariatric surgery for obesity that involves bypassing intestinal segments, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and biliopancreatic diversions, may lead to hyperoxaluria that can cause kidney failure as well as kidney stones. The mechanism of hyperoxaluria has not been well studied.

Primary hyperoxaluria is a rare autosomal recessive disease that causes severe hyperoxaluria. Patients usually present with recurrent calcium oxalate stones during childhood. Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 is due to a deficiency in the peroxisomal enzyme alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase. Type 2 is due to a deficiency of D-glyceric dehydrogenase. Severe hyperoxaluria from any cause can lead to stone formation and produce tubulointerstitial nephropathy (Chap. 285).

Treatment: Hyperoxaluria

Patients with mild to moderate hyperoxaluria should be treated with a diet low in oxalate and with a normal intake of calcium and magnesium to reduce oxalate absorption. Enteric hyperoxaluria can be treated with a low-fat, low-oxalate diet and calcium supplements, given with meals, to bind oxalate in the gut lumen. The oxalate-binding resin cholestyramine provides an additional form of therapy. Treatment for primary hyperoxaluria includes a high fluid intake, neutral phosphate, potassium citrate, and pyridoxine (25每200 mg/d). Even with aggressive therapy, irreversible renal failure may occur. Liver transplantation to correct the enzyme defect, combined with kidney transplantation, has been successfully utilized in patients with primary hyperoxaluria.

Hypocitraturia

Urine citrate prevents calcium stone formation by creating a soluble complex with calcium, effectively reducing free urine calcium. Hypocitraturia is found in 20每40% of stone formers either as a single disorder or in combination with other metabolic abnormalities. It can be secondary to systemic disorders such as RTA, chronic diarrheal illness, and hypokalemia, or it may be a primary disorder, in which case it is called idiopathic hypocitraturia.

Treatment: Hypocitraturia

Treatment is with alkali, which increases urine citrate excretion; generally, bicarbonate or citrate salts are used. Potassium salts are preferred as sodium loading increases urinary excretion of calcium, reducing the effectiveness of treatment. Two randomized, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of citrate supplements in calcium oxalate stone formers. Lemonade and other citrate-rich beverages have been used to treat hypocitraturia, although the increase in urine citrate is not as great as is seen with pharmacologic dosing of citrate salts.

Idiopathic Calcium Lithiasis

Some patients have no metabolic cause for stones despite a thorough metabolic evaluation (Table 287-1). The best treatment appears to be high fluid intake so that the urine specific gravity remains at 1.005 throughout the day and night. Thiazide diuretics and citrate therapy may help reduce crystallization of calcium salts, but there have been no prospective trials in this patient population. Oral phosphate at a dose of 2 g phosphorus daily may lower urine calcium and increase urine pyrophosphate, thereby reducing the rate of recurrence. Orthophosphate causes mild nausea and diarrhea, but tolerance may improve with continued intake.

Uric Acid Stones

Persistently acidic urine is the major risk factor for uric acid stone formation. When urine pH is low, the protonated form of uric acid predominates and is soluble in urine at concentrations of 100 mg/L. Concentrations above this level represent supersaturation that causes crystals and stones to form. Common causes of acidic urine and uric acid stones include metabolic syndrome, chronic diarrheal states, gout, and idiopathic uric acid lithiasis. As the prevalence of obesity increases, metabolic syndrome is becoming an increasingly important cause of uric acid stone formation, as insulin resistance leads to a decrease in ammoniagenesis, requiring that the metabolic acid load be excreted as titratable acid. Hyperuricosuria, when present, increases supersaturation, but urine of low pH can be supersaturated with uric acid even though the daily excretion rate is normal. Myeloproliferative syndromes, chemotherapy for malignant tumors, and Lesch-Nyhan syndrome cause such massive production of uric acid and consequent hyperuricosuria that stones and uric acid sludge form even at a normal urine pH. Obstruction of the renal tubules by uric acid crystals can cause acute renal failure.

Treatment: Uric Acid Lithiasis

The two goals of treatment are to raise urine pH and lower excessive urine uric acid excretion to <1 g/d. Supplemental alkali, 1每3 meq/kg of body weight per day, should be given in three or four divided doses, one of which should be given at bedtime. The goal of treatment should be a urine pH between 6 and 6.5 in a 24-h urine collection. Increasing urine pH above 6.5 will not provide additional benefit in preventing uric acid crystallization but increases the risk of calcium phosphate stone formation. The form of the alkali may be important. Potassium citrate may reduce the risk of calcium salts crystallizing when urine pH is increased, whereas sodium alkali salts may increase the risk. A low-purine diet should be instituted in uric acid stone formers with hyperuricosuria. Patients who continue to form uric acid stones despite treatment with fluids, alkali, and a low-purine diet should have allopurinol added to their regimen.

Cystinuria and Cystine Stones

(See also Chap. 364) In this inherited disorder, proximal tubular and jejunal transport of the dibasic amino acids cystine, lysine, arginine, and ornithine is defective, and excessive amounts are lost in the urine. Clinical disease is due solely to the insolubility of cystine. Cystine crystals plug terminal collecting ducts, and stones may grow as an extension of those plugs. Damage to the papillae and medulla from crystal obstruction is the probable reason why kidney function is reduced in cystinuria compared with routine stone disease.

Pathogenesis

Cystinuria occurs because of defective transport of dibasic amino acids by the brush borders of renal tubule and intestinal epithelial cells. Disease-causing mutations have been identified in both the heavy and light chains of a heteromeric amino acid transporter found in the proximal tubule of the kidney. Cystinuria is classified into two main types, based on the urinary excretion of cystine in obligate heterozygotes. In type I cystinuria, heterozygotes have normal urine cystine excretion; thus, type I has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. A gene on chromosome 2 that has been designated SLC3A1 encodes the heavy chain of the transporter and has been found to be abnormal in type I. In non-type I cystinuria, heterozygotes have moderately elevated urine cystine excretion, with homozygotes having a much higher urine cystine excretion. Non-type I is inherited as a dominant trait with incomplete penetrance. Non-type I is due to mutations in the SLC7A9 gene on chromosome 19, which encodes the light chain of the heteromeric transporter. In rare cases, mutations of the SLC7A9 gene can lead to a type I phenotype.

Diagnosis

Cystine stones are formed only by patients with cystinuria, but 10% of stones in cystinuric patients do not contain cystine; therefore, every stone former should be screened for the disease. The sediment from a first morning urine specimen in many patients with homozygous cystinuria reveals typical hexagonal, platelike cystine crystals. Cystinuria can also be detected by using the urine sodium nitroprusside test. Because the test is sensitive, it is positive for cystinuria in many asymptomatic heterozygotes. A positive nitroprusside test or the finding of cystine crystals in the urine sediment should be evaluated by measurement of daily cystine excretion. Cystine stones seldom form in adults unless urine excretion is at least 300 mg/d.

Treatment: Cystinuria and Cystine Stones

High fluid intake, even at night, is the cornerstone of therapy. Daily urine volume should exceed 3 L. Raising urine pH with alkali is helpful provided that the urine pH exceeds 7.5. A low-salt diet (100 mmol/d) can reduce cystine excretion up to 40%. Because side effects are common, drugs such as penicillamine and tiopronin, which form mixed soluble disulfide cysteine-drug complexes, should be used only when fluid loading, salt reduction, and alkali therapy are ineffective. Low-methionine diets have not proved to be practical for clinical use, but patients should avoid protein gluttony.

Struvite Stones

These stones are a result of urinary infection with bacteria, usually Proteus species, which possess urease, an enzyme that degrades urea to NH3 and CO2. The NH3 hydrolyzes to NH4+ and raises urine pH to 8 or 9. The NH4+ precipitates PO43每 and Mg2+ to form MgNH4PO4 (struvite). Struvite does not form in urine in the absence of infection, because NH4+ concentration is low in urine that is alkaline in response to physiologic stimuli. Chronic Proteus infection can occur because of impaired urinary drainage, urologic instrumentation or surgery, and especially with chronic antibiotic treatment, which can favor the dominance of Proteus in the urinary tract. The presence of struvite crystals in urine, rectangular prisms that resemble coffin lids, indicates infection with urease-producing organisms.

Treatment: Struvite Stones

Complete removal of the stone with subsequent sterilization of the urinary tract is the treatment of choice for patients who can tolerate the procedures. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is the preferred surgical approach for most patients. At times, extracorporeal lithotripsy may be used in combination with a percutaneous approach. Open surgery is rarely required. Irrigation of the renal pelvis and calyces with hemiacidrin, a solution that dissolves struvite, can reduce recurrence after surgery. Stone-free rates of 50每90% have been reported after surgical intervention. Antimicrobial treatment is best reserved for dealing with acute infection and for maintenance of a sterile urine after surgery. Urine cultures and culture of stone fragments removed at surgery should guide the choice of antibiotic. For patients who are not candidates for surgical removal of a stone, acetohydroxamic acid, an inhibitor of urease, can be used. Unfortunately, acetohydroxamic acid has many side effects, such as headache, tremor, and thrombophlebitis, that limit its use.

Urinary Tract Infections, Pyelonephritis, and Prostatitis: Introduction

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common and painful human illness that, fortunately, is rapidly responsive to modern antibiotic therapy. In the preantibiotic era, UTI caused significant morbidity. Hippocrates, writing about a disease that appears to have been acute cystitis, said that the illness could last for a year before either resolving or worsening to involve the kidneys. When chemotherapeutic agents used to treat UTI were introduced in the early twentieth century, they were relatively ineffective, and persistence of infection after 3 weeks of therapy was common. Nitrofurantoin, which became available in the 1950s, was the first tolerable and effective agent for the treatment of UTI.

Since the most common manifestation of UTI is acute cystitis and since acute cystitis is far more prevalent among women than among men, most clinical research on UTI has involved women. Many studies have enrolled women from college campuses or large health maintenance organizations in the United States. Therefore, when reviewing the literature and recommendations concerning UTI, clinicians must consider whether the findings are applicable to their patient populations.

Definitions

UTI may be asymptomatic (subclinical infection) or symptomatic (disease). Thus, the term UTI encompasses a variety of clinical entities, including asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU), cystitis, prostatitis, and pyelonephritis. The distinction between symptomatic UTI and ABU has major clinical implications. Both UTI and ABU connote the presence of bacteria in the urinary tract, usually accompanied by white blood cells and inflammatory cytokines in the urine. However, ABU occurs in the absence of symptoms attributable to the bacteria in the urinary tract and does not usually require treatment, while UTI has more typically been assumed to imply symptomatic disease that warrants antimicrobial therapy. Much of the literature concerning UTI, particularly catheter-associated infection, does not differentiate between UTI and ABU. In this chapter, the term UTI denotes symptomatic disease; cystitis, symptomatic infection of the bladder; and pyelonephritis, symptomatic infection of the kidneys. Uncomplicated UTI refers to acute cystitis or pyelonephritis in nonpregnant outpatient women without anatomic abnormalities or instrumentation of the urinary tract; complicated UTI is a catch-all term that encompasses all other types of UTI. Recurrent UTI is not necessarily complicated; individual episodes can be uncomplicated and treated as such. Catheter-associated bacteriuria can be either symptomatic (CAUTI) or asymptomatic.

Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Except among infants and the elderly, UTI occurs far more commonly in females than in males. During the neonatal period, the incidence of UTI is slightly higher among males than among females because male infants more commonly have congenital urinary tract anomalies. After 50 years of age, obstruction from prostatic hypertrophy becomes common in men, and the incidence of UTI is almost as high among men as among women. Between 1 year and ~50 years of age, UTI and recurrent UTI are predominantly diseases of females. The prevalence of ABU is ~5% among women between ages 20 and 40 and may be as high as 40每50% among elderly women and men.

As many as 50每80% of women in the general population acquire at least one UTI during their lifetime〞uncomplicated cystitis in most cases. Recent use of a diaphragm with spermicide, frequent sexual intercourse, and a history of UTI are independent risk factors for acute cystitis. Cystitis is temporally related to recent sexual intercourse, with a sixtyfold increase in the relative odds of acute cystitis in the 48 h after intercourse. In healthy postmenopausal women, sexual activity, diabetes mellitus, and incontinence are risk factors for UTI.

Many factors predisposing women to cystitis also increase the risk of pyelonephritis. Factors independently associated with pyelonephritis in young healthy women include frequent sexual intercourse, a new sexual partner, a UTI in the previous 12 months, a maternal history of UTI, diabetes, and incontinence. The common risk factors for cystitis and pyelonephritis are not surprising given that pyelonephritis typically arises through the ascent of bacteria from the bladder to the upper urinary tract. However, pyelonephritis can occur without clear antecedent cystitis.

About 20每30% of women who have had one episode of UTI will have recurrent episodes. Early recurrence (within 2 weeks) is usually regarded as relapse rather than reinfection and may indicate the need to evaluate the patient for a sequestered focus. Intracellular pods of infecting organisms within the bladder epithelium have been demonstrated in animal models of UTI, but the importance of this phenomenon in humans is not yet clear. The rate of recurrence ranges from 0.3 to 7.6 infections per patient per year, with an average of 2.6 infections per year. It is not uncommon for multiple recurrences to follow an initial infection, resulting in clustering of episodes. Clustering may be related temporally to the presence of a new risk factor or to the sloughing of the protective outer bladder epithelial layer in response to bacterial attachment during acute cystitis. The likelihood of a recurrence decreases with increasing time since the last infection. A case-control study of predominantly white premenopausal women with recurrent UTI identified frequent sexual intercourse, use of spermicide, a new sexual partner, a first UTI before 15 years of age, and a maternal history of UTI as independent risk factors for recurrent UTI.

The only consistently documented behavioral risk factors for recurrent UTI include frequent sexual intercourse and spermicide use. In postmenopausal women, anatomic factors affecting bladder emptying, such as cystoceles, urinary incontinence, and residual urine, are most strongly associated with recurrent UTI.

In pregnant women, ABU has clinical consequences, and both screening for and treatment of this condition are indicated. Specifically, ABU during pregnancy is associated with preterm birth and perinatal mortality for the fetus and with pyelonephritis for the mother. A Cochrane meta-analysis found that treatment of ABU in pregnant women decreased the risk of pyelonephritis by 75%.

The majority of men with UTI have a functional or anatomic abnormality of the urinary tract, most commonly urinary obstruction secondary to prostatic hypertrophy. That said, not all men with UTI have detectable urinary abnormalities; this point is particularly relevant for men 45 years of age. Lack of circumcision is also associated with an increased risk of UTI, because Escherichia coli is more likely to colonize the glans and prepuce and subsequently migrate into the urinary tract.

Women〞but not men〞with diabetes have a two- to threefold higher rate of ABU and UTI than women without diabetes. Increased duration of diabetes and the use of insulin rather than oral medication are also associated with a higher risk of UTI among women with diabetes. Poor bladder function, obstruction in urinary flow, and incomplete voiding are additional factors commonly found in patients with diabetes that increase the risk of UTI. Impaired cytokine secretion may contribute to ABU in diabetic women.

Etiology

The uropathogens causing UTI vary by clinical syndrome but are usually enteric gram-negative rods that have migrated to the urinary tract. The susceptibility patterns of these organisms vary by clinical syndrome and by geography. In acute uncomplicated cystitis in the United States, the etiologic agents are highly predictable: E. coli accounts for 75每90% of isolates; Staphylococcus saprophyticus for 5每15% (with particularly frequent isolation from younger women); and Klebsiella species, Proteus species, Enterococcus species, Citrobacter species, and other organisms for 5每10%. Similar etiologic agents are found in Europe and Brazil. The spectrum of agents causing uncomplicated pyelonephritis is similar, with E. coli predominating. In complicated UTI (e.g., CAUTI), E. coli remains the predominant organism, but other aerobic gram-negative rods, such as Klebsiella species, Proteus species, Citrobacter species, Acinetobacter species, Morganella species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, also are frequently isolated. Gram-positive bacteria (e.g., enterococci and Staphylococcus aureus), and yeasts are also important pathogens in complicated UTI. Data on etiology and resistance are generally obtained from laboratory surveys and should be understood in the context that organism identification is performed only in cases in which urine is sent for culture〞i.e., typically when complicated UTI or pyelonephritis is suspected. The available data demonstrate a worldwide increase in the resistance of E. coli to antibiotics commonly used to treat UTI. North American and European surveys of E. coli isolates from women with acute cystitis have documented rates of resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) greater than 20% and rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin between 5% and 10% in some regions. Since resistance rates vary by local geographic region, with individual patient characteristics, and over time, it is important to use current and local data when choosing a treatment regimen.

Pathogenesis

The urinary tract can be viewed as an anatomic unit united by a continuous column of urine extending from the urethra to the kidneys. In the majority of UTIs, bacteria establish infection by ascending from the urethra to the bladder. Continuing ascent up the ureter to the kidney is the pathway for most renal parenchymal infections. However, introduction of bacteria into the bladder does not inevitably lead to sustained and symptomatic infection. The interplay of host, pathogen, and environmental factors determines whether tissue invasion and symptomatic infection will ensue (Fig. 288-1). For example, bacteria often enter the bladder after sexual intercourse, but normal voiding and innate host defense mechanisms in the bladder eliminate these organisms. Any foreign body in the urinary tract, such as a urinary catheter or stone, provides an inert surface for bacterial colonization. Abnormal micturition and/or significant residual urine volume promotes true infection. In the simplest of terms, anything that increases the likelihood of bacteria entering the bladder and staying there increases the risk of UTI.

Pathogenesis of urinary tract infection. The relationship between specific host, pathogen, and environmental factors determines the clinical outcome.
 
 

Bacteria can also gain access to the urinary tract through the bloodstream. However, hematogenous spread accounts for <2% of documented UTIs and usually results from bacteremia caused by relatively virulent organisms, such as Salmonella and S. aureus. Indeed, the isolation of either of these pathogens from a patient without a catheter or other instrumentation warrants a search for a bloodstream source. Hematogenous infections may produce focal abscesses or areas of pyelonephritis within a kidney and result in positive urine cultures. The pathogenesis of candiduria is distinct in that the hematogenous route is common. The presence of Candida in the urine of a noninstrumented immunocompetent patient implies either genital contamination or potentially widespread visceral dissemination.

Environmental Factors

Vaginal Ecology

In women, vaginal ecology is an important environmental factor affecting the risk of UTI. Colonization of the vaginal introitus and perirurethral area with organisms from the intestinal flora (usually E. coli) is the critical initial step in the pathogenesis of UTI. Sexual intercourse is associated with an increased risk of vaginal colonization with E. coli and thereby increases the risk of UTI. Nonoxynol-9 in spermicide is toxic to the normal vaginal microflora and thus is likewise associated with an increased risk of E. coli vaginal colonization and bacteriuria. In postmenopausal women, the previously predominant vaginal lactobacilli are replaced with gram-negative colonization. The use of topical estrogens to prevent UTI in postmenopausal women is controversial; given the side effects of systemic hormone replacement, oral estrogens should not be used to prevent UTI.

Anatomic and Functional Abnormalities

Any condition that permits urinary stasis or obstruction predisposes the individual to UTI. Foreign bodies such as stones or urinary catheters provide an inert surface for bacterial colonization and formation of a persistent biofilm. Thus, vesicoureteral reflux, ureteral obstruction secondary to prostatic hypertrophy, neurogenic bladder, and urinary diversion surgery create an environment favorable to UTI. In persons with such conditions, E. coli strains lacking typical urinary virulence factors are often the cause of infection. Inhibition of ureteral peristalsis and decreased ureteral tone leading to vesicoureteral reflux are important in the pathogenesis of pyelonephritis in pregnant women. Anatomic factors〞specifically, the distance of the urethra from the anus〞are considered to be the primary reason why UTI is predominantly an illness of young women rather than of young men.

Host Factors

The genetic background of the host influences the individual's susceptibility to recurrent UTI, at least among women. A familial disposition to UTI and to pyelonephritis is well documented. Women with recurrent UTI are more likely to have had their first UTI before age 15 years and to have a maternal history of UTI. A component of the underlying pathogenesis of this familial predisposition to recurrent UTI may be persistent vaginal colonization with E. coli, even during asymptomatic periods. Vaginal and periurethral mucosal cells from women with recurrent UTI bind threefold more uropathogenic bacteria than do mucosal cells from women without recurrent infection. Epithelial cells from susceptible women may possess specific types or greater numbers of receptors to which E. coli can bind, thereby facilitating colonization and invasion. Mutations in host response genes (e.g., those coding for Toll-like receptors and the interleukin 8 receptor) have also been linked to recurrent UTI and pyelonephritis. Polymorphisms in the interleukin 8每specific receptor gene CXCR1 are associated with increased susceptibility to pyelonephritis. Lower-level expression of CXCR1 on the surface of neutrophils impairs neutrophil-dependent host defense against bacterial invasion of the renal parenchyma.

Microbial Factors

An anatomically normal urinary tract presents a stronger barrier to infection than a compromised urinary tract. Thus, strains of E. coli that cause invasive symptomatic infection of the urinary tract in otherwise normal hosts often possess and express genetic virulence factors, including surface adhesins that mediate binding to specific receptors on the surface of uroepithelial cells. The best-studied adhesins are the P fimbriae, hairlike protein structures that interact with a specific receptor on renal epithelial cells. (The letter P denotes the ability of these fimbriae to bind to blood group antigen P, which contains a d-galactose-d-galactose residue.) P fimbriae are important in the pathogenesis of pyelonephritis and subsequent bloodstream invasion from the kidney.

Another adhesin is the type 1 pilus (fimbria), which all E. coli strains possess but not all E. coli strains express. Type 1 pili are thought to play a key role in initiating E. coli bladder infection; they mediate binding to uroplakins on the luminal surface of bladder uroepithelial cells. The binding of type 1 fimbriae of E. coli to receptors on uroepithelial cells initiates a complex series of signaling events that leads to apoptosis and exfoliation of uroepithelial cells, with the attached E. coli organisms carried away in the urine.

Approach to the Patient: Clinical Manifestations

The most important issue to be addressed when a UTI is suspected is the characterization of the clinical syndrome as ABU, uncomplicated cystitis, pyelonephritis, prostatitis, or complicated UTI. This information will shape the diagnostic and therapeutic approach.

Asymptomatic Bacteriuria

A diagnosis of ABU can be considered only when the patient does not have local or systemic symptoms referable to the urinary tract. The clinical presentation is usually that of a patient who undergoes a screening urine culture for a reason unrelated to the genitourinary tract and is incidentally found to have bacteriuria. The presence of systemic signs or symptoms such as fever, altered mental status, and leukocytosis in the setting of a positive urine culture does not merit a diagnosis of symptomatic UTI unless other potential etiologies have been considered.

Cystitis

The typical symptoms of cystitis are dysuria, urinary frequency, and urgency. Nocturia, hesitancy, suprapubic discomfort, and gross hematuria are often noted as well. Unilateral back or flank pain is generally an indication that the upper urinary tract is involved. Fever is also an indication of invasive infection of either the kidney or the prostate.

Pyelonephritis

Mild pyelonephritis can present as low-grade fever with or without lower-back or costovertebral-angle pain, whereas severe pyelonephritis can manifest as high fever, rigors, nausea, vomiting, and flank and/or loin pain. Symptoms are generally acute in onset, and symptoms of cystitis may not be present. Fever is the main feature distinguishing cystitis and pyelonephritis. The fever of pyelonephritis typically exhibits a high, spiking "picket-fence" pattern and resolves over 72 h of therapy. Bacteremia develops in 20每30% of cases of pyelonephritis. Patients with diabetes may present with obstructive uropathy associated with acute papillary necrosis when the sloughed papillae obstruct the ureter. Papillary necrosis may also be evident in some cases of pyelonephritis complicated by obstruction, sickle cell disease, analgesic nephropathy, or combinations of these conditions. In the rare cases of bilateral papillary necrosis, a rapid rise in the serum creatinine level may be the first indication of the condition. Emphysematous pyelonephritis is a particularly severe form of the disease that is associated with the production of gas in renal and perinephric tissues and occurs almost exclusively in diabetic patients (Fig. 288-2). Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis occurs when chronic urinary obstruction (often by staghorn calculi), together with chronic infection, leads to suppurative destruction of renal tissue (Fig. 288-3). On pathologic examination, the residual renal tissue frequently has a yellow coloration with infiltration by lipid-laden macrophages. Pyelonephritis can also be complicated by intraparenchymal abscess formation; this situation should be suspected when a patient has continued fever and/or bacteremia despite antibacterial therapy.

Ramnani, MD, Virginia Urology Pathology Laboratory, Richmond, VA.)
 
 

Prostatitis

Prostatitis includes both infectious and noninfectious abnormalities of the prostate gland. Infections can be acute or chronic, are almost always bacterial in nature, and are far less common than the noninfectious entity of chronic pelvic pain syndrome (formerly known as chronic prostatitis). Acute bacterial prostatitis presents as dysuria, frequency, and pain in the prostatic, pelvic, or perineal area. Fever and chills are usually present, and symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction are common. Chronic bacterial prostatitis presents more insidiously as recurrent episodes of cystitis, sometimes with associated pelvic and perineal pain. Men who present with recurrent cystitis should be evaluated for a prostatic focus.

Complicated UTI

Complicated UTI presents as a symptomatic episode of cystitis or pyelonephritis in a man or woman with an anatomic predisposition to infection, with a foreign body in the urinary tract, or with factors predisposing to a delayed response to therapy.

Diagnostic Tools

History

The diagnosis of any the UTI syndromes or ABU begins with a detailed history (Fig. 288-4). The history given by the patient has a high predictive value in uncomplicated cystitis. A meta-analysis evaluating the probability of acute UTI on the basis of history and physical findings concluded that, in women presenting with at least one symptom of UTI (dysuria, frequency, hematuria, or back pain) and without complicating factors, the probability of acute cystitis or pyelonephritis is 50%. The even higher rates of accuracy of self-diagnosis among women with recurrent UTI probably account for the success of patient-initiated treatment of recurrent cystitis. If vaginal discharge and complicating factors are absent and risk factors for UTI are present, then the probability of UTI is close to 90%, and no laboratory evaluation is needed. Similarly, a combination of dysuria and urinary frequency in the absence of vaginal discharge increases the probability of UTI to 96%. Further laboratory evaluation with dipstick testing or urine culture is not necessary in such patients before the initiation of definitive therapy.

Figure 288-4

When the patient's history is applied as a diagnostic tool, it is important to recall that the studies included in the meta-analysis cited above did not enroll children, adolescents, pregnant women, men, or patients with complicated UTI. One significant concern is that sexually transmitted disease〞that caused by Chlamydia trachomatis in particular〞may be inappropriately treated as UTI. This concern is particularly relevant for female patients under the age of 25. The differential diagnosis to be considered when women present with dysuria includes cervicitis (C. trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae), vaginitis (Candida albicans, Trichomonas vaginalis), herpetic urethritis, interstitial cystitis, and noninfectious vaginal or vulvar irritation. Women with more than one sexual partner and inconsistent use of condoms are at high risk for both UTI and sexually transmitted disease, and symptoms alone do not always distinguish between these conditions.

The Urine Dipstick Test, Urinalysis, and Urine Culture

Useful diagnostic tools include the urine dipstick test and urinalysis, both of which provide point-of-care information, and the urine culture, which can retrospectively confirm a prior diagnosis. Understanding the parameters of the dipstick test is important in interpreting its results. Only members of the family Enterobacteriaceae convert nitrate to nitrite, and enough nitrite must accumulate in the urine to reach the threshold of detection. If a woman with acute cystitis is forcing fluids and voiding frequently, the dipstick test for nitrite is less likely to be positive, even when E. coli is present. The leukocyte esterase test detects this enzyme in the host's polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the urine, whether the cells are intact or lysed. Many reviews have attempted to describe the diagnostic accuracy of dipstick testing. The bottom line for clinicians is that a urine dipstick test can confirm the diagnosis of uncomplicated cystitis in a patient with a reasonably high pretest probability of this disease. Either nitrite or leukocyte esterase positivity can be interpreted as a positive result. Blood in the urine may also suggest a diagnosis of UTI. A dipstick test negative for both nitrite and leukocyte esterase in the same type of patient should prompt consideration of other explanations for the patient's symptoms and collection of urine for culture. A negative dipstick test is not sufficiently sensitive to rule out bacteriuria in pregnant women, in whom it is important to detect all episodes of bacteriuria. Performance characteristics of the dipstick test differ in men (highly specific) and in noncatheterized nursing home residents (highly sensitive).

Urine microscopy reveals pyuria in nearly all cases of cystitis and hematuria in ~30% of cases. In current practice, most hospital laboratories use an automated system rather than manual examination for urine microscopy. A machine aspirates a sample of the urine and then classifies the particles in the urine by size, shape, contrast, light scatter, volume, and other properties. These automated systems can be overwhelmed by high numbers of dysmorphic red blood cells, white blood cells, or crystals; in general, counts of bacteria are less accurate than are counts of red and white blood cells. Our clinical recommendation is that the patient's symptoms and presentation should outweigh an incongruent result on automated urinalysis.

The detection of bacteria in a urine culture is the diagnostic "gold standard" for UTI; unfortunately, however, culture results do not become available until 24 h after the patient's presentation. Identifying specific organism(s) can require an additional 24 h. Studies of women with symptoms of cystitis have found that a colony count threshold of >102 bacteria/mL is more sensitive (95%) and specific (85%) than a threshold of 105/mL for the diagnosis of acute cystitis in women. In men, the minimal level indicating infection appears to be 103/mL. Urine specimens frequently become contaminated with the normal microbial flora of the distal urethra, vagina, or skin. These contaminants can grow to high numbers if the collected urine is allowed to stand at room temperature. In most instances, a culture that yields mixed bacterial species is contaminated except in settings of long-term catheterization, chronic urinary retention, or the presence of a fistula between the urinary tract and the gastrointestinal or genital tract.

Diagnosis

The approach to diagnosis is influenced by which of the clinical UTI syndromes is suspected (Fig. 288-4).

Uncomplicated Cystitis in Women

Uncomplicated cystitis in women can be treated on the basis of history alone. However, if the symptoms are not specific or if a reliable history cannot be obtained, then a urine dipstick test should be performed. A positive nitrite or leukocyte esterase result in a woman with one symptom of UTI increases the probability of UTI from 50% to ~80%, and empirical treatment can be considered without further testing. In this setting, a negative dipstick result does not rule out UTI, and a urine culture, close clinical follow-up, and possibly a pelvic examination are recommended. These recommendations are made with the caveat that factors associated with complicated UTI, such as pregnancy, are not present.

Cystitis in Men

The signs and symptoms of cystitis in men are similar to those in women, but this disease differs in several important ways in the male population. Collection of urine for culture is strongly recommended when a man has symptoms of UTI, as the documentation of bacteriuria can differentiate the less common syndromes of acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis from the very common entity of chronic pelvic pain syndrome, which is not associated with bacteriuria and thus is not usually responsive to antibacterial therapy. If the diagnosis is unclear, localization cultures using the two- or four-glass Meares-Stamey test (urine collection after prostate massage) should be undertaken to differentiate between bacterial and nonbacterial prostatic syndromes, and the patient should be referred to a urologist. Men with febrile UTI often have an elevated serum level of prostate-specific antigen as well as an enlarged prostate and enlarged seminal vesicles on ultrasound〞findings indicative of prostate involvement. In 85 men with febrile UTI, symptoms of urinary retention, early recurrence of UTI, hematuria at follow-up, and voiding difficulties were predictive of surgically correctable disorders. Men with none of these symptoms had normal upper and lower urinary tracts on urologic workup.

Asymptomatic Bacteriuria

The diagnosis of ABU involves both microbiologic and clinical criteria. The microbiologic criterion is usually 105 bacterial cfu/mL except in catheter-associated disease, in which case 102 cfu/mL is the cutoff. The clinical criterion is that the person has no signs or symptoms referable to UTI.

Treatment: Urinary Tract Infections

Antimicrobial therapy is warranted for any symptomatic UTI. The choice of antimicrobial agent and the dose and duration of therapy depend on the site of infection and the presence or absence of complicating conditions. Each category of UTI warrants a different approach based on the particular clinical syndrome.

Uncomplicated Cystitis in Women

Since the species and antimicrobial susceptibilities of the bacteria that cause acute uncomplicated cystitis are highly predictable, many episodes of uncomplicated cystitis can be managed over the telephone (Fig. 288-4). Most patients with other UTI syndromes require further diagnostic evaluation. Although the risk of serious complications with telephone management appears to be low, studies of telephone management algorithms generally have involved otherwise healthy white women who are at low risk for complications of UTI.

In 1999, TMP-SMX was recommended as the first-line agent for treatment of uncomplicated UTI in the published guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Antibiotic resistance among uropathogens causing uncomplicated cystitis has since increased, appreciation of the importance of collateral damage (as defined below) has increased, and newer agents have been studied. Unfortunately, there is no longer a single best agent for acute uncomplicated cystitis.

Collateral damage refers to the adverse ecologic effects of antimicrobial therapy, including killing of the normal flora and selection of drug-resistant organisms. Outbreaks of Clostridium difficile infection offer an example of collateral damage in the hospital environment. The implication of collateral damage in this context is that a drug that is highly efficacious for the treatment of UTI is not necessarily the optimal first-line agent if it also has pronounced secondary effects on the normal flora or is likely to change resistance patterns. Drugs used for UTI that have a minimal effect on fecal flora include pivmecillinam, fosfomycin, and nitrofurantoin. In contrast, trimethoprim, TMP-SMX, quinolones, and ampicillin affect the fecal flora more significantly; these drugs are notably the agents for which rising resistance levels have been documented.

Several effective therapeutic regimens are available for acute uncomplicated cystitis in women (Table 288-1). Well-studied first-line agents include TMP-SMX and nitrofurantoin. Second-line agents include fluoroquinolone and -lactam compounds. Single-dose fosfomycin treatment for acute cystitis is widely used in Europe but has produced mixed results in randomized trials. Pivmecillinam is not currently available in the United States or Canada but is a popular agent in some European countries. The pros and cons of other therapies are discussed briefly below.

Note: Efficacy rates are averages or ranges calculated from the data and studies included in the 2010 Infectious Diseases Society of America/European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Guideline for Treatment of Uncomplicated UTI. TMP-SMX, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; DS, double-strength.
 

Traditionally, TMP-SMX has been recommended as first-line treatment for acute cystitis, and it remains appropriate to consider the use of this drug in regions with resistance rates not exceeding 20%. TMP-SMX resistance has clinical significance: in TMP-SMX-treated patients with resistant isolates, the time to symptom resolution is longer and rates of both clinical and microbiologic failure are higher. Individual host factors associated with an elevated risk of UTI caused by a strain of E. coli resistant to TMP-SMX include recent use of TMP-SMX or another antimicrobial agent and recent travel to an area with high rates of TMP-SMX resistance. The optimal setting for empirical use of TMP-SMX is uncomplicated UTI in a female patient who has an established relationship with the practitioner and who can thus seek further care if her symptoms do not respond promptly.

Resistance to nitrofurantoin remains low despite >60 years of use. Since this drug affects bacterial metabolism in multiple pathways, several mutational steps are required for the development of resistance. Nitrofurantoin remains highly active against E. coli and most non每E. coli isolates. Proteus, Pseudomonas, Serratia, Enterobacter, and yeasts are all intrinsically resistant to this drug. Although nitrofurantoin has traditionally been prescribed as a 7-day regimen, similar microbiologic and clinical efficacies are noted with a 5-day course of nitrofurantoin or a 3-day course of TMP-SMX for treatment of women with acute cystitis; 3-day courses of nitrofurantoin are not recommended for acute cystitis. Nitrofurantoin does not reach significant levels in tissue and cannot be used to treat pyelonephritis.

Most fluoroquinolones are highly effective for short-course therapy for cystitis; the exception is moxifloxacin, which does not achieve adequate urinary levels. The fluoroquinolones commonly used for UTI include ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. The main concern about fluoroquinolone use for acute cystitis is the propagation of fluoroquinolone resistance, not only among uropathogens but also among other organisms causing more serious and difficult-to-treat infections at other sites. Fluoroquinolone use is also a factor driving the emergence of C. difficile outbreaks in hospital settings. Most experts now call for restricting fluoroquinolones to specific instances of uncomplicated cystitis in which other antimicrobial agents are not suitable. Quinolone use in the elderly has been associated with an increased risk of Achilles tendon rupture.

Except for pivmecillinam, -lactam agents generally have not performed as well as TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones in acute cystitis. Rates of pathogen eradication are lower and relapse rates are higher with -lactam drugs. The generally accepted explanation is that -lactams fail to eradicate uropathogens from the vaginal reservoir. A proposed role for intracellular biofilm communities is intriguing. Many strains of E. coli that are resistant to TMP-SMX are also resistant to amoxicillin and cephalexin; thus, these drugs should be used only for patients infected with susceptible strains.

Urinary analgesics are appropriate in certain situations to speed resolution of bladder discomfort. The urinary tract analgesic phenazopyridine is widely used but can cause significant nausea. Combination analgesics containing urinary antiseptics (methenamine, methylene blue), a urine-acidifying agent (sodium phosphate), and an antispasmodic agent (hyoscyamine) are also available.

Pyelonephritis

Since patients with pyelonephritis have tissue-invasive disease, the treatment regimen chosen should have a very high likelihood of eradicating the causative organism and should reach therapeutic blood levels quickly. High rates of TMP-SMX-resistant E. coli in patients with pyelonephritis have made fluoroquinolones the first-line therapy for acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis. Whether the fluoroquinolones are given orally or parenterally depends on the patient's tolerance for oral intake. A randomized clinical trial demonstrated that a 7-day course of therapy with oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily, with or without an initial IV 400-mg dose) was highly effective for the initial management of pyelonephritis in the outpatient setting. Oral TMP-SMX (one double-strength tablet twice daily for 14 days) is also effective for treatment of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis if the uropathogen is known to be susceptible. If the pathogen's susceptibility is not known and TMP-SMX is used, an initial IV 1-g dose of ceftriaxone is recommended. Oral -lactam agents are less effective than the fluoroquinolones and should be used with caution and close follow-up. Options for parenteral therapy for uncomplicated pyelonephritis include fluoroquinolones, an aminoglycoside with or without ampicillin, an extended-spectrum cephalosporin with or without an aminoglycoside, or a carbapenem. Combinations of a -lactam and a -lactamase inhibitor (e.g., ampicillin-sulbactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and piperacillin-tazobactam) or imipenem-cilastatin can be used in patients with more complicated histories, previous episodes of pyelonephritis, or recent urinary tract manipulations; in general, the treatment of such patients should be guided by urine culture results. Once the patient has responded clinically, oral therapy should be substituted for parenteral therapy.

UTI in Pregnant Women

Nitrofurantoin, ampicillin, and the cephalosporins are considered relatively safe in early pregnancy. One retrospective case-control study suggesting an association between nitrofurantoin and birth defects awaits confirmation. Sulfonamides should clearly be avoided both in the first trimester (because of possible teratogenic effects) and near term (because of a possible role in the development of kernicterus). Fluoroquinolones are avoided because of possible adverse effects on fetal cartilage development. Ampicillin and the cephalosporins have been used extensively in pregnancy and are the drugs of choice for the treatment of asymptomatic or symptomatic UTI in this group of patients. For pregnant women with overt pyelonephritis, parenteral -lactam therapy with or without aminoglycosides is the standard of care.

UTI in Men

Since the prostate is involved in the majority of cases of febrile UTI in men, the goal in these patients is to eradicate the prostatic infection as well as the bladder infection. In men with apparently uncomplicated UTI, a 7- to 14-day course of a fluoroquinolone or TMP-SMX is recommended. If acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected, antimicrobial therapy should be initiated after urine and blood are obtained for cultures. Therapy can be tailored to urine culture results and should be continued for 2每4 weeks. For documented chronic bacterial prostatitis, a 4- to 6-week course of antibiotics is often necessary. Recurrences, which are not uncommon in chronic prostatitis, often warrant a 12-week course of treatment.

Complicated UTI

Complicated UTI (other than that discussed above) occurs in a heterogeneous group of patients with a wide variety of structural and functional abnormalities of the urinary tract and kidneys. The range of species and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents are likewise heterogeneous. As a consequence, therapy for complicated UTI must be individualized and guided by urine culture results. Frequently, a patient with complicated UTI will have prior urine culture data that can be used to guide empirical therapy while current culture results are awaited. Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is treated with nephrectomy. Percutaneous drainage can be used as the initial therapy in emphysematous pyelonephritis and can be followed by elective nephrectomy as needed. Papillary necrosis with obstruction requires intervention to relieve the obstruction and to preserve renal function.

Asymptomatic Bacteriuria

Treatment of ABU does not decrease the frequency of symptomatic infections or complications except in pregnant women, persons undergoing urologic surgery, and perhaps neutropenic patients and renal transplant recipients. Treatment of ABU in pregnant women and patients undergoing urologic procedures should be directed by urine culture results. In all other populations, screening for and treatment of ABU are discouraged. The majority of cases of catheter-associated bacteriuria are asymptomatic and do not warrant antimicrobial therapy.

Catheter-Associated UTI

Multiple institutions have released guidelines for the treatment of CAUTI, which is defined by bacteriuria and symptoms in a catheterized patient. The signs and symptoms either are localized to the urinary tract or can include otherwise unexplained systemic manifestations, such as fever. The accepted threshold for bacteriuria varies from 103 cfu/mL to 105 cfu/mL.

The formation of biofilm〞a living layer of uropathogens〞on the urinary catheter is central to the pathogenesis of CAUTI and affects both therapeutic and preventive strategies. Organisms in a biofilm are relatively resistant to killing by antibiotics, and eradication of a catheter-associated biofilm is difficult without removal of the device itself. Furthermore, because catheters provide a conduit for bacteria to enter the bladder, bacteriuria is inevitable with long-term catheter use.

The typical signs and symptoms of UTI, including pain, urgency, dysuria, fever, peripheral leukocytosis, and pyuria, have less predictive value for the diagnosis of infection in catheterized patients. Furthermore, the presence of bacteria in the urine of a patient who is febrile and catheterized does not necessarily predict CAUTI, and other explanations for the fever should be considered.

The etiology of CAUTI is diverse, and urine culture results are essential to guide treatment. Fairly good evidence supports the practice of catheter change during treatment for CAUTI. The goal is to remove biofilm-associated organisms that could serve as a nidus for reinfection. Pathology studies reveal that many patients with long-term catheters have occult pyelonephritis. A randomized trial in persons with spinal cord injury who were practicing intermittent catheterization found that relapse was more common after 3 days of therapy than after 14 days. In general, a 7- to 14-day course of antibiotics is recommended, but further studies on the optimal duration of therapy are needed.

In the setting of long-term catheter use, systemic antibiotics, bladder-acidifying agents, antimicrobial bladder washes, topical disinfectants, and antimicrobial drainage-bag solutions have all been ineffective at preventing the onset of bacteriuria and have been associated with the emergence of resistant organisms. The best strategy for prevention of CAUTI is to avoid insertion of unnecessary catheters and to remove catheters once they are no longer necessary. Evidence is insufficient to recommend suprapubic catheters and condom catheters as alternatives to indwelling urinary catheters as a means to prevent CAUTI. However, intermittent catheterization may be preferable to long-term indwelling urethral catheterization in certain populations (e.g., spinal cord每injured persons) to prevent both infectious and anatomic complications. Antimicrobial catheters impregnated with silver or nitrofurazone have not been shown to provide significant clinical benefit in terms of reducing rates of symptomatic UTI.

Candiduria

The appearance of Candida in the urine is an increasingly common complication of indwelling catheterization, particularly for patients in the intensive care unit, those taking broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs, and those with underlying diabetes mellitus. C. albicans is still the most common isolate, although C. glabrata and other non-albicans species are also isolated frequently. The clinical presentation varies from an asymptomatic laboratory finding to pyelonephritis and even sepsis. In asymptomatic patients, removal of the urethral catheter results in resolution of candiduria in more than one-third of cases. Treatment is recommended for patients who have symptomatic cystitis or pyelonephritis and for those who are at high risk for disseminated disease. High-risk patients include those with neutropenia, those who are undergoing urologic manipulation, and low-birth-weight infants. Fluconazole (200每400 mg/d for 14 days) achieves high levels in urine and is the first-line regimen for Candida infections of the urinary tract. The newer azoles and echinocandins are characterized by only low-level urinary excretion and thus are not recommended, although cases of successful eradication of candiduria with some of these agents have been reported. For Candida isolates with high levels of resistance to fluconazole, oral flucytosine and/or parenteral amphotericin B are options. Bladder irrigation with amphotericin B generally is not recommended.

Prevention of Recurrent UTI in Women

Recurrence of uncomplicated cystitis in reproductive-age women is common, and a preventive strategy is indicated if recurrent UTIs are interfering with a patient's lifestyle. The threshold of two or more symptomatic episodes per year is not absolute; decisions about interventions should take the patient's preferences into account.

Three prophylactic strategies are available: continuous, postcoital, or patient-initiated therapy. Continuous prophylaxis and postcoital prophylaxis usually entail low doses of TMP-SMX, a fluoroquinolone, or nitrofurantoin. These regimens are all highly effective during the period of active antibiotic intake. Typically, a prophylactic regimen is prescribed for 6 months and then discontinued, at which point the rate of recurrent UTI often returns to baseline. If bothersome infections recur, the prophylactic program can be reinstituted for a longer period.

Patient-initiated therapy involves supplying the patient with materials for urine culture and self-medication with a course of antibiotics at the first symptoms of infection. The urine culture is refrigerated and delivered to the physician's office for confirmation of the diagnosis. When an established and reliable patient-provider relationship exists, the urine culture can be omitted as long as the symptomatic episodes respond completely to short-course therapy and are not followed by relapse.

Prognosis

Cystitis is a risk factor for recurrent cystitis and pyelonephritis. ABU is common among elderly and catheterized patients but does not in itself increase the risk of death. The relationships among recurrent UTI, chronic pyelonephritis, and renal insufficiency have been widely studied. In the absence of anatomic abnormalities, recurrent infection in children and adults does not lead to chronic pyelonephritis or to renal failure. Moreover, infection does not play a primary role in chronic interstitial nephritis; the primary etiologic factors in this condition are analgesic abuse, obstruction, reflux, and toxin exposure. In the presence of underlying renal abnormalities (particularly obstructing stones), infection as a secondary factor can accelerate renal parenchymal damage. In spinal cord每injured patients, use of a long-term indwelling bladder catheter is a well-documented risk factor for bladder cancer. Chronic bacteriuria resulting in chronic inflammation is one possible explanation for this observation.

Urinary Tract Obstruction: Introduction

Obstruction to the flow of urine, with attendant stasis and elevation in urinary tract pressure, impairs renal and urinary conduit functions and is a common cause of acute and chronic kidney disease (obstructive nephropathy). With early relief of obstruction, the defects in function usually disappear completely. However, chronic obstruction may produce permanent loss of renal mass (renal atrophy) and excretory capability, as well as enhanced susceptibility to local infection and stone formation. Early diagnosis and prompt therapy are, therefore, essential to minimize the otherwise devastating effects of obstruction on kidney structure and function.
 
Etiology

Obstruction to urine flow can result from intrinsic or extrinsic mechanical blockade as well as from functional defects not associated with fixed occlusion of the urinary drainage system. Mechanical obstruction can occur at any level of the urinary tract, from the renal calyces to the external urethral meatus. Normal points of narrowing, such as the ureteropelvic and ureterovesical junctions, bladder neck, and urethral meatus, are common sites of obstruction. When obstruction is above the level of the bladder, unilateral dilatation of the ureter (hydroureter) and renal pyelocalyceal system (hydronephrosis) occur; lesions at or below the level of the bladder cause bilateral involvement.

Common forms of obstruction are listed in Table 289-1. Childhood causes include congenital malformations, such as narrowing of the ureteropelvic junction and abnormal insertion of the ureter into the bladder, the most common cause. Vesicoureteral reflux in the absence of urinary tract infection or bladder neck obstruction often resolves with age. Reinsertion of the ureter into the bladder is indicated if reflux is severe and unlikely to improve spontaneously, if renal function deteriorates, or if urinary tract infections recur despite chronic antimicrobial therapy. Vesicoureteral reflux may cause prenatal hydronephrosis and, if severe, can lead to recurrent urinary infections and renal scarring in childhood. Posterior urethral valves are the most common cause of bilateral hydronephrosis in boys. In adults, urinary tract obstruction (UTO) is due mainly to acquired defects. Pelvic tumors, calculi, and urethral stricture predominate. Ligation of, or injury to, the ureter during pelvic or colonic surgery can lead to hydronephrosis which, if unilateral, may remain undetected. Obstructive uropathy may also result from extrinsic neoplastic (carcinoma of cervix or colon) or inflammatory disorders. Lymphomas and pelvic or colonic neoplasms with retroperitoneal involvement are causes of ureteral obstruction.

Functional impairment of urine flow usually results from disorders that involve both the ureter and bladder. Causes include neurogenic bladder, often with adynamic ureter, and vesicoureteral reflux. Reflux in children may result in severe unilateral or bilateral hydroureter and hydronephrosis. Urinary retention may be the consequence of alpha-adrenergic and anticholinergic agents, as well as opiates. Hydronephrosis in pregnancy is due to relaxational effects of progesterone on smooth muscle of the renal pelvis, as well as ureteral compression by the enlarged uterus.
 
Clinical Features and Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology and clinical features of UTO are summarized in Table 289-2. Pain, the symptom that most commonly leads to medical attention, is due to distention of the collecting system or renal capsule. Pain severity is influenced more by the rate at which distention develops than by the degree of distention. Acute supravesical obstruction, as from a stone lodged in a ureter (see Chap. 287), is associated with excruciating pain, known as renal colic. This pain often radiates to the lower abdomen, testes, or labia. By contrast, more insidious causes of obstruction, such as chronic narrowing of the ureteropelvic junction, may produce little or no pain and yet result in total destruction of the affected kidney. Flank pain that occurs only with micturition is pathognomonic of vesicoureteral reflux. Hesitancy and straining to initiate the urinary stream, postvoid dribbling, urinary frequency, and incontinence are common with obstruction at or below the level of the bladder.

Obstruction of urine flow results in an increase in hydrostatic pressures proximal to the site of obstruction. It is this buildup of pressure that leads to the accompanying pain, the distention of the collecting system in the kidney, and elevated intratubular pressures that initiate tubular dysfunction. As the increased hydrostatic pressure is expressed in the urinary space of the glomeruli, further filtration decreases or stops completely.

Azotemia develops when overall excretory function is impaired, often in the setting of bladder outlet obstruction, bilateral renal pelvic or ureteric obstruction, or unilateral disease in a patient with a solitary functioning kidney. Complete bilateral obstruction should be suspected when acute renal failure is accompanied by anuria. Any patient with renal failure otherwise unexplained, or with a history of nephrolithiasis, hematuria, diabetes mellitus, prostatic enlargement, pelvic surgery, trauma, or tumor should be evaluated for UTO.

In the acute setting, partial, bilateral obstruction may mimic prerenal azotemia with concentrated urine and sodium retention. However, with more prolonged obstruction, symptoms of polyuria and nocturia commonly accompany partial UTO and result from diminished renal concentrating ability. Impairment of transcellular salt reabsorption in the proximal tubule, medullary thick ascending limb of Henle, and collecting duct cells is due to down-regulation of transport proteins including the Na+, K+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), NaK2Cl cotransporter (NKCC) in the thick ascending limb, and the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) in collecting duct cells. Consequences include failure to produce urine free of salt (natriuresis), and loss of medullary hypertonicity producing a urinary concentrating defect. In addition to direct effects on renal transport mechanisms, increased PGE2 (due to induction of COX-2), angiotensin-II (with its downregulation of Na+ transporters), and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) (due to volume expansion in the azotemic patient) contribute to the decreased salt reabsorption along the nephron.

Dysregulation of aquaporin-2 water channels in the collecting duct contributes to the polyuria. The defect usually does not improve with administration of vasopressin and is therefore a form of acquired nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

Wide fluctuations in urine output in a patient with azotemia should always raise the possibility of intermittent or partial UTO. If fluid intake is inadequate, severe dehydration and hypernatremia may develop. However, as with other causes of poor renal function, excesses of salt and water intake may result in edema and hyponatremia.

Partial bilateral UTO often results in acquired distal renal tubular acidosis, hyperkalemia, and renal salt wasting. The H+-ATPase, situated on the apical membrane of the intercalated cells of the collecting duct, is critical for distal H+ secretion. The trafficking of intracellular H+ pumps from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane is disrupted in UTO. The decreased function of the ENaC, in the apical membrane of neighboring collecting duct principal cells, contributes to decreased Na+ reabsorption (salt-wasting), decreased electronegativity of the tubule lumen, and therefore decreased K+ secretion via K+ channels (hyperkalemia) and H+ secretion via the H+-ATPases [distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA)]. Proximal tubule ammoniagenesis, important to the elimination of H+ as NH4+, is impaired. These defects in tubule function are often accompanied by renal tubulointerstitial damage. Azotemia with hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis should prompt consideration of UTO.

The renal interstitium becomes edematous and infiltrated with mononuclear inflammatory cells early in UTO. Later, interstitial fibrosis and atrophy of the papillae and medulla occur and precede these processes in the cortex. The increase in angiotensin-II noted in UTO contributes to the inflammatory response and fibroblast accumulation through mechanisms involving profibrotic cytokines. With time, this process leads to chronic kidney damage.

UTO must always be considered in patients with urinary tract infections or urolithiasis. Urinary stasis encourages the growth of organisms. Urea-splitting bacteria are associated with magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) calculi. Hypertension is frequent in acute and subacuteunilateral obstruction and is usually a consequence of increased release of renin by the involved kidney. Chronic kidney disease from bilateral UTO, often associated with extracellular volume expansion, may result in significant hypertension. Erythrocytosis, an infrequent complication of obstructive uropathy, is secondary to increased erythropoietin production.
 
Diagnosis

A history of difficulty in voiding, pain, infection, or change in urinary volume is common. Evidence for distention of the kidney or urinary bladder can often be obtained by palpation and percussion of the abdomen. A careful rectal and genital examination may reveal enlargement or nodularity of the prostate, abnormal rectal sphincter tone, or a rectal or pelvic mass.

Urinalysis may reveal hematuria, pyuria, and bacteriuria. The urine sediment is often normal, even when obstruction leads to marked azotemia and extensive structural damage. An abdominal scout film may detect nephrocalcinosis or a radiopaque stone. As indicated in Fig. 289-1, if UTO is suspected, a bladder catheter should be inserted. Abdominal ultrasonography should be performed to evaluate renal and bladder size, as well as pyelocalyceal contour. Ultrasonography is approximately 90% specific and sensitive for detection of hydronephrosis. False-positive results are associated with diuresis, renal cysts, or the presence of an extrarenal pelvis, a normal congenital variant. Congenital ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction may be mistaken for renal cystic disease. Hydronephrosis may be absent on ultrasound when obstruction is less than 48 hours in duration or associated with volume contraction, staghorn calculi, retroperitoneal fibrosis, or infiltrative renal disease. Duplex Doppler ultrasonography may detect an increased resistive index in urinary obstruction.

Recent advances in technology have led to alternatives to the once standard intravenous urogram in the further evaluation of UTO. The high-resolution multidetector row CT scan in particular has advantages of visualizing the retroperitoneum, as well as identifying both intrinsic and extrinsic sites of obstruction. Noncontrast CT scans improve visualization of the urinary tract in the patient with renal impairment and are safer for patients at risk for contrast nephropathy. MR urography is a promising technique but at this time not superior to the CT scan and carries the risk of certain gadolinium agents in patients with renal insufficiency, i.e., nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. The intravenous urogram may define the site of obstruction and demonstrate dilatation of the calyces, renal pelvis, and ureter above the obstruction. The ureter may be tortuous in chronic obstruction. Radionuclide scans are able to give differential renal function but give less anatomic detail than CT or intravenous urography (IVU).

To facilitate visualization of a suspected lesion in a ureter or renal pelvis, retrograde or antegrade urography should be attempted. These procedures do not carry risk of contrast-induced acute renal failure in patients with renal insufficiency. The retrograde approach involves catheterization of the involved ureter under cystoscopic control, while the antegrade technique necessitates percutaneous placement of a catheter into the renal pelvis. While the antegrade approach may provide immediate decompression of a unilateral obstructing lesion, many urologists initially attempt the retrograde approach unless the catheterization is unsuccessful.

Voiding cystourethrography is of value in the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux and bladder neck and urethral obstructions. Postvoiding films reveal residual urine. Endoscopic visualization by the urologist often permits precise identification of lesions involving the urethra, prostate, bladder, and ureteral orifices.

Treatment: Urinary Tract Obstruction

UTO complicated by infection requires immediate relief of obstruction to prevent development of generalized sepsis and progressive renal damage. Sepsis necessitates prompt urologic intervention. Drainage may be achieved by nephrostomy, ureterostomy, or ureteral, urethral, or suprapubic catheterization. Prolonged antibiotic treatment may be necessary. Chronic or recurrent infections in a poorly functioning obstructed kidney may necessitate nephrectomy. When infection is not present, surgery is often delayed until acid-base, fluid, and electrolyte status is restored. Nevertheless, the site of obstruction should be ascertained as soon as feasible. Elective relief of obstruction is usually recommended in patients with urinary retention, recurrent urinary tract infections, persistent pain, or progressive loss of renal function. Benign prostatic hypertrophy may be treated medically with alpha adrenergic blockers and 5-reductase inhibitors. Functional obstruction secondary to neurogenic bladder may be decreased with the combination of frequent voiding and cholinergic drugs.
 
Prognosis

With relief of obstruction, the prognosis regarding return of renal function depends largely on whether irreversible renal damage has occurred. When obstruction is not relieved, the course will depend mainly on whether the obstruction is complete or incomplete and bilateral or unilateral, as well as whether or not urinary tract infection is also present. Complete obstruction with infection can lead to total destruction of the kidney within days. Partial return of glomerular filtration rate may follow relief of complete obstruction of 1 and 2 weeks' duration, but after 8 weeks of obstruction, recovery is unlikely. In the absence of definitive evidence of irreversibility, every effort should be made to decompress the obstruction in the hope of restoring renal function at least partially. A renal radionuclide scan, performed after a prolonged period of decompression, may be used to predict the reversibility of renal dysfunction.
 
Postobstructive Diuresis

Relief of bilateral, but not unilateral, complete obstruction commonly results in polyuria, which may be massive. The urine is usually hypotonic and may contain large amounts of sodium chloride, potassium, phosphate, and magnesium. The natriuresis is due in part to the excretion of retained urea (osmotic diuresis), natriuretic factors accumulated during uremia and depressed salt and water reabsorption when urine flow is reestablished. In the majority of patients this diuresis results in the appropriate excretion of the excesses of retained salt and water. When extracellular volume and composition return to normal, the diuresis usually abates spontaneously. Occasionally, iatrogenic expansion of extracellular volume is responsible for, or sustains, the diuresis observed in the postobstructive period. Replacement with intravenous fluids in amounts less than urinary losses usually avoids this complication. More aggressive fluid management is required in the setting of hypovolemia, hypotension, or disturbances in serum electrolyte concentrations.

The loss of electrolyte-free water with urea may result in hypernatremia. Serum and urine sodium and osmolal concentrations should guide the use of appropriate intravenous replacement. Often replacement with 0.45% saline is required. Relief of obstruction may be followed by urinary salt and water losses severe enough to provoke profound dehydration and vascular collapse. In these patients, decreased tubule reabsorptive capacity is probably responsible for the marked diuresis. Appropriate therapy in such patients includes intravenous administration of salt-containing solutions to replace sodium and volume deficits.
