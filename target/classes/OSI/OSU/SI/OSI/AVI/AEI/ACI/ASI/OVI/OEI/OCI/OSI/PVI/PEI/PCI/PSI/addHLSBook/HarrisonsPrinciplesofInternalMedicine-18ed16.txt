Principles of Endocrinology: Introduction

The management of endocrine disorders requires a broad understanding of intermediary metabolism, reproductive physiology, bone metabolism, and growth. Accordingly, the practice of endocrinology is intimately linked to a conceptual framework for understanding hormone secretion, hormone action, and principles of feedback control. The endocrine system is evaluated primarily by measuring hormone concentrations, arming the clinician with valuable diagnostic information. Most disorders of the endocrine system are amenable to effective treatment once the correct diagnosis is determined. Endocrine deficiency disorders are treated with physiologic hormone replacement; hormone excess conditions, which usually are due to benign glandular adenomas, are managed by removing tumors surgically or reducing hormone levels medically.
 
Scope of Endocrinology

The specialty of endocrinology encompasses the study of glands and the hormones they produce. The term endocrine was coined by Starling to contrast the actions of hormones secreted internally (endocrine) with those secreted externally (exocrine) or into a lumen, such as the gastrointestinal tract. The term hormone, derived from a Greek phrase meaning "to set in motion," aptly describes the dynamic actions of hormones as they elicit cellular responses and regulate physiologic processes through feedback mechanisms.

Unlike many other specialties in medicine, it is not possible to define endocrinology strictly along anatomic lines. The classic endocrine glands〞pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, pancreatic islets, adrenals, and gonads〞communicate broadly with other organs through the nervous system, hormones, cytokines, and growth factors. In addition to its traditional synaptic functions, the brain produces a vast array of peptide hormones, and this has led to the discipline of neuroendocrinology. Through the production of hypothalamic releasing factors, the central nervous system (CNS) exerts a major regulatory influence over pituitary hormone secretion (Chap. 339). The peripheral nervous system stimulates the adrenal medulla. The immune and endocrine systems are also intimately intertwined. The adrenal hormone cortisol is a powerful immunosuppressant. Cytokines and interleukins (ILs) have profound effects on the functions of the pituitary, adrenal, thyroid, and gonads. Common endocrine diseases such as autoimmune thyroid disease and Type 1 diabetes mellitus are caused by dysregulation of immune surveillance and tolerance. Less common diseases such as polyglandular failure, Addison's disease, and lymphocytic hypophysitis also have an immunologic basis.

The interdigitation of endocrinology with physiologic processes in other specialties sometimes blurs the role of hormones. For example, hormones play an important role in maintenance of blood pressure, intravascular volume, and peripheral resistance in the cardiovascular system. Vasoactive substances such as catecholamines, angiotensin II, endothelin, and nitric oxide are involved in dynamic changes of vascular tone in addition to their multiple roles in other tissues. The heart is the principal source of atrial natriuretic peptide, which acts in classic endocrine fashion to induce natriuresis at a distant target organ (the kidney). Erythropoietin, a traditional circulating hormone, is made in the kidney and stimulates erythropoiesis in bone marrow (Chap. 57). The kidney is also integrally involved in the renin-angiotensin axis (Chap. 342) and is a primary target of several hormones, including parathyroid hormone (PTH), mineralocorticoids, and vasopressin. The gastrointestinal tract produces a surprising number of peptide hormones, such as cholecystokinin, ghrelin, gastrin, secretin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide, among many others. Adipose tissue produces leptin, which acts centrally to control appetite. Carcinoid and islet tumors can secrete excessive amounts of these hormones, leading to specific clinical syndromes (Chap. 350). Many of these gastrointestinal hormones are also produced in the CNS, where their functions are poorly understood. As hormones such as inhibin, ghrelin, and leptin are discovered, they become integrated into the science and practice of medicine on the basis of their functional roles rather than their tissues of origin.

Characterization of hormone receptors frequently reveals unexpected relationships to factors in nonendocrine disciplines. The growth hormone (GH) and leptin receptors, for example, are members of the cytokine receptor family. The G protein每coupled receptors (GPCRs), which mediate the actions of many peptide hormones, are used in numerous physiologic processes, including vision, smell, and neurotransmission.
 
Nature of Hormones

Hormones can be divided into five major classes: (1) amino acid derivatives such as dopamine, catecholamine, and thyroid hormone; (2) small neuropeptides such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), somatostatin, and vasopressin; (3) large proteins such as insulin, luteinizing hormone (LH), and PTH produced by classic endocrine glands; (4) steroid hormones such as cortisol and estrogen that are synthesized from cholesterol-based precursors; and (5) vitamin derivatives such as retinoids (vitamin A) and vitamin D. A variety of peptide growth factors, most of which act locally, share actions with hormones. As a rule, amino acid derivatives and peptide hormones interact with cell-surface membrane receptors. Steroids, thyroid hormones, vitamin D, and retinoids are lipid-soluble and interact with intracellular nuclear receptors.

Hormone and Receptor Families

Many hormones and receptors can be grouped into families, reflecting their structural similarities (Table 338-1). The evolution of these families generates diverse but highly selective pathways of hormone action. Recognition of these relationships allows extrapolation of information gleaned from one hormone or receptor to other family members.

The glycoprotein hormone family, consisting of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), LH, and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), illustrates many features of related hormones. The glycoprotein hormones are heterodimers that have the  subunit in common; the  subunits are distinct and confer specific biologic actions. The overall three-dimensional architecture of the  subunits is similar, reflecting the locations of conserved disulfide bonds that restrain protein conformation. The cloning of the -subunit genes from multiple species suggests that this family arose from a common ancestral gene, probably by gene duplication and subsequent divergence to evolve new biologic functions.

As the hormone families enlarge and diverge, their receptors must co-evolve if new biologic functions are to be derived. Related GPCRs, for example, have evolved for each of the glycoprotein hormones. These receptors are structurally similar, and each is coupled to the Gs signaling pathway. However, there is minimal overlap of hormone binding. For example, TSH binds with high specificity to the TSH receptor but interacts minimally with the LH or the FSH receptor. Nonetheless, there can be subtle physiologic consequences of hormone cross-reactivity with other receptors. Very high levels of hCG during pregnancy stimulate the TSH receptor and increase thyroid hormone levels, resulting in a compensatory decrease in TSH.

Insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and IGF-II have structural similarities that are most apparent when precursor forms of the proteins are compared. In contrast to the high degree of specificity seen with the glycoprotein hormones, there is moderate cross-talk among the members of the insulin/IGF family. High concentrations of an IGF-II precursor produced by certain tumors (e.g., sarcomas) can cause hypoglycemia, partly because of binding to insulin and IGF-I receptors (Chap. 100). High concentrations of insulin also bind to the IGF-I receptor, perhaps accounting for some of the clinical manifestations seen in severe insulin resistance.

Another important example of receptor cross-talk is seen with PTH and parathyroid hormone每related peptide (PTHrP) (Chap. 353). PTH is produced by the parathyroid glands, whereas PTHrP is expressed at high levels during development and by a variety of tumors (Chap. 100). These hormones have amino acid sequence similarity, particularly in their amino-terminal regions. Both hormones bind to a single PTH receptor that is expressed in bone and kidney. Hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia therefore may result from excessive production of either hormone, making it difficult to distinguish hyperparathyroidism from hypercalcemia of malignancy solely on the basis of serum chemistries. However, sensitive and specific assays for PTH and PTHrP now allow these disorders to be distinguished more readily.

Based on their specificities for DNA binding sites, the nuclear receptor family can be subdivided into type 1 receptors (GR, MR, AR, ER, PR) that bind steroids and type 2 receptors (TR, VDR, RAR, PPAR) that bind thyroid hormone, vitamin D, retinoic acid, or lipid derivatives. Certain functional domains in nuclear receptors, such as the zinc finger DNA-binding domains, are highly conserved. However, selective amino acid differences within this domain confer DNA sequence specificity. The hormone-binding domains are more variable, providing great diversity in the array of small molecules that bind to different nuclear receptors. With few exceptions, hormone binding is highly specific for a single type of nuclear receptor. One exception involves the glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors. Because the mineralocorticoid receptor also binds glucocorticoids with high affinity, an enzyme (11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) in renal tubular cells inactivates glucocorticoids, allowing selective responses to mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone. However, when very high glucocorticoid concentrations occur, as in Cushing's syndrome, the glucocorticoid degradation pathway becomes saturated, allowing excessive cortisol levels to exert mineralocorticoid effects (sodium retention, potassium wasting). This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndromes (Chap. 342). Another example of relaxed nuclear receptor specificity involves the estrogen receptor, which can bind an array of compounds, some of which have little apparent structural similarity to the high-affinity ligand estradiol. This feature of the estrogen receptor makes it susceptible to activation by "environmental estrogens" such as resveratrol, octylphenol, and many other aromatic hydrocarbons. However, this lack of specificity provides an opportunity to synthesize a remarkable series of clinically useful antagonists (e.g., tamoxifen) and selective estrogen response modulators (SERMs) such as raloxifene. These compounds generate distinct conformations that alter receptor interactions with components of the transcription machinery (see below), thereby conferring their unique actions.

Hormone Synthesis and Processing

The synthesis of peptide hormones and their receptors occurs through a classic pathway of gene expression: transcription  mRNA  protein  posttranslational protein processing  intracellular sorting, followed by membrane integration or secretion (Chap. 61).

Many hormones are embedded within larger precursor polypeptides that are proteolytically processed to yield the biologically active hormone. Examples include proopiomelanocortin (POMC)  ACTH; proglucagon  glucagon; proinsulin  insulin; and pro-PTH  PTH, among others. In many cases, such as POMC and proglucagon, these precursors generate multiple biologically active peptides. It is provocative that hormone precursors are typically inactive, presumably adding an additional level of regulatory control. Prohormone conversion occurs not only for peptide hormones but also for certain steroids (testosterone  dihydrotestosterone) and thyroid hormone (T4  T3).

Hormone precursor processing is intimately linked to intracellular sorting pathways that transport proteins to appropriate vesicles and enzymes, resulting in specific cleavage steps, followed by protein folding and translocation to secretory vesicles. Hormones destined for secretion are translocated across the endoplasmic reticulum under the guidance of an amino-terminal signal sequence that subsequently is cleaved. Cell-surface receptors are inserted into the membrane via short segments of hydrophobic amino acids that remain embedded within the lipid bilayer. During translocation through the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum, hormones and receptors are also subject to a variety of posttranslational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can alter protein conformation, modify circulating half-life, and alter biologic activity.

Synthesis of most steroid hormones is based on modifications of the precursor, cholesterol. Multiple regulated enzymatic steps are required for the synthesis of testosterone (Chap. 346), estradiol (Chap. 347), cortisol (Chap. 342), and vitamin D (Chap. 352). This large number of synthetic steps predisposes to multiple genetic and acquired disorders of steroidogenesis.

Although endocrine genes contain regulatory DNA elements similar to those found in many other genes, their exquisite control by other hormones also necessitates the presence of specific hormone response elements. For example, the TSH genes are repressed directly by thyroid hormones acting through the thyroid hormone receptor (TR), a member of the nuclear receptor family. Steroidogenic enzymegene expression requires specific transcription factors, such as steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), acting in conjunction with signals transmitted by trophic hormones (e.g., ACTH or LH). For some hormones, substantial regulation occurs at the level of translational efficiency. Insulin biosynthesis, although it requires ongoing gene transcription, is regulated primarily at the translational level in response to elevated levels of glucose or amino acids.

Hormone Secretion, Transport, and Degradation

The circulating level of a hormone is determined by its rate of secretion and its circulating half-life. After protein processing, peptide hormones (GnRH, insulin, GH) are stored in secretory granules. As these granules mature, they are poised beneath the plasma membrane for imminent release into the circulation. In most instances, the stimulus for hormone secretion is a releasing factor or neural signal that induces rapid changes in intracellular calcium concentrations, leading to secretory granule fusion with the plasma membrane and release of its contents into the extracellular environment and bloodstream. Steroid hormones, in contrast, diffuse into the circulation as they are synthesized. Thus, their secretory rates are closely aligned with rates of synthesis. For example, ACTH and LH induce steroidogenesis by stimulating the activity of steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein (transports cholesterol into the mitochondrion) along with other rate-limiting steps (e.g., cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, CYP11A1) in the steroidogenic pathway.

Hormone transport and degradation dictate the rapidity with which a hormonal signal decays. Some hormonal signals are evanescent (e.g., somatostatin), whereas others are longer-lived (e.g., TSH). Because somatostatin exerts effects in virtually every tissue, a short half-life allows its concentrations and actions to be controlled locally. Structural modifications that impair somatostatin degradation have been useful for generating long-acting therapeutic analogues such as octreotide (Chap. 339). In contrast, the actions of TSH are highly specific for the thyroid gland. Its prolonged half-life accounts for relatively constant serum levels even though TSH is secreted in discrete pulses.

An understanding of circulating hormonehalf-life is important for achieving physiologic hormone replacement, as the frequency of dosing and the time required to reach steady state are intimately linked to rates of hormone decay. T4, for example, has a circulating half-life of 7 days. Consequently, >1 month is required to reach a new steady state, and single daily doses are sufficient to achieve constant hormone levels. T3, in contrast, has a half-life of 1 day. Its administration is associated with more dynamic serum levels, and it must be administered two to three times per day. Similarly, synthetic glucocorticoids vary widely in their half-lives; those with longer half-lives (e.g., dexamethasone) are associated with greater suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Most protein hormones [e.g., ACTH, GH, prolactin (PRL), PTH, LH] have relatively short half-lives (<20 min), leading to sharp peaks of secretion and decay. The only accurate way to profile the pulse frequency and amplitude of these hormones is to measure levels in frequently sampled blood (every 10 min or less) over long durations (8每24 h). Because this is not practical in a clinical setting, an alternative strategy is to pool three to four samples drawn at about 30-min intervals or interpret the results in the context of a relatively wide normal range. Rapid hormone decay is useful in certain clinical settings. For example, the short half-life of PTH allows the use of intraoperative PTH determinations to confirm successful removal of an adenoma. This is particularly valuable diagnostically when there is a possibility of multicentric disease or parathyroid hyperplasia, as occurs with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) or renal insufficiency.

Many hormones circulate in association with serum-binding proteins. Examples include (1) T4 and T3 binding to thyroxine- binding globulin (TBG), albumin, and thyroxine-binding prealbumin (TBPA); (2) cortisol binding to cortisol-binding globulin (CBG); (3) androgen and estrogen binding to sex hormone每binding globulin (SHBG) [also called testosterone-binding globulin (TeBG)]; (4) IGF-I and -II binding to multiple IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs); (5) GH interactions with GH-binding protein (GHBP), a circulating fragment of the GH receptor extracellular domain; and (6) activin binding to follistatin. These interactions provide a hormonal reservoir, prevent otherwise rapid degradation of unbound hormones, restrict hormone access to certain sites (e.g., IGFBPs), and modulate the unbound, or "free," hormone concentrations. Although a variety of binding protein abnormalities have been identified, most have few clinical consequences aside from creating diagnostic problems. For example, TBG deficiency can reduce total thyroid hormone levels greatly, but the free concentrations of T4 and T3 remain normal. Liver disease and certain medications can also influence binding protein levels (e.g., estrogen increases TBG) or cause displacement of hormones from binding proteins (e.g., salsalate displaces T4 from TBG). In general, only unbound hormone is available to interact with receptors and thus elicit a biologic response. Short-term perturbations in binding proteins change the free hormone concentration, which in turn induces compensatory adaptations through feedback loops. SHBG changes in women are an exception to this self-correcting mechanism. When SHBG decreases because of insulin resistance or androgen excess, the unbound testosterone concentration is increased, potentially leading to hirsutism (Chap. 49). The increased unbound testosterone level does not result in an adequate compensatory feedback correction because estrogen, not testosterone, is the primary regulator of the reproductive axis.

An additional exception to the unbound hormone hypothesis involves megalin, a member of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family that serves as an endocytotic receptor for carrier-bound vitamins A and D and SHBG-bound androgens and estrogens. After internalization, the carrier proteins are degraded in lysosomes and release their bound ligands within the cells. Membrane transporters have also been identified for thyroid hormones.

Hormone degradation can be an important mechanism for regulating concentrations locally. As noted above, 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inactivates glucocorticoids in renal tubular cells, preventing actions through the mineralocorticoid receptor. Thyroid hormone deiodinases convert T4 to T3 and can inactivate T3. During development, degradation of retinoic acid by Cyp26b1 prevents primordial germ cells in the male from entering meiosis, as occurs in the female ovary.
 
Hormone Action through Receptors

Receptors for hormones are divided into two major classes: membrane and nuclear. Membrane receptors primarily bind peptide hormones and catecholamines. Nuclear receptors bind small molecules that can diffuse across the cell membrane, such as steroids and vitamin D. Certain general principles apply to hormone-receptor interactions regardless of the class of receptor. Hormones bind to receptors with specificity and an affinity that generally coincides with the dynamic range of circulating hormone concentrations. Low concentrations of free hormone (usually 1012 to 109M) rapidly associate and dissociate from receptors in a bimolecular reaction such that the occupancy of the receptor at any given moment is a function of hormone concentration and the receptor's affinity for the hormone. Receptor numbers vary greatly in different target tissues, providing one of the major determinants of specific cellular responses to circulating hormones. For example, ACTH receptors are located almost exclusively in the adrenal cortex, and FSH receptors are found predominantely in the gonads. In contrast, insulin and TRs are widely distributed, reflecting the need for metabolic responses in all tissues.

Membrane Receptors

Membrane receptors for hormones can be divided into several major groups: (1) seven transmembrane GPCRs, (2) tyrosine kinase receptors, (3) cytokine receptors, and (4) serine kinase receptors (Fig. 338-1). The seven transmembrane GPCR family binds a remarkable array of hormones, including large proteins (e.g., LH, PTH), small peptides (e.g., TRH, somatostatin), catecholamines (epinephrine, dopamine), and even minerals (e.g., calcium). The extracellular domains of GPCRs vary widely in size and are the major binding site for large hormones. The transmembrane- spanning regions are composed of hydrophobic -helical domains that traverse the lipid bilayer. Like some channels, these domains are thought to circularize and form a hydrophobic pocket into which certain small ligands fit. Hormone binding induces conformational changes in these domains, transducing structural changes to the intracellular domain, which is a docking site for G proteins.

The large family of G proteins, so named because they bind guanine nucleotides [guanosine triphosphate (GTP), guanosine diphosphate (GDP)], provides great diversity for coupling receptors to different signaling pathways. G proteins form a heterotrimeric complex that is composed of various  and  subunits. The  subunit contains the guanine nucleotide每binding site and hydrolyzes GTP  GDP. The  subunits are tightly associated and modulate the activity of the  subunit as well as mediating their own effector signaling pathways. G protein activity is regulated by a cycle that involves GTP hydrolysis and dynamic interactions between the  and  subunits. Hormone binding to the receptor induces GDP dissociation, allowing G to bind GTP and dissociate from the  complex. Under these conditions, the G subunit is activated and mediates signal transduction through various enzymes, such as adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C. GTP hydrolysis to GDP allows reassociation with the  subunits and restores the inactive state. As described below, a variety of endocrinopathies result from G protein mutations or from mutations in receptors that modify their interactions with G proteins. G proteins interact with other cellular proteins, including kinases, channels, G protein每coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), and arrestins, that mediate signaling as well as receptor desensitization and recycling.

The tyrosine kinase receptors transduce signals for insulin and a variety of growth factors, such as IGF-I, epidermal growth factor (EGF), nerve growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor. The cysteine-rich extracellular ligand-binding domains contain growth factor binding sites. After ligand binding, this class of receptors undergoes autophosphorylation, inducing interactions with intracellular adaptor proteins such as Shc and insulin receptor substrates. In the case of the insulin receptor, multiple kinases are activated, including the Raf-Ras-MAPK and the Akt/protein kinase B pathways. The tyrosine kinase receptors play a prominent role in cell growth and differentiation as well as in intermediary metabolism.

The GH and PRL receptors belong to the cytokine receptor family. Analogous to the tyrosine kinase receptors, ligand binding induces receptor interaction with intracellular kinases〞the Janus kinases (JAKs), which phosphorylate members of the signal transduction and activators of transcription (STAT) family〞as well as with other signaling pathways (Ras, PI3-K, MAPK). The activated STAT proteins translocate to the nucleus and stimulate expression of target genes.

The serine kinase receptors mediate the actions of activins, transforming growth factor , m邦llerian-inhibiting substance (MIS, also known as anti-m邦llerian hormone, AMH), and bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs). This family of receptors (consisting of type I and II subunits) signals through proteins termed smads (fusion of terms for Caenorhabditis elegans sma + mammalian mad). Like the STAT proteins, the smads serve a dual role of transducing the receptor signal and acting as transcription factors. The pleomorphic actions of these growth factors dictate that they act primarily in a local (paracrine or autocrine) manner. Binding proteins such as follistatin (which binds activin and other members of this family) function to inactivate the growth factors and restrict their distribution.

Nuclear Receptors

The family of nuclear receptors has grown to nearly 100 members, many of which are still classified as orphan receptors because their ligands, if they exist, have not been identified (Fig. 338-2). Otherwise, most nuclear receptors are classified on the basis of the nature of their ligands. Though all nuclear receptors ultimately act to increase or decrease gene transcription, some (e.g., glucocorticoid receptor) reside primarily in the cytoplasm, whereas others (e.g., thyroid hormone receptor) are always located in the nucleus. After ligand binding, the cytoplasmically localized receptors translocate to the nucleus. There is growing evidence that certain nuclear receptors (e.g., glucocorticoid, estrogen) can also act at the membrane or in the cytoplasm to activate or repress signal transduction pathways, providing a mechanism for cross-talk between membrane and nuclear receptors.

The structures of nuclear receptors have been studied extensively, including by x-ray crystallography. The DNA binding domain, consisting of two zinc fingers, contacts specific DNA recognition sequences in target genes. Most nuclear receptors bind to DNA as dimers. Consequently, each monomer recognizes an individual DNA motif, referred to as a "half-site." The steroid receptors, including the glucocorticoid, estrogen, progesterone, and androgen receptors, bind to DNA as homodimers. Consistent with this twofold symmetry, their DNA recognition half-sites are palindromic. The thyroid, retinoid, peroxisome proliferator activated, and vitamin D receptors bind to DNA preferentially as heterodimers in combination with retinoid X receptors (RXRs). Their DNA half-sites are arranged as direct repeats.

The carboxy-terminal hormone-binding domain mediates transcriptional control. For type II receptors such as thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and retinoic acid receptor (RAR), co-repressor proteins bind to the receptor in the absence of ligand and silence gene transcription. Hormone binding induces conformational changes, triggering the release of co-repressors and inducing the recruitment of coactivators that stimulate transcription. Thus, these receptors are capable of mediating dramatic changes in the level of gene activity. Certain disease states are associated with defective regulation of these events. For example, mutations in the TR prevent co-repressor dissociation, resulting in a dominant form of hormone resistance (Chap. 341). In promyelocytic leukemia, fusion of RAR to other nuclear proteins causes aberrant gene silencing and prevents normal cellular differentiation. Treatment with retinoic acid reverses this repression and allows cellular differentiation and apoptosis to occur. Most type 1 steroid receptors interact weakly with co-repressors, but ligand binding still induces interactions with an array of coactivators. X-ray crystallography shows that various SERMs induce distinct estrogen receptor conformations. The tissue-specific responses caused by these agents in breast, bone, and uterus appear to reflect distinct interactions with coactivators. The receptor-coactivator complex stimulates gene transcription by several pathways, including (1) recruitment of enzymes (histone acetyl transferases) that modify chromatin structure, (2) interactions with additional transcription factors on the target gene, and (3) direct interactions with components of the general transcription apparatus to enhance the rate of RNA polymerase II每mediated transcription. Studies of nuclear receptor-mediated transcription show that these are dynamic events that involve relatively rapid (e.g., 30每60 min) cycling of transcription complexes on any specific target gene.
 
Functions of Hormones

The functions of individual hormones are described in detail in subsequent chapters. Nevertheless, it is useful to illustrate how most biologic responses require integration of several different hormone pathways. The physiologic functions of hormones can be divided into three general areas: (1) growth and differentiation, (2) maintenance of homeostasis, and (3) reproduction.

Growth

Multiple hormones and nutritional factors mediate the complex phenomenon of growth (Chap. 339). Short stature may be caused by GH deficiency, hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, precocious puberty, malnutrition, chronic illness, or genetic abnormalities that affect the epiphyseal growth plates (e.g., FGFR3 and SHOX mutations). Many factors (GH, IGF-I, thyroid hormones) stimulate growth, whereas others (sex steroids) lead to epiphyseal closure. Understanding these hormonal interactions is important in the diagnosis and management of growth disorders. For example, delaying exposure to high levels of sex steroids may enhance the efficacy of GH treatment.

Maintenance of Homeostasis

Though virtually all hormones affect homeostasis, the most important among them are the following:

Thyroid hormone〞controls about 25% of basal metabolism in most tissues

Cortisol〞exerts a permissive action for many hormones in addition to its own direct effects

PTH〞regulates calcium and phosphorus levels

Vasopressin〞regulates serum osmolality by controlling renal free-water clearance

Mineralocorticoids〞control vascular volume and serum electrolyte (Na+, K+) concentrations

Insulin〞maintains euglycemia in the fed and fasted states

The defense against hypoglycemia is an impressive example of integrated hormone action (Chap. 345). In response to the fasted state and falling blood glucose, insulin secretion is suppressed, resulting in decreased glucose uptake and enhanced glycogenolysis, lipolysis, proteolysis, and gluconeogenesis to mobilize fuel sources. If hypoglycemia develops (usually from insulin administration or sulfonylureas), an orchestrated counterregulatory response occurs〞glucagon and epinephrine rapidly stimulate glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, whereas GH and cortisol act over several hours to raise glucose levels and antagonize insulin action.

Although free-water clearance is controlled primarily by vasopressin, cortisol and thyroid hormone are also important for facilitating renal tubular responses to vasopressin (Chap. 340). PTH and vitamin D function in an interdependent manner to control calcium metabolism (Chap. 352). PTH stimulates renal synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, which increases calcium absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and enhances PTH action in bone. Increased calcium, along with vitamin D, feeds back to suppress PTH, thus maintaining calcium balance.

Depending on the severity of a specific stress and whether it is acute or chronic, multiple endocrine and cytokine pathways are activated to mount an appropriate physiologic response. In severe acute stress such as trauma or shock, the sympathetic nervous system is activated and catecholamines are released, leading to increased cardiac output and a primed musculoskeletal system. Catecholamines also increase mean blood pressure and stimulate glucose production. Multiple stress-induced pathways converge on the hypothalamus, stimulating several hormones, including vasopressin and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). These hormones, in addition to cytokines (tumor necrosis factor , IL-2, IL-6), increase ACTH and GH production. ACTH stimulates the adrenal gland, increasing cortisol, which in turn helps sustain blood pressure and dampen the inflammatory response. Increased vasopressin acts to conserve free water.

Reproduction

The stages of reproduction include (1) sex determination during fetal development (Chap. 349); (2) sexual maturation during puberty (Chaps. 346 and 347); (3) conception, pregnancy, lactation, and child rearing (Chap. 347); and (4) cessation of reproductive capability at menopause (Chap. 348). Each of these stages involves an orchestrated interplay of multiple hormones, a phenomenon well illustrated by the dynamic hormonal changes that occur during each 28-day menstrual cycle. In the early follicular phase, pulsatile secretion of LH and FSH stimulates the progressive maturation of the ovarian follicle. This results in gradually increasing estrogen and progesterone levels, leading to enhanced pituitary sensitivity to GnRH, which, when combined with accelerated GnRH secretion, triggers the LH surge and rupture of the mature follicle. Inhibin, a protein produced by the granulosa cells, enhances follicular growth and feeds back to the pituitary to selectively suppress FSH without affecting LH. Growth factors such as EGF and IGF-I modulate follicular responsiveness to gonadotropins. Vascular endothelial growth factor and prostaglandins play a role in follicle vascularization and rupture.

During pregnancy, the increased production of prolactin, in combination with placentally derived steroids (e.g., estrogen and progesterone), prepares the breast for lactation. Estrogens induce the production of progesterone receptors, allowing for increased responsiveness to progesterone. In addition to these and other hormones involved in lactation, the nervous system and oxytocin mediate the suckling response and milk release.
 
Hormonal Feedback Regulatory Systems

Feedback control, both negative and positive, is a fundamental feature of endocrine systems. Each of the major hypothalamic-pituitary-hormone axes is governed by negative feedback, a process that maintains hormone levels within a relatively narrow range (Chap. 339). Examples of hypothalamic-pituitary negative feedback include (1) thyroid hormones on the TRH-TSH axis, (2) cortisol on the CRH-ACTH axis, (3) gonadal steroids on the GnRH-LH/FSH axis, and (4) IGF-I on the growth hormone每releasing hormone (GHRH)-GH axis (Fig. 338-3). These regulatory loops include both positive (e.g., TRH, TSH) and negative (e.g., T4, T3) components, allowing for exquisite control of hormone levels. As an example, a small reduction of thyroid hormone triggers a rapid increase of TRH and TSH secretion, resulting in thyroid gland stimulation and increased thyroid hormone production. When thyroid hormone reaches a normal level, it feeds back to suppress TRH and TSH, and a new steady state is attained. Feedback regulation also occurs for endocrine systems that do not involve the pituitary gland, such as calcium feedback on PTH, glucose inhibition of insulin secretion, and leptin feedback on the hypothalamus. An understanding of feedback regulation provides important insights into endocrine testing paradigms (see below).

Positive feedback control also occurs but is not well understood. The primary example is estrogen-mediated stimulation of the midcycle LH surge. Though chronic low levels of estrogen are inhibitory, gradually rising estrogen levels stimulate LH secretion. This effect, which is illustrative of an endocrine rhythm (see below), involves activation of the hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator. In addition, estrogen-primed gonadotropes are extraordinarily sensitive to GnRH, leading to amplification of LH release.

Paracrine and Autocrine Control

The previously mentioned examples of feedback control involve classic endocrine pathways in which hormones are released by one gland and act on a distant target gland. However, local regulatory systems, often involving growth factors, are increasingly recognized. Paracrine regulation refers to factors released by one cell that act on an adjacent cell in the same tissue. For example, somatostatin secretion by pancreatic islet  cells inhibits insulin secretion from nearby  cells. Autocrine regulation describes the action of a factor on the same cell from which it is produced. IGF-I acts on many cells that produce it, including chondrocytes, breast epithelium, and gonadal cells. Unlike endocrine actions, paracrine and autocrine control are difficult to document because local growth factor concentrations cannot be measured readily.

Anatomic relationships of glandular systems also greatly influence hormonal exposure: the physical organization of islet cells enhances their intercellular communication; the portal vasculature of the hypothalamic-pituitary system exposes the pituitary to high concentrations of hypothalamic releasing factors; testicular seminiferous tubules gain exposure to high testosterone levels produced by the interdigitated Leydig cells; the pancreas receives nutrient information and local exposure to peptide hormones (incretins) from the gastrointestinal tract; and the liver is the proximal target of insulin action because of portal drainage from the pancreas.

Hormonal Rhythms

The feedback regulatory systems described above are superimposed on hormonal rhythms that are used for adaptation to the environment. Seasonal changes, the daily occurrence of the light-dark cycle, sleep, meals, and stress are examples of the many environmental events that affect hormonal rhythms. The menstrual cycle is repeated on average every 28 days, reflecting the time required to follicular maturation and ovulation (Chap. 347). Essentially all pituitary hormone rhythms are entrained to sleep and to the circadian cycle, generating reproducible patterns that are repeated approximately every 24 h. The HPA axis, for example, exhibits characteristic peaks of ACTH and cortisol production in the early morning, with a nadir during the night. Recognition of these rhythms is important for endocrine testing and treatment. Patients with Cushing's syndrome characteristically exhibit increased midnight cortisol levels compared with normal individuals (Chap. 342). In contrast, morning cortisol levels are similar in these groups, as cortisol is normally high at this time of day in normal individuals. The HPA axis is more susceptible to suppression by glucocorticoids administered at night as they blunt the early-morning rise of ACTH. Understanding these rhythms allows glucocorticoid replacement that mimics diurnal production by administering larger doses in the morning than in the afternoon. Disrupted sleep rhythms can alter hormonal regulation. For example, sleep deprivation causes mild insulin resistance, food craving, and hypertension, which are reversible, at least in the short term.

Other endocrine rhythms occur on a more rapid time scale. Many peptide hormones are secreted in discrete bursts every few hours. LH and FSH secretion are exquisitely sensitive to GnRH pulse frequency. Intermittent pulses of GnRH are required to maintain pituitary sensitivity, whereas continuous exposure to GnRH causes pituitary gonadotrope desensitization. This feature of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadotrope axis forms the basis for using long-acting GnRH agonists to treat central precocious puberty or to decrease testosterone levels in the management of prostate cancer. It is important to be aware of the pulsatile nature of hormone secretion and the rhythmic patterns of hormone production in relating serum hormone measurements to normal values. For some hormones, integrated markers have been developed to circumvent hormonal fluctuations. Examples include 24-h urine collections for cortisol, IGF-I as a biologic marker of GH action, and HbA1c as an index of long-term (weeks to months) blood glucose control.

Often, one must interpret endocrine data only in the context of other hormones. For example, PTH levels typically are assessed in combination with serum calcium concentrations. A high serum calcium level in association with elevated PTH is suggestive of hyperparathyroidism, whereas a suppressed PTH in this situation is more likely to be caused by hypercalcemia of malignancy or other causes of hypercalcemia. Similarly, TSH should be elevated when T4 and T3 concentrations are low, reflecting reduced feedback inhibition. When this is not the case, it is important to consider secondary hypothyroidism, which is caused by a defect at the level of the pituitary.
 
Pathologic Mechanisms of Endocrine Disease

Endocrine diseases can be divided into three major types of conditions: (1) hormone excess, (2) hormone deficiency, and (3) hormone resistance (Table 338-2).

Causes of Hormone Excess

Syndromes of hormone excess can be caused by neoplastic growth of endocrine cells, autoimmune disorders, and excess hormone administration. Benign endocrine tumors, including parathyroid, pituitary, and adrenal adenomas, often retain the capacity to produce hormones, perhaps reflecting the fact that they are relatively well differentiated. Many endocrine tumors exhibit subtle defects in their "set points" for feedback regulation. For example, in Cushing's disease, impaired feedback inhibition of ACTH secretion is associated with autonomous function. However, the tumor cells are not completely resistant to feedback, as evidenced by ACTH suppression by higher doses of dexamethasone (e.g., high-dose dexamethasone test) (Chap. 342). Similar set point defects are also typical of parathyroid adenomas and autonomously functioning thyroid nodules.

The molecular basis of some endocrine tumors, such as the MEN syndromes (MEN 1, 2A, 2B), have provided important insights into tumorigenesis (Chap. 351). MEN 1 is characterized primarily by the triad of parathyroid, pancreatic islet, and pituitary tumors. MEN 2 predisposes to medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism. The MEN1 gene, located on chromosome 11q13, encodes a putative tumor-suppressor gene, menin. Analogous to the paradigm first described for retinoblastoma, the affected individual inherits a mutant copy of the MEN1 gene, and tumorigenesis ensues after a somatic "second hit" leads to loss of function of the normal MEN1 gene (through deletion or point mutations).

In contrast to inactivation of a tumor-suppressor gene, as occurs in MEN 1 and most other inherited cancer syndromes, MEN 2 is caused by activating mutations in a single allele. In this case, activating mutations of the RET protooncogene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, leads to thyroid C cell hyperplasia in childhood before the development of medullary thyroid carcinoma. Elucidation of this pathogenic mechanism has allowed early genetic screening for RET mutations in individuals at risk for MEN 2, permitting identification of those who may benefit from prophylactic thyroidectomy and biochemical screening for pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism.

Mutations that activate hormone receptor signaling have been identified in several GPCRs. For example, activating mutations of the LH receptor cause a dominantly transmitted form of male-limited precocious puberty, reflecting premature stimulation of testosterone synthesis in Leydig cells (Chap. 346). Activating mutations in these GPCRs are located predominantly in the transmembrane domains and induce receptor coupling to Gs even in the absence of hormone. Consequently, adenylate cyclase is activated, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels increase in a manner that mimics hormone action. A similar phenomenon results from activating mutations in Gs. When these mutations occur early in development, they cause McCune-Albright syndrome. When they occur only in somatotropes, the activating Gs mutations cause GH-secreting tumors and acromegaly (Chap. 339).

In autoimmune Graves' disease, antibody interactions with the TSH receptor mimic TSH action, leading to hormone overproduction (Chap. 341). Analogous to the effects of activating mutations of the TSH receptor, these stimulating autoantibodies induce conformational changes that release the receptor from a constrained state, thereby triggering receptor coupling to G proteins.

Causes of Hormone Deficiency

Most examples of hormone deficiency states can be attributed to glandular destruction caused by autoimmunity, surgery, infection, inflammation, infarction, hemorrhage, or tumor infiltration (Table 338-2). Autoimmune damage to the thyroid gland (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) and pancreatic islet  cells (Type 1 diabetes mellitus) is a prevalent cause of endocrine disease. Mutations in a number of hormones, hormone receptors, transcription factors, enzymes, and channels can also lead to hormone deficiencies.

Hormone Resistance

Most severe hormone resistance syndromes are due to inherited defects in membrane receptors, nuclear receptors, or the pathways that transduce receptor signals. These disorders are characterized by defective hormone action despite the presence of increased hormone levels. In complete androgen resistance, for example, mutations in the androgen receptor result in a female phenotypic appearance in genetic (XY) males, even though LH and testosterone levels are increased (Chap. 349). In addition to these relatively rare genetic disorders, more common acquired forms of functional hormone resistance include insulin resistance in Type 2 diabetes mellitus, leptin resistance in obesity, and GH resistance in catabolic states. The pathogenesis of functional resistance involves receptor downregulation and postreceptor desensitization of signaling pathways; functional forms of resistance are generally reversible.

Approach to the Patient: Endocrine Disease

Because most glands are relatively inaccessible, the examination usually focuses on the manifestations of hormone excess or deficiency as well as direct examination of palpable glands, such as the thyroid and gonads. For these reasons, it is important to evaluate patients in the context of their presenting symptoms, review of systems, family and social history, and exposure to medications that may affect the endocrine system. Astute clinical skills are required to detect subtle symptoms and signs suggestive of underlying endocrine disease. For example, a patient with Cushing's syndrome may manifest specific findings, such as central fat redistribution, striae, and proximal muscle weakness, in addition to features seen commonly in the general population, such as obesity, plethora, hypertension, and glucose intolerance. Similarly, the insidious onset of hypothyroidism〞with mental slowing, fatigue, dry skin, and other features〞can be difficult to distinguish from similar, nonspecific findings in the general population. Clinical judgment that is based on knowledge of disease prevalence and pathophysiology is required to decide when to embark on more extensive evaluation of these disorders. Laboratory testing plays an essential role in endocrinology by allowing quantitative assessment of hormone levels and dynamics. Radiologic imaging tests such as CT scan, MRI, thyroid scan, and ultrasound are also used for the diagnosis of endocrine disorders. However, these tests generally are employed only after a hormonal abnormality has been established by biochemical testing.

Hormone Measurements and Endocrine Testing

Immunoassays are the most important diagnostic tool in endocrinology, as they allow sensitive, specific, and quantitative determination of steady-state and dynamic changes in hormone concentrations. Immunoassays use antibodies to detect specific hormones. For many peptide hormones, these measurements are now configured to use two different antibodies to increase binding affinity and specificity. There are many variations of these assays; a common format involves using one antibody to capture the antigen (hormone) onto an immobilized surface and a second antibody, coupled to a chemiluminescent [immunochemiluminescent assay (ICMA)] or radioactive immunoradiometric assay (IRMA)] signal, to detect the antigen. These assays are sensitive enough to detect plasma hormone concentrations in the picomolar to nanomolar range, and they can readily distinguish structurally related proteins, such as PTH from PTHrP. A variety of other techniques are used to measure specific hormones, including mass spectroscopy, various forms of chromatography, and enzymatic methods; bioassays are now rarely used.

Most hormone measurements are based on plasma or serum samples. However, urinary hormone determinations remain useful for the evaluation of some conditions. Urinary collections over 24 h provide an integrated assessment of the production of a hormone or metabolite, many of which vary during the day. It is important to assure complete collections of 24-h urine samples; simultaneous measurement of creatinine provides an internal control for the adequacy of collection and can be used to normalize some hormone measurements. A 24-h urine free cortisol measurement largely reflects the amount of unbound cortisol, thus providing a reasonable index of biologically available hormone. Other commonly used urine determinations include 17-hydroxycorticosteroids, 17-ketosteroids, vanillylmandelic acid, metanephrine, catecholamines, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, and calcium.

The value of quantitative hormone measurements lies in their correct interpretation in a clinical context. The normal range for most hormones is relatively broad, often varying by a factor of two- to tenfold. The normal ranges for many hormones are sex- and age-specific. Thus, using the correct normative database is an essential part of interpreting hormone tests. The pulsatile nature of hormones and factors that can affect their secretion, such as sleep, meals, and medications, must also be considered. Cortisol values increase fivefold between midnight and dawn; reproductive hormone levels vary dramatically during the female menstrual cycle.

For many endocrine systems, much information can be gained from basal hormone testing, particularly when different components of an endocrine axis are assessed simultaneously. For example, low testosterone and elevated LH levels suggest a primary gonadal problem, whereas a hypothalamic-pituitary disorder is likely if both LH and testosterone are low. Because TSH is a sensitive indicator of thyroid function, it is generally recommended as a first-line test for thyroid disorders. An elevated TSH level is almost always the result of primary hypothyroidism, whereas a low TSH is most often caused by thyrotoxicosis. These predictions can be confirmed by determining the free thyroxine level. Elevated calcium and PTH levels suggest hyperparathyroidism, whereas PTH is suppressed in hypercalcemia caused by malignancy or granulomatous diseases. A suppressed ACTH in the setting of hypercortisolemia, or increased urine free cortisol, is seen with hyperfunctioning adrenal adenomas.

It is not uncommon, however, for baseline hormone levels associated with pathologic endocrine conditions to overlap with the normal range. In this circumstance, dynamic testing is useful to separate the two groups further. There are a multitude of dynamic endocrine tests, but all are based on principles of feedback regulation, and most responses can be remembered on the basis of the pathways that govern endocrine axes. Suppression tests are used in the setting of suspected endocrine hyperfunction. An example is the dexamethasone suppression test used to evaluate Cushing's syndrome (Chaps. 339 and 342). Stimulation tests generally are used to assess endocrine hypofunction. The ACTH stimulation test, for example, is used to assess the adrenal gland response in patients with suspected adrenal insufficiency. Other stimulation tests use hypothalamic-releasing factors such as CRH and GHRH to evaluate pituitary hormone reserve (Chap. 339). Insulin-induced hypoglycemia also evokes pituitary ACTH and GH responses. Stimulation tests based on reduction or inhibition of endogenous hormones are now used infrequently. Examples include metyrapone inhibition of cortisol synthesis and clomiphene inhibition of estrogen feedback.

Screening and Assessment of Common Endocrine Disorders

Many endocrine disorders are prevalent in the adult population (Table 338-3) and can be diagnosed and managed by general internists, family practitioners, or other primary health care providers. The high prevalence and clinical impact of certain endocrine diseases justifies vigilance for features of these disorders during routine physical examinations; laboratory screening is indicated in selected high-risk populations.

Chapter 339. Disorders of the Anterior Pituitary and Hypothalamus >
 

Disorders of the Anterior Pituitary and Hypothalamus: Introduction

The anterior pituitary often is referred to as the "master gland" because, together with the hypothalamus, it orchestrates the complex regulatory functions of many other endocrine glands. The anterior pituitary gland produces six major hormones: (1) prolactin (PRL), (2) growth hormone (GH), (3) adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), (4) luteinizing hormone (LH), (5) follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and (6) thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (Table 339-1). Pituitary hormones are secreted in a pulsatile manner, reflecting stimulation by an array of specific hypothalamic releasing factors. Each of these pituitary hormones elicits specific responses in peripheral target tissues. The hormonal products of those peripheral glands, in turn, exert feedback control at the level of the hypothalamus and pituitary to modulate pituitary function (Fig. 339-1). Pituitary tumors cause characteristic hormone-excess syndromes. Hormone deficiency may be inherited or acquired. Fortunately, there are efficacious treatments for the various pituitary hormone-excess and -deficiency syndromes. Nonetheless, these diagnoses are often elusive; this emphasizes the importance of recognizing subtle clinical manifestations and performing the correct laboratory diagnostic tests. For discussion of disorders of the posterior pituitary, or neurohypophysis, see Chap. 340.

Anatomy and Development

Anatomy

The pituitary gland weighs 600 mg and is located within the sella turcica ventral to the diaphragma sella; it consists of anatomically and functionally distinct anterior and posterior lobes. The bony sella is contiguous to vascular and neurologic structures, including the cavernous sinuses, cranial nerves, and optic chiasm. Thus, expanding intrasellar pathologic processes may have significant central mass effects in addition to their endocrinologic impact.

Figure 339-1

 
 
 
Diagram of pituitary axes. Hypothalamic hormones regulate anterior pituitary trophic hormones that in turn determine target gland secretion. Peripheral hormones feed back to regulate hypothalamic and pituitary hormones. For abbreviations, see text.
 
 


Hypothalamic neural cells synthesize specific releasing and inhibiting hormones that are secreted directly into the portal vessels of the pituitary stalk. Blood supply of the pituitary gland comes from the superior and inferior hypophyseal arteries (Fig. 339-2). The hypothalamic-pituitary portal plexus provides the major blood source for the anterior pituitary, allowing reliable transmission of hypothalamic peptide pulses without significant systemic dilution; consequently, pituitary cells are exposed to releasing or inhibiting factors and in turn release their hormones as discrete pulses (Fig. 339-3).

Figure 339-2

 
 
 
Diagram of hypothalamic-pituitary vasculature. The hypothalamic nuclei produce hormones that traverse the portal system and impinge on anterior pituitary cells to regulate pituitary hormone secretion. Posterior pituitary hormones are derived from direct neural extensions.
 
 

Figure 339-3

 
 
 
Hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulses induce secretory pulses of luteinizing hormone (LH).
 
 

The posterior pituitary is supplied by the inferior hypophyseal arteries. In contrast to the anterior pituitary, the posterior lobe is directly innervated by hypothalamic neurons (supraopticohypophyseal and tuberohypophyseal nerve tracts) via the pituitary stalk (Chap. 340). Thus, posterior pituitary production of vasopressin [antidiuretic hormone (ADH)] and oxytocin is particularly sensitive to neuronal damage by lesions that affect the pituitary stalk or hypothalamus.

Pituitary Development

The embryonic differentiation and maturation of anterior pituitary cells have been elucidated in considerable detail. Pituitary development from Rathke's pouch involves a complex interplay of lineage-specific transcription factors expressed in pluripotent precursor cells and gradients of locally produced growth factors (Table 339-1). The transcription factor Prop-1 induces pituitary development of Pit-1-specific lineages as well as gonadotropes. The transcription factor Pit-1 determines cell-specific expression of GH, PRL, and TSH in somatotropes, lactotropes, and thyrotropes. Expression of high levels of estrogen receptors in cells that contain Pit-1 favors PRL expression, whereas thyrotrope embryonic factor (TEF) induces TSH expression. Pit-1 binds to GH, PRL, and TSH gene regulatory elements as well as to recognition sites on its own promoter, providing a mechanism for maintaining specific pituitary phenotypic stability. Gonadotrope cell development is further defined by the cell-specific expression of the nuclear receptors steroidogenic factor (SF-1) and dosage-sensitive sex reversal, adrenal hypoplasia critical region, on chromosome X, gene 1 (DAX-1). Development of corticotrope cells, which express the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene, requires the T-Pit transcription factor. Abnormalities of pituitary development caused by mutations of Pit-1, Prop-1, SF-1, DAX-1, and T-Pit result in a series of rare, selective or combined pituitary hormone deficits.
 
Hypothalamic and Anterior Pituitary Insufficiency

Hypopituitarism results from impaired production of one or more of the anterior pituitary trophic hormones. Reduced pituitary function can result from inherited disorders; more commonly, hypopituitarism is acquired and reflects the compressive mass effects of tumors or the consequences of inflammation or vascular damage. These processes also may impair synthesis or secretion of hypothalamic hormones, with resultant pituitary failure (Table 339-2).

*Trophic hormone failure associated with pituitary compression or destruction usually occurs sequentially: GH > FSH > LH > TSH > ACTH. During childhood, growth retardation is often the presenting feature, and in adults, hypogonadism is the earliest symptom.
 

Developmental and Genetic Causes of Hypopituitarism

Pituitary Dysplasia

Pituitary dysplasia may result in aplastic, hypoplastic, or ectopic pituitary gland development. Because pituitary development follows midline cell migration from the nasopharyngeal Rathke's pouch, midline craniofacial disorders may be associated with pituitary dysplasia. Acquired pituitary failure in the newborn also can be caused by birth trauma, including cranial hemorrhage, asphyxia, and breech delivery.

Septo-Optic Dysplasia

Hypothalamic dysfunction and hypopituitarism may result from dysgenesis of the septum pellucidum or corpus callosum. Affected children have mutations in the HESX1 gene, which is involved in early development of the ventral prosencephalon. These children exhibit variable combinations of cleft palate, syndactyly, ear deformities, hypertelorism, optic atrophy, micropenis, and anosmia. Pituitary dysfunction leads to diabetes insipidus, GH deficiency and short stature, and, occasionally, TSH deficiency.

Tissue-Specific Factor Mutations

Several pituitary cell每specific transcription factors, such as Pit-1 and Prop-1, are critical for determining the development and committed function of differentiated anterior pituitary cell lineages. Autosomal dominant or recessive Pit-1 mutations cause combined GH, PRL, and TSH deficiencies. These patients usually present with growth failure and varying degrees of hypothyroidism. The pituitary may appear hypoplastic on MRI.

Prop-1 is expressed early in pituitary development and appears to be required for Pit-1 function. Familial and sporadic PROP1 mutations result in combined GH, PRL, TSH, and gonadotropin deficiency. Over 80% of these patients have growth retardation; by adulthood, all are deficient in TSH and gonadotropins, and a small minority later develop ACTH deficiency. Because of gonadotropin deficiency, these individuals do not enter puberty spontaneously. In some cases, the pituitary gland is enlarged. TPIT mutations result in ACTH deficiency associated with hypocortisolism.

Kallmann syndrome results from defective hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) synthesis and is associated with anosmia or hyposmia due to olfactory bulb agenesis or hypoplasia (Chap. 346). The syndrome also may be associated with color blindness, optic atrophy, nerve deafness, cleft palate, renal abnormalities, cryptorchidism, and neurologic abnormalities such as mirror movements. Defects in the X-linked KAL gene impair embryonic migration of GnRH neurons from the hypothalamic olfactory placode to the hypothalamus. Genetic abnormalities, in addition to KAL mutations, also can cause isolated GnRH deficiency. Autosomal recessive (i.e., GPR54, KISS1) and dominant (i.e., FGFR1) modes of transmission have been described, and there is a growing list of genes associated with GnRH deficiency (GNRH1, PROK2, PROKR2, CH7, PCSK1, FGF8, TAC3, TACR3). GnRH deficiency prevents progression through puberty. Males present with delayed puberty and pronounced hypogonadal features, including micropenis, probably the result of low testosterone levels during infancy. Females present with primary amenorrhea and failure of secondary sexual development.

Kallmann syndrome and other causes of congenital GnRH deficiency are characterized by low LH and FSH levels and low concentrations of sex steroids (testosterone or estradiol). In sporadic cases of isolated gonadotropin deficiency, the diagnosis is often one of exclusion after other causes of hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction have been eliminated. Repetitive GnRH administration restores normal pituitary gonadotropin responses, pointing to a hypothalamic defect.

Long-term treatment of men with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or testosterone restores pubertal development and secondary sex characteristics; women can be treated with cyclic estrogen and progestin. Fertility also may be restored by the administration of gonadotropins or by using a portable infusion pump to deliver subcutaneous, pulsatile GnRH.

Bardet-Biedl Syndrome

This is a rare genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by mental retardation, renal abnormalities, obesity, and hexadactyly, brachydactyly, or syndactyly. Central diabetes insipidus may or may not be associated. GnRH deficiency occurs in 75% of males and half of affected females. Retinal degeneration begins in early childhood, and most patients are blind by age 30. Numerous subtypes of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) have been identified, with genetic linkage to at least nine different loci. Several of the loci encode genes involved in basal body cilia function, and this may account for the diverse clinical manifestations.

Leptin and Leptin Receptor Mutations

Deficiencies of leptin or its receptor cause a broad spectrum of hypothalamic abnormalities, including hyperphagia, obesity, and central hypogonadism (Chap. 77). Decreased GnRH production in these patients results in attenuated pituitary FSH and LH synthesis and release.

Prader-Willi Syndrome

This is a contiguous gene syndrome that results from deletion of the paternal copies of the imprinted SNRPN gene, the NECDIN gene, and possibly other genes on chromosome 15q. Prader-Willi syndrome is associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, hyperphagia-obesity, chronic muscle hypotonia, mental retardation, and adult-onset diabetes mellitus (Chap. 62). Multiple somatic defects also involve the skull, eyes, ears, hands, and feet. Diminished hypothalamic oxytocin- and vasopressin-producing nuclei have been reported. Deficient GnRH synthesis is suggested by the observation that chronic GnRH treatment restores pituitary LH and FSH release.

Acquired Hypopituitarism

Hypopituitarism may be caused by accidental or neurosurgical trauma; vascular events such as apoplexy; pituitary or hypothalamic neoplasms, craniopharyngioma, lymphoma, or metastatic tumors; inflammatory disease such as lymphocytic hypophysitis; infiltrative disorders such as sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis (Chap. 357), and tuberculosis; or irradiation.

Increasing evidence suggests that patients with brain injury, including sports trauma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and irradiation, have transient hypopituitarism and require intermittent long-term endocrine follow-up, as permanent hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction will develop in 25每40% of these patients.

Hypothalamic Infiltration Disorders

These disorders〞including sarcoidosis, histiocytosis X, amyloidosis, and hemochromatosis〞frequently involve both hypothalamic and pituitary neuronal and neurochemical tracts. Consequently, diabetes insipidus occurs in half of patients with these disorders. Growth retardation is seen if attenuated GH secretion occurs before pubertal epiphyseal closure. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and hyperprolactinemia are also common.

Inflammatory Lesions

Pituitary damage and subsequent dysfunction can be seen with chronic infections such as tuberculosis, with opportunistic fungal infections associated with AIDS, and in tertiary syphilis. Other inflammatory processes, such as granulomas and sarcoidosis, may mimic the features of a pituitary adenoma. These lesions may cause extensive hypothalamic and pituitary damage, leading to trophic hormone deficiencies.

Cranial Irradiation

Cranial irradiation may result in long-term hypothalamic and pituitary dysfunction, especially in children and adolescents, as they are more susceptible to damage after whole-brain or head and neck therapeutic irradiation. The development of hormonal abnormalities correlates strongly with irradiation dosage and the time interval after completion of radiotherapy. Up to two-thirds of patients ultimately develop hormone insufficiency after a median dose of 50 Gy (5000 rad) directed at the skull base. The development of hypopituitarism occurs over 5每15 years and usually reflects hypothalamic damage rather than primary destruction of pituitary cells. Although the pattern of hormone loss is variable, GH deficiency is most common, followed by gonadotropin and ACTH deficiency. When deficiency of one or more hormones is documented, the possibility of diminished reserve of other hormones is likely. Accordingly, anterior pituitary function should be continually evaluated over the long term in previously irradiated patients, and replacement therapy instituted when appropriate (see below).

Lymphocytic Hypophysitis

This occurs most often in postpartum women; it usually presents with hyperprolactinemia and MRI evidence of a prominent pituitary mass that often resembles an adenoma, with mildly elevated PRL levels. Pituitary failure caused by diffuse lymphocytic infiltration may be transient or permanent but requires immediate evaluation and treatment. Rarely, isolated pituitary hormone deficiencies have been described, suggesting a selective autoimmune process targeted to specific cell types. Most patients manifest symptoms of progressive mass effects with headache and visual disturbance. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate often is elevated. As the MRI image may be indistinguishable from that of a pituitary adenoma, hypophysitis should be considered in a postpartum woman with a newly diagnosed pituitary mass before an unnecessary surgical intervention is undertaken. The inflammatory process often resolves after several months of glucocorticoid treatment, and pituitary function may be restored, depending on the extent of damage.

Pituitary Apoplexy

Acute intrapituitary hemorrhagic vascular events can cause substantial damage to the pituitary and surrounding sellar structures. Pituitary apoplexy may occur spontaneously in a preexisting adenoma; postpartum (Sheehan's syndrome); or in association with diabetes, hypertension, sickle cell anemia, or acute shock. The hyperplastic enlargement of the pituitary, which occurs normally during pregnancy, increases the risk for hemorrhage and infarction. Apoplexy is an endocrine emergency that may result in severe hypoglycemia, hypotension and shock, central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage, and death. Acute symptoms may include severe headache with signs of meningeal irritation, bilateral visual changes, ophthalmoplegia, and, in severe cases, cardiovascular collapse and loss of consciousness. Pituitary CT or MRI may reveal signs of intratumoral or sellar hemorrhage, with deviation of the pituitary stalk and compression of pituitary tissue.

Patients with no evident visual loss or impaired consciousness can be observed and managed conservatively with high-dose glucocorticoids. Those with significant or progressive visual loss or loss of consciousness require urgent surgical decompression. Visual recovery after sellar surgery is inversely correlated with the length of time after the acute event. Therefore, severe ophthalmoplegia or visual deficits are indications for early surgery. Hypopituitarism is very common after apoplexy.

Empty Sella

A partial or apparently totally empty sella is often an incidental MRI finding. These patients usually have normal pituitary function, implying that the surrounding rim of pituitary tissue is fully functional. Hypopituitarism, however, may develop insidiously. Pituitary masses also may undergo clinically silent infarction and involution with development of a partial or totally empty sella by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) filling the dural herniation. Rarely, small but functional pituitary adenomas may arise within the rim of pituitary tissue, and they are not always visible on MRI.

Presentation and Diagnosis

The clinical manifestations of hypopituitarism depend on which hormones are lost and the extent of the hormone deficiency. GH deficiency causes growth disorders in children and leads to abnormal body composition in adults (see below). Gonadotropin deficiency causes menstrual disorders and infertility in women and decreased sexual function, infertility, and loss of secondary sexual characteristics in men. TSH and ACTH deficiency usually develop later in the course of pituitary failure. TSH deficiency causes growth retardation in children and features of hypothyroidism in children and adults. The secondary form of adrenal insufficiency caused by ACTH deficiency leads to hypocortisolism with relative preservation of mineralocorticoid production. PRL deficiency causes failure of lactation. When lesions involve the posterior pituitary, polyuria and polydipsia reflect loss of vasopressin secretion. Epidemiologic studies have documented an increased mortality rate in patients with long-standing pituitary damage, primarily from increased cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. Previous head or neck irradiation is also a determinant of increased mortality rates in patients with hypopituitarism.

Laboratory Investigation

Biochemical diagnosis of pituitary insufficiency is made by demonstrating low levels of trophic hormones in the setting of low levels of target hormones. For example, low free thyroxine in the setting of a low or inappropriately normal TSH level suggests secondary hypothyroidism. Similarly, a low testosterone level without elevation of gonadotropins suggests hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Provocative tests may be required to assess pituitary reserve (Table 339-3). GH responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, arginine, l-dopa, growth hormone每releasing hormone (GHRH), or growth hormone每releasing peptides (GHRPs) can be used to assess GH reserve. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) administration induces ACTH release, and administration of synthetic ACTH (cosyntropin) evokes adrenal cortisol release as an indirect indicator of pituitary ACTH reserve (Chap. 342). ACTH reserve is most reliably assessed by measuring ACTH and cortisol levels during insulin-induced hypoglycemia. However, this test should be performed cautiously in patients with suspected adrenal insufficiency because of enhanced susceptibility to hypoglycemia and hypotension. Administering insulin to induce hypoglycemia is contraindicated in patients with active coronary artery disease or seizure disorders.

Treatment: Hypopituitarism

Hormone replacement therapy, including glucocorticoids, thyroid hormone, sex steroids, growth hormone, and vasopressin, is usually safe and free of complications. Treatment regimens that mimic physiologic hormone production allow for maintenance of satisfactory clinical homeostasis. Effective dosage schedules are outlined in Table 339-4. Patients in need of glucocorticoid replacement require careful dose adjustments during stressful events such as acute illness, dental procedures, trauma, and acute hospitalization.

Hypothalamic, Pituitary, and Other Sellar Masses

Pituitary Tumors

Pituitary adenomas are the most common cause of pituitary hormone hypersecretion and hyposecretion syndromes in adults. They account for 15% of all intracranial neoplasms and have been identified with a population prevalence of 80/100,000. At autopsy, up to one-quarter of all pituitary glands harbor an unsuspected microadenoma (<10 mm diameter). Similarly, pituitary imaging detects small clinically inapparent pituitary lesions in at least 10% of individuals.

Pathogenesis

Pituitary adenomas are benign neoplasms that arise from one of the five anterior pituitary cell types. The clinical and biochemical phenotypes of pituitary adenomas depend on the cell type from which they are derived. Thus, tumors arising from lactotrope (PRL), somatotrope (GH), corticotrope (ACTH), thyrotrope (TSH), or gonadotrope (LH, FSH) cells hypersecrete their respective hormones (Table 339-5). Plurihormonal tumors that express combinations of GH, PRL, TSH, ACTH, and the glycoprotein hormone  or  subunit may be diagnosed by careful immunocytochemistry or may manifest as clinical syndromes that combine features of these hormonal hypersecretory syndromes. Morphologically, these tumors may arise from a single polysecreting cell type or include cells with mixed function within the same tumor.

*Hormone-secreting tumors are listed in decreasing order of frequency. All tumors may cause local pressure effects, including visual disturbances, cranial nerve palsy, and headache. Note: For abbreviations, see text. Source: Adapted from S Melmed, in JL Jameson (ed): Principles of Molecular Medicine, Totowa, NJ, Humana Press, 1998.
 

Hormonally active tumors are characterized by autonomous hormone secretion with diminished feedback responsiveness to physiologic inhibitory pathways. Hormone production does not always correlate with tumor size. Small hormone-secreting adenomas may cause significant clinical perturbations, whereas larger adenomas that produce less hormone may be clinically silent and remain undiagnosed (if no central compressive effects occur). About one-third of all adenomas are clinically nonfunctioning and produce no distinct clinical hypersecretory syndrome. Most of them arise from gonadotrope cells and may secrete small amounts of - and -glycoprotein hormone subunits or, very rarely, intact circulating gonadotropins. True pituitary carcinomas with documented extracranial metastases are exceedingly rare.

Almost all pituitary adenomas are monoclonal in origin, implying the acquisition of one or more somatic mutations that confer a selective growth advantage. Consistent with their clonal origin, complete surgical resection of small pituitary adenomas usually cures hormone hypersecretion. Nevertheless, hypothalamic hormones such as GHRH and CRH also enhance mitotic activity of their respective pituitary target cells in addition to their role in pituitary hormone regulation. Thus, patients who harbor rare abdominal or chest tumors that elaborate ectopic GHRH or CRH may present with somatotrope or corticotrope hyperplasia with GH or ACTH hypersecretion.

Several etiologic genetic events have been implicated in the development of pituitary tumors. The pathogenesis of sporadic forms of acromegaly has been particularly informative as a model of tumorigenesis. GHRH, after binding to its G protein每coupled somatotrope receptor, utilizes cyclic AMP (adenosine monophosphate) as a second messenger to stimulate GH secretion and somatotrope proliferation. A subset (35%) of GH-secreting pituitary tumors contain sporadic mutations in Gs (Arg 201  Cys or His; Gln 227  Arg). These mutations attenuate intrinsic GTPase activity, resulting in constitutive elevation of cyclic AMP, Pit-1 induction, and activation of cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB), thereby promoting somatotrope cell proliferation and GH secretion.

Characteristic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in various chromosomes has been documented in large or invasive macroadenomas, suggesting the presence of putative tumor suppressor genes at these loci. LOH of chromosome regions on 11q13, 13, and 9 is present in up to 20% of sporadic pituitary tumors, including GH-, PRL-, and ACTH-producing adenomas and some nonfunctioning tumors.

Compelling evidence also favors growth factor promotion of pituitary tumor proliferation. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is abundant in the pituitary and has been shown to stimulate pituitary cell mitogenesis. Other factors involved in initiation and promotion of pituitary tumors include loss of negative-feedback inhibition (as seen with primary hypothyroidism or hypogonadism) and estrogen-mediated or paracrine angiogenesis. Growth characteristics and neoplastic behavior also may be influenced by several activated oncogenes, including RAS and pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG), or inactivation of growth suppressor genes, including MEG3.

Genetic Syndromes Associated with Pituitary Tumors

Several familial syndromes are associated with pituitary tumors, and the genetic mechanisms for some of them have been unraveled (Table 339-6).

Table 339-6 Familial Pituitary Tumor Syndromes

 
 
  Gene Mutated Clinical Features 
Multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 (MEN 1) MEN1 (11q13)  Hyperparathyroidism

Schwannomas

Adrenal hyperplasia

Lentigines
 
Familial pituitary adenomas AIP (11q13.3)  Acromegaly/gigantism (15%) 
 

 

Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 1 is an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized primarily by a genetic predisposition to parathyroid, pancreatic islet, and pituitary adenomas (Chap. 351). MEN1 is caused by inactivating germ-line mutations in MENIN, a constitutively expressed tumor-suppressor gene located on chromosome 11q13. Loss of heterozygosity, or a somatic mutation of the remaining normal MENIN allele, leads to tumorigenesis. About half of affected patients develop prolactinomas; acromegaly and Cushing's syndrome are less commonly encountered.

Carney syndrome is characterized by spotty skin pigmentation, myxomas, and endocrine tumors, including testicular, adrenal, and pituitary adenomas. Acromegaly occurs in about 20% of these patients. A subset of patients have mutations in the R1 regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PRKAR1A).

McCune-Albright syndrome consists of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, pigmented skin patches, and a variety of endocrine disorders, including acromegaly, adrenal adenomas, and autonomous ovarian function (Chap. 347). Hormonal hypersecretion results from constitutive cyclic AMP production caused by inactivation of the GTPase activity of Gs. The Gs mutations occur postzygotically, leading to a mosaic pattern of mutant expression.

Familial acromegaly is a rare disorder in which family members may manifest either acromegaly or gigantism. The disorder is associated with LOH at a chromosome 11q13 locus distinct from that of MENIN. A subset of families with a predisposition for familial pituitary tumors, especially acromegaly, have been found to harbor inactivating mutations in the AIP gene, which encodes the aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein.

Other Sellar Masses

Craniopharyngiomas are benign, suprasellar cystic masses that present with headaches, visual field deficits, and variable degrees of hypopituitarism. They are derived from Rathke's pouch and arise near the pituitary stalk, commonly extending into the suprasellar cistern. Craniopharyngiomas are often large, cystic, and locally invasive. Many are partially calcified, exhibiting a characteristic appearance on skull x-ray and CT images. More than half of all patients present before age 20, usually with signs of increased intracranial pressure, including headache, vomiting, papilledema, and hydrocephalus. Associated symptoms include visual field abnormalities, personality changes and cognitive deterioration, cranial nerve damage, sleep difficulties, and weight gain. Hypopituitarism can be documented in about 90%, and diabetes insipidus occurs in about 10% of patients. About half of affected children present with growth retardation. MRI is generally superior to CT for evaluating cystic structure and tissue components of craniopharyngiomas. CT is useful to define calcifications and evaluate invasion into surrounding bony structures and sinuses.

Treatment usually involves transcranial or transsphenoidal surgical resection followed by postoperative radiation of residual tumor. Surgery alone is curative in less than half of patients because of recurrences due to adherence to vital structures or because of small tumor deposits in the hypothalamus or brain parenchyma. The goal of surgery is to remove as much tumor as possible without risking complications associated with efforts to remove firmly adherent or inaccessible tissue. In the absence of radiotherapy, about 75% of craniopharyngiomas recur, and 10-year survival is less than 50%. In patients with incomplete resection, radiotherapy improves 10-year survival to 70每90% but is associated with increased risk of secondary malignancies. Most patients require lifelong pituitary hormone replacement.

Developmental failure of Rathke's pouch obliteration may lead to Rathke's cysts, which are small (<5 mm) cysts entrapped by squamous epithelium and are found in about 20% of individuals at autopsy. Although Rathke's cleft cysts do not usually grow and are often diagnosed incidentally, about a third present in adulthood with compressive symptoms, diabetes insipidus, and hyperprolactinemia due to stalk compression. Rarely, hydrocephalus develops. The diagnosis is suggested preoperatively by visualizing the cyst wall on MRI, which distinguishes these lesions from craniopharyngiomas. Cyst contents range from CSF-like fluid to mucoid material. Arachnoid cysts are rare and generate an MRI image that is isointense with cerebrospinal fluid.

Sella chordomas usually present with bony clival erosion, local invasiveness, and, on occasion, calcification. Normal pituitary tissue may be visible on MRI, distinguishing chordomas from aggressive pituitary adenomas. Mucinous material may be obtained by fine-needle aspiration.

Meningiomas arising in the sellar region may be difficult to distinguish from nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. Meningiomas typically enhance on MRI and may show evidence of calcification or bony erosion. Meningiomas may cause compressive symptoms.

Histiocytosis X includes a variety of syndromes associated with foci of eosinophilic granulomas. Diabetes insipidus, exophthalmos, and punched-out lytic bone lesions (Hand-Sch邦ller-Christian disease) are associated with granulomatous lesions visible on MRI, as well as a characteristic axillary skin rash. Rarely, the pituitary stalk may be involved.

Pituitary metastases occur in 3% of cancer patients. Bloodborne metastatic deposits are found almost exclusively in the posterior pituitary. Accordingly, diabetes insipidus can be a presenting feature of lung, gastrointestinal, breast, and other pituitary metastases. About half of pituitary metastases originate from breast cancer; about 25% of patients with metastatic breast cancer have such deposits. Rarely, pituitary stalk involvement results in anterior pituitary insufficiency. The MRI diagnosis of a metastatic lesion may be difficult to distinguish from an aggressive pituitary adenoma; the diagnosis may require histologic examination of excised tumor tissue. Primary or metastatic lymphoma, leukemias, and plasmacytomas also occur within the sella.

Hypothalamic hamartomas and gangliocytomas may arise from astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons with varying degrees of differentiation. These tumors may overexpress hypothalamic neuropeptides, including GnRH, GHRH, and CRH. With GnRH-producing tumors, children present with precocious puberty, psychomotor delay, and laughing-associated seizures. Medical treatment of GnRH-producing hamartomas with long-acting GnRH analogues effectively suppresses gonadotropin secretion and controls premature pubertal development. Rarely, hamartomas also are associated with craniofacial abnormalities; imperforate anus; cardiac, renal, and lung disorders; and pituitary failure as features of Pallister-Hall syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the carboxy terminus of the GLI3 gene. Hypothalamic hamartomas are often contiguous with the pituitary, and preoperative MRI diagnosis may not be possible. Histologic evidence of hypothalamic neurons in tissue resected at transsphenoidal surgery may be the first indication of a primary hypothalamic lesion.

Hypothalamic gliomas and optic gliomas occur mainly in childhood and usually present with visual loss. Adults have more aggressive tumors; about a third are associated with neurofibromatosis.

Brain germ-cell tumors may arise within the sellar region. They include dysgerminomas, which frequently are associated with diabetes insipidus and visual loss. They rarely metastasize. Germinomas, embryonal carcinomas, teratomas, and choriocarcinomas may arise in the parasellar region and produce hCG. These germ-cell tumors present with precocious puberty, diabetes insipidus, visual field defects, and thirst disorders. Many patients are GH-deficient with short stature.

Metabolic Effects of Hypothalamic Lesions

Lesions involving the anterior and preoptic hypothalamic regions cause paradoxical vasoconstriction, tachycardia, and hyperthermia. Acute hyperthermia usually is due to a hemorrhagic insult, but poikilothermia may also occur. Central disorders of thermoregulation result from posterior hypothalamic damage. The periodic hypothermia syndrome is characterized by episodic attacks of rectal temperatures <30∼C (86∼F), sweating, vasodilation, vomiting, and bradycardia (Chap. 19). Damage to the ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei by craniopharyngiomas, hypothalamic trauma, or inflammatory disorders may be associated with hyperphagia and obesity. This region appears to contain an energy-satiety center where melanocortin receptors are influenced by leptin, insulin, POMC products, and gastrointestinal peptides (Chap. 77). Polydipsia and hypodipsia are associated with damage to central osmoreceptors located in preoptic nuclei (Chap. 340). Slow-growing hypothalamic lesions can cause increased somnolence and disturbed sleep cycles as well as obesity, hypothermia, and emotional outbursts. Lesions of the central hypothalamus may stimulate sympathetic neurons, leading to elevated serum catecholamine and cortisol levels. These patients are predisposed to cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, and gastric erosions.

Evaluation

Local Mass Effects

Clinical manifestations of sellar lesions vary, depending on the anatomic location of the mass and the direction of its extension (Table 339-7). The dorsal sellar diaphragm presents the least resistance to soft tissue expansion from the sella; consequently, pituitary adenomas frequently extend in a suprasellar direction. Bony invasion may occur as well.

*As the intrasellar mass expands, it first compresses intrasellar pituitary tissue, then usually invades dorsally through the dura to lift the optic chiasm or laterally to the cavernous sinuses. Bony erosion is rare, as is direct brain compression. Microadenomas may present with headache.
 

Headaches are common features of small intrasellar tumors, even with no demonstrable suprasellar extension. Because of the confined nature of the pituitary, small changes in intrasellar pressure stretch the dural plate; however, headache severity correlates poorly with adenoma size or extension.

Suprasellar extension can lead to visual loss by several mechanisms, the most common being compression of the optic chiasm, but rarely, direct invasion of the optic nerves or obstruction of CSF flow leading to secondary visual disturbances also occurs. Pituitary stalk compression by a hormonally active or inactive intrasellar mass may compress the portal vessels, disrupting pituitary access to hypothalamic hormones and dopamine; this results in early hyperprolactinemia and later concurrent loss of other pituitary hormones. This "stalk section" phenomenon may also be caused by trauma, whiplash injury with posterior clinoid stalk compression, or skull base fractures. Lateral mass invasion may impinge on the cavernous sinus and compress its neural contents, leading to cranial nerve III, IV, and VI palsies as well as effects on the ophthalmic and maxillary branches of the fifth cranial nerve (Chap. 376). Patients may present with diplopia, ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and decreased facial sensation, depending on the extent of neural damage. Extension into the sphenoid sinus indicates that the pituitary mass has eroded through the sellar floor. Aggressive tumors rarely invade the palate roof and cause nasopharyngeal obstruction, infection, and CSF leakage. Temporal and frontal lobe involvement may rarely lead to uncinate seizures, personality disorders, and anosmia. Direct hypothalamic encroachment by an invasive pituitary mass may cause important metabolic sequelae, including precocious puberty or hypogonadism, diabetes insipidus, sleep disturbances, dysthermia, and appetite disorders.

MRI

Sagittal and coronal T1-weighted MRI imaging before and after administration of gadolinium allows precise visualization of the pituitary gland with clear delineation of the hypothalamus, pituitary stalk, pituitary tissue and surrounding suprasellar cisterns, cavernous sinuses, sphenoid sinus, and optic chiasm. Pituitary gland height ranges from 6 mm in children to 8 mm in adults; during pregnancy and puberty, the height may reach 10每12 mm. The upper aspect of the adult pituitary is flat or slightly concave, but in adolescent and pregnant individuals, this surface may be convex, reflecting physiologic pituitary enlargement. The stalk should be midline and vertical. CT scan is reserved to define the extent of bony erosion or the presence of calcification.

Anterior pituitary gland soft tissue consistency is slightly heterogeneous on MRI, and signal intensity resembles that of brain matter on T1-weighted imaging (Fig. 339-4). Adenoma density is usually lower than that of surrounding normal tissue on T1-weighted imaging, and the signal intensity increases with T2-weighted images. The high phospholipid content of the posterior pituitary results in a "pituitary bright spot."

Sellar masses are encountered commonly as incidental findings on MRI, and most of them are pituitary adenomas (incidentalomas). In the absence of hormone hypersecretion, these small intrasellar lesions can be monitored safely with MRI, which is performed annually and then less often if there is no evidence of further growth. Resection should be considered for incidentally discovered macroadenomas, as about one-third become invasive or cause local pressure effects. If hormone hypersecretion is evident, specific therapies are indicated. When larger masses (>1 cm) are encountered, they should also be distinguished from nonadenomatous lesions. Meningiomas often are associated with bony hyperostosis; craniopharyngiomas may be calcified and are usually hypodense, whereas gliomas are hyperdense on T2-weighted images.

Ophthalmologic Evaluation

Because optic tracts may be contiguous to an expanding pituitary mass, reproducible visual field assessment using perimetry techniques should be performed on all patients with sellar mass lesions that abut the optic chiasm (Chap. 28). Bitemporal hemianopia or superior bitemporal defects are classically observed, reflecting the location of these tracts within the inferior and posterior part of the chiasm. Homonymous cuts reflect postchiasmal lesions, and monocular field cuts prechiasmal lesions. Loss of red perception is an early sign of optic tract pressure. Early diagnosis reduces the risk of blindness, scotomas, or other visual disturbances.

Laboratory Investigation

The presenting clinical features of functional pituitary adenomas (e.g., acromegaly, prolactinomas, or Cushing's syndrome) should guide the laboratory studies (Table 339-8). However, for a sellar mass with no obvious clinical features of hormone excess, laboratory studies are geared toward determining the nature of the tumor and assessing the possible presence of hypopituitarism. When a pituitary adenoma is suspected based on MRI, initial hormonal evaluation usually includes (1) basal PRL; (2) insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I; (3) 24-h urinary free cortisol (UFC) and/or overnight oral dexamethasone (1 mg) suppression test; (4)  subunit, FSH, and LH; and (5) thyroid function tests. Additional hormonal evaluation may be indicated based on the results of these tests. Pending more detailed assessment of hypopituitarism, a menstrual history, measurement of testosterone and 8 A.M. cortisol levels, and thyroid function tests usually identify patients with pituitary hormone deficiencies that require hormone replacement before further testing or surgery.

Histologic Evaluation

Immunohistochemical staining of pituitary tumor specimens obtained at transsphenoidal surgery confirms clinical and laboratory studies and provides a histologic diagnosis when hormone studies are equivocal and in cases of clinically nonfunctioning tumors. Occasionally, ultrastructural assessment by electron microscopy is required for diagnosis.

Treatment: Hypothalamic, Pituitary, and Other Sellar Masses


Overview

Successful management of sellar masses requires accurate diagnosis as well as selection of optimal therapeutic modalities. Most pituitary tumors are benign and slow-growing. Clinical features result from local mass effects and hormonal hypo- or hypersecretion syndromes caused directly by the adenoma or occurring as a consequence of treatment. Thus, lifelong management and follow-up are necessary for these patients.

MRI with gadolinium enhancement for pituitary visualization, new advances in transsphenoidal surgery and in stereotactic radiotherapy (including gamma-knife radiotherapy), and novel therapeutic agents have improved pituitary tumor management. The goals of pituitary tumor treatment include normalization of excess pituitary secretion, amelioration of symptoms and signs of hormonal hypersecretion syndromes, and shrinkage or ablation of large tumor masses with relief of adjacent structure compression. Residual anterior pituitary function should be preserved during treatment and sometimes can be restored by removing the tumor mass. Ideally, adenoma recurrence should be prevented.

Transsphenoidal Surgery

Transsphenoidal rather than transfrontal resection is the desired surgical approach for pituitary tumors, except for the rare invasive suprasellar mass surrounding the frontal or middle fossa or the optic nerves or invading posteriorly behind the clivus. Intraoperative microscopy facilitates visual distinction between adenomatous and normal pituitary tissue as well as microdissection of small tumors that may not be visible by MRI (Fig. 339-5). Transsphenoidal surgery also avoids the cranial invasion and manipulation of brain tissue required by subfrontal surgical approaches. Endoscopic techniques with three-dimensional intraoperative localization have also improved visualization and access to tumor tissue.

Figure 339-5

In addition to correction of hormonal hypersecretion, pituitary surgery is indicated for mass lesions that impinge on surrounding structures. Surgical decompression and resection are required for an expanding pituitary mass accompanied by persistent headache, progressive visual field defects, cranial nerve palsies, hydrocephalus, and, occasionally, intrapituitary hemorrhage and apoplexy. Transsphenoidal surgery sometimes is used for pituitary tissue biopsy to establish a histologic diagnosis.

Whenever possible, the pituitary mass lesion should be selectively excised; normal pituitary tissue should be manipulated or resected only when critical for effective mass dissection. Nonselective hemihypophysectomy or total hypophysectomy may be indicated if no hypersecreting mass lesion is clearly discernible, multifocal lesions are present, or the remaining nontumorous pituitary tissue is obviously necrotic. This strategy, however, increases the likelihood of hypopituitarism and the need for lifelong hormone replacement.

Preoperative mass effects, including visual field defects and compromised pituitary function, may be reversed by surgery, particularly when the deficits are not long-standing. For large and invasive tumors, it is necessary to determine the optimal balance between maximal tumor resection and preservation of anterior pituitary function, especially for preserving growth and reproductive function in younger patients. Similarly, tumor invasion outside the sella is rarely amenable to surgical cure; the surgeon must judge the risk-versus-benefit ratio of extensive tumor resection.

Side Effects

Tumor size, the degree of invasiveness, and experience of the surgeon largely determine the incidence of surgical complications. Operative mortality rate is about 1%. Transient diabetes insipidus and hypopituitarism occur in up to 20% of patients. Permanent diabetes insipidus, cranial nerve damage, nasal septal perforation, or visual disturbances may be encountered in up to 10% of patients. CSF leaks occur in 4% of patients. Less common complications include carotid artery injury, loss of vision, hypothalamic damage, and meningitis. Permanent side effects are rare after surgery for microadenomas.

Radiation

Radiation is used either as a primary therapy for pituitary or parasellar masses or, more commonly, as an adjunct to surgery or medical therapy. Focused megavoltage irradiation is achieved by precise MRI localization, using a high-voltage linear accelerator and accurate isocentric rotational arcing. A major determinant of accurate irradiation is reproduction of the patient's head position during multiple visits and maintenance of absolute head immobility. A total of <50 Gy (5000 rad) is given as 180-cGy (180-rad) fractions divided over about 6 weeks. Stereotactic radiosurgery delivers a large single high-energy dose from a cobalt 60 source (gamma knife), linear accelerator, or cyclotron. Long-term effects of gamma-knife surgery are unclear but appear to be similar to those encountered with conventional radiation.

The role of radiation therapy in pituitary tumor management depends on multiple factors, including the nature of the tumor, the age of the patient, and the availability of surgical and radiation expertise. Because of its relatively slow onset of action, radiation therapy is usually reserved for postsurgical management. As an adjuvant to surgery, radiation is used to treat residual tumor and in an attempt to prevent regrowth. Irradiation offers the only means for potentially ablating significant postoperative residual nonfunctioning tumor tissue. In contrast, PRL- and GH-secreting tumor tissues are amenable to medical therapy.

Side Effects

In the short term, radiation may cause transient nausea and weakness. Alopecia and loss of taste and smell may be more long-lasting. Failure of pituitary hormone synthesis is common in patients who have undergone head and neck or pituitary-directed irradiation. More than 50% of patients develop loss of GH, ACTH, TSH, and/or gonadotropin secretion within 10 years, usually due to hypothalamic damage. Lifelong follow-up with testing of anterior pituitary hormone reserve is therefore required after radiation treatment. Optic nerve damage with impaired vision due to optic neuritis is reported in about 2% of patients who undergo pituitary irradiation. Cranial nerve damage is uncommon now that radiation doses are 2 Gy (200 rad) at any one treatment session and the maximum dose is <50 Gy (5000 rad). The use of stereotactic radiotherapy may reduce damage to adjacent structures. Radiotherapy for pituitary tumors has been associated with adverse mortality rates, mainly from cerebrovascular disease. The cumulative risk of developing a secondary tumor after conventional radiation is 1.3% after 10 years and 1.9% after 20 years.

Medical

Medical therapy for pituitary tumors is highly specific and depends on tumor type. For prolactinomas, dopamine agonists are the treatment of choice. For acromegaly, somatostatin analogues and GH receptor antagonists are indicated. For TSH-secreting tumors, somatostatin analogues and occasionally dopamine agonists are indicated. ACTH-secreting tumors and nonfunctioning tumors are generally not responsive to medications and require surgery and/or irradiation.
 
Prolactin

Synthesis

PRL consists of 198 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 21,500 kDa; it is weakly homologous to GH and human placental lactogen (hPL), reflecting the duplication and divergence of a common GH-PRL-hPL precursor gene. PRL is synthesized in lactotropes, which constitute about 20% of anterior pituitary cells. Lactotropes and somatotropes are derived from a common precursor cell that may give rise to a tumor that secretes both PRL and GH. Marked lactotrope cell hyperplasia develops during pregnancy and the first few months of lactation. These transient functional changes in the lactotrope population are induced by estrogen.

Secretion

Normal adult serum PRL levels are about 10每25 g/L in women and 10每20 g/L in men. PRL secretion is pulsatile, with the highest secretory peaks occurring during rapid eye movement sleep. Peak serum PRL levels (up to 30 g/L) occur between 4:00 and 6:00 a.m. The circulating half-life of PRL is about 50 min.

PRL is unique among the pituitary hormones in that the predominant central control mechanism is inhibitory, reflecting dopamine-mediated suppression of PRL release. This regulatory pathway accounts for the spontaneous PRL hypersecretion that occurs with pituitary stalk section, often a consequence of compressive mass lesions at the skull base. Pituitary dopamine type 2 (D2) receptors mediate inhibition of PRL synthesis and secretion. Targeted disruption (gene knockout) of the murine D2 receptor in mice results in hyperprolactinemia and lactotrope proliferation. As discussed below, dopamine agonists play a central role in the management of hyperprolactinemic disorders.

Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) (pyro Glu-His-Pro-NH2) is a hypothalamic tripeptide that elicits prolactin release within 15每30 min after intravenous injection. The physiologic relevance of TRH for PRL regulation is unclear, and it appears primarily to regulate TSH (Chap. 341). Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) also induces PRL release, whereas glucocorticoids and thyroid hormone weakly suppress PRL secretion.

Serum PRL levels rise transiently after exercise, meals, sexual intercourse, minor surgical procedures, general anesthesia, chest wall injury, acute myocardial infarction, and other forms of acute stress. PRL levels increase markedly (about tenfold) during pregnancy and decline rapidly within 2 weeks of parturition. If breast-feeding is initiated, basal PRL levels remain elevated; suckling stimulates reflex increases in PRL levels that last for about 30每45 min. Breast suckling activates neural afferent pathways in the hypothalamus that induce PRL release. With time, suckling-induced responses diminish and interfeeding PRL levels return to normal.

Action

The PRL receptor is a member of the type I cytokine receptor family that also includes GH and interleukin (IL) 6 receptors. Ligand binding induces receptor dimerization and intracellular signaling by Janus kinase (JAK), which stimulates translocation of the signal transduction and activators of transcription (STAT) family to activate target genes. In the breast, the lobuloalveolar epithelium proliferates in response to PRL, placental lactogens, estrogen, progesterone, and local paracrine growth factors, including IGF-I.

PRL acts to induce and maintain lactation, decrease reproductive function, and suppress sexual drive. These functions are geared toward ensuring that maternal lactation is sustained and not interrupted by pregnancy. PRL inhibits reproductive function by suppressing hypothalamic GnRH and pituitary gonadotropin secretion and by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both women and men. In the ovary, PRL blocks folliculogenesis and inhibits granulosa cell aromatase activity, leading to hypoestrogenism and anovulation. PRL also has a luteolytic effect, generating a shortened, or inadequate, luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. In men, attenuated LH secretion leads to low testosterone levels and decreased spermatogenesis. These hormonal changes decrease libido and reduce fertility in patients with hyperprolactinemia.

Hyperprolactinemia

Etiology

Hyperprolactinemia is the most common pituitary hormone hypersecretion syndrome in both men and women. PRL-secreting pituitary adenomas (prolactinomas) are the most common cause of PRL levels >200 g/L (see below). Less pronounced PRL elevation can also be seen with microprolactinomas but is more commonly caused by drugs, pituitary stalk compression, hypothyroidism, or renal failure (Table 339-9).

Pregnancy and lactation are the important physiologic causes of hyperprolactinemia. Sleep-associated hyperprolactinemia reverts to normal within an hour of awakening. Nipple stimulation and sexual orgasm also may increase PRL. Chest wall stimulation or trauma (including chest surgery and herpes zoster) invoke the reflex suckling arc with resultant hyperprolactinemia. Chronic renal failure elevates PRL by decreasing peripheral clearance. Primary hypothyroidism is associated with mild hyperprolactinemia, probably because of compensatory TRH secretion.

Lesions of the hypothalamic-pituitary region that disrupt hypothalamic dopamine synthesis, portal vessel delivery, or lactotrope responses are associated with hyperprolactinemia. Thus, hypothalamic tumors, cysts, infiltrative disorders, and radiation-induced damage cause elevated PRL levels, usually in the range of 30每100 g/L. Plurihormonal adenomas (including GH and ACTH tumors) may hypersecrete PRL directly. Pituitary masses, including clinically nonfunctioning pituitary tumors, may compress the pituitary stalk to cause hyperprolactinemia.

Drug-induced inhibition or disruption of dopaminergic receptor function is a common cause of hyperprolactinemia (Table 339-9). Thus, antipsychotics and antidepressants are a relatively common cause of mild hyperprolactinemia. Most patients receiving risperidone have elevated prolactin levels, sometimes exceeding 200 ug/L. Methyldopa inhibits dopamine synthesis and verapamil blocks dopamine release, also leading to hyperprolactinemia. Hormonal agents that induce PRL include estrogens and TRH.

Presentation and Diagnosis

Amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and infertility are the hallmarks of hyperprolactinemia in women. If hyperprolactinemia develops before menarche, primary amenorrhea results. More commonly, hyperprolactinemia develops later in life and leads to oligomenorrhea and ultimately to amenorrhea. If hyperprolactinemia is sustained, vertebral bone mineral density can be reduced compared with age-matched controls, particularly when it is associated with pronounced hypoestrogenemia. Galactorrhea is present in up to 80% of hyperprolactinemic women. Although usually bilateral and spontaneous, it may be unilateral or expressed only manually. Patients also may complain of decreased libido, weight gain, and mild hirsutism.

In men with hyperprolactinemia, diminished libido, infertility, and visual loss (from optic nerve compression) are the usual presenting symptoms. Gonadotropin suppression leads to reduced testosterone, impotence, and oligospermia. True galactorrhea is uncommon in men with hyperprolactinemia. If the disorder is long-standing, secondary effects of hypogonadism are evident, including osteopenia, reduced muscle mass, and decreased beard growth.

The diagnosis of idiopathichyperprolactinemia is made by exclusion of known causes of hyperprolactinemia in the setting of a normal pituitary MRI. Some of these patients may harbor small microadenomas below visible MRI sensitivity (2 mm).

Galactorrhea

Galactorrhea, the inappropriate discharge of milk-containing fluid from the breast, is considered abnormal if it persists longer than 6 months after childbirth or discontinuation of breast-feeding. Postpartum galactorrhea associated with amenorrhea is a self-limiting disorder usually associated with moderately elevated PRL levels. Galactorrhea may occur spontaneously, or it may be elicited by nipple pressure. In both men and women, galactorrhea may vary in color and consistency (transparent, milky, or bloody) and arise either unilaterally or bilaterally. Mammography or ultrasound is indicated for bloody discharges (particularly from a single nipple), which may be caused by breast cancer. Galactorrhea is commonly associated with hyperprolactinemia caused by any of the conditions listed in Table 339-9. Acromegaly is associated with galactorrhea in about one-third of patients. Treatment of galactorrhea usually involves managing the underlying disorder (e.g., replacing T4 for hypothyroidism, discontinuing a medication, treating prolactinoma).

Laboratory Investigation

Basal, fasting morning PRL levels (normally <20 g/L) should be measured to assess hypersecretion. Both false-positive and false-negative results may be encountered. In patients with markedly elevated PRL levels (>1000 g/L), reported results may be falsely lowered because of assay artifacts; sample dilution is required to measure these high values accurately. Falsely elevated values may be caused by aggregated forms of circulating PRL, which are usually biologically inactive (macroprolactinemia). Hypothyroidism should be excluded by measuring TSH and T4 levels.

Treatment: Hyperprolactinemia

Treatment of hyperprolactinemia depends on the cause of elevated PRL levels. Regardless of the etiology, however, treatment should be aimed at normalizing PRL levels to alleviate suppressive effects on gonadal function, halt galactorrhea, and preserve bone mineral density. Dopamine agonists are effective for most causes of hyperprolactinemia (see the treatment section for prolactinoma, below) regardless of the underlying cause.

If the patient is taking a medication known to cause hyperprolactinemia, the drug should be withdrawn, if possible. For psychiatric patients who require neuroleptic agents, supervised dose titration or the addition of a dopamine agonist can help restore normoprolactinemia and alleviate reproductive symptoms. However, dopamine agonists sometimes worsen the underlying psychiatric condition, especially at high doses. Hyperprolactinemia usually resolves after adequate thyroid hormone replacement in hypothyroid patients or after renal transplantation in patients undergoing dialysis. Resection of hypothalamic or sellar mass lesions can reverse hyperprolactinemia caused by stalk compression and reduced dopamine tone. Granulomatous infiltrates occasionally respond to glucocorticoid administration. In patients with irreversible hypothalamic damage, no treatment may be warranted. In up to 30% of patients with hyperprolactinemia〞usually without a visible pituitary microadenoma〞the condition may resolve spontaneously.

Prolactinoma

Etiology and Prevalence

Tumors arising from lactotrope cells account for about half of all functioning pituitary tumors, with a population prevalence of 10/100,000 in men and 30/100,000 in women. Mixed tumors that secrete combinations of GH and PRL, ACTH and PRL, and rarely TSH and PRL are also seen. These plurihormonal tumors are usually recognized by immunohistochemistry, sometimes without apparent clinical manifestations from the production of additional hormones. Microadenomas are classified as <1 cm in diameter and usually do not invade the parasellar region. Macroadenomas are >1 cm in diameter and may be locally invasive and impinge on adjacent structures. The female:male ratio for microprolactinomas is 20:1, whereas the sex ratio is near 1:1 for macroadenomas. Tumor size generally correlates directly with PRL concentrations; values >250 g/L usually are associated with macroadenomas. Men tend to present with larger tumors than women, possibly because the features of male hypogonadism are less readily evident. PRL levels remain stable in most patients, reflecting the slow growth of these tumors. About 5% of microadenomas progress in the long term to macroadenomas.

Presentation and Diagnosis

Women usually present with amenorrhea, infertility, and galactorrhea. If the tumor extends outside the sella, visual field defects or other mass effects may be seen. Men often present with impotence, loss of libido, infertility, or signs of central CNS compression, including headaches and visual defects. Assuming that physiologic and medication-induced causes of hyperprolactinemia are excluded (Table 339-9), the diagnosis of prolactinoma is likely with a PRL level >200 g/L. PRL levels <100 g/L may be caused by microadenomas, other sellar lesions that decrease dopamine inhibition, or nonneoplastic causes of hyperprolactinemia. For this reason, an MRI should be performed in all patients with hyperprolactinemia. It is important to remember that hyperprolactinemia caused secondarily by the mass effects of nonlactotrope lesions is also corrected by treatment with dopamine agonists despite failure to shrink the underlying mass. Consequently, PRL suppression by dopamine agonists does not necessarily indicate that the underlying lesion is a prolactinoma.

Treatment: Prolactinoma

As microadenomas rarely progress to become macroadenomas, no treatment may be needed if fertility is not desired. Estrogen replacement is indicated to prevent bone loss and other consequences of hypoestrogenemia and does not appear to increase the risk of tumor enlargement; these patients should be monitored by regular serial PRL and MRI measurements.

For symptomatic microadenomas, therapeutic goals include control of hyperprolactinemia, reduction of tumor size, restoration of menses and fertility, and resolution of galactorrhea. Dopamine agonist doses should be titrated to achieve maximal PRL suppression and restoration of reproductive function (Fig. 339-6). A normalized PRL level does not ensure reduced tumor size. However, tumor shrinkage usually is not seen in those who do not respond with lowered PRL levels. For macroadenomas, formal visual field testing should be performed before initiating dopamine agonists. MRI and visual fields should be assessed at 6- to 12-month intervals until the mass shrinks and annually thereafter until maximum size reduction has occurred.

Medical

Oral dopamine agonists (cabergoline and bromocriptine) are the mainstay of therapy for patients with micro- or macroprolactinomas. Dopamine agonists suppress PRL secretion and synthesis as well as lactotrope cell proliferation. In patients with microadenomas who have achieved normoprolactinemia and significant reduction of tumor mass, the dopamine agonist may be withdrawn after 2 years. These patients should be monitored carefully for evidence of prolactinoma recurrence. About 20% of patients (especially males) are resistant to dopaminergic treatment; these adenomas may exhibit decreased D2 dopamine receptor numbers or a postreceptor defect. D2 receptor gene mutations in the pituitary have not been reported.

Cabergoline

An ergoline derivative, cabergoline is a long-acting dopamine agonist with high D2 receptor affinity. The drug effectively suppresses PRL for >14 days after a single oral dose and induces prolactinoma shrinkage in most patients. Cabergoline (0.5 to 1.0 mg twice weekly) achieves normoprolactinemia and resumption of normal gonadal function in 80% of patients with microadenomas; galactorrhea improves or resolves in 90% of patients. Cabergoline normalizes PRL and shrinks 70% of macroprolactinomas. Mass effect symptoms, including headaches and visual disorders, usually improve dramatically within days after cabergoline initiation; improvement of sexual function requires several weeks of treatment but may occur before complete normalization of prolactin levels. After initial control of PRL levels has been achieved, cabergoline should be reduced to the lowest effective maintenance dose. In 5% of treated patients harboring a microadenoma, hyperprolactinemia may resolve and not recur when dopamine agonists are discontinued after long-term treatment. Cabergoline also may be effective in patients resistant to bromocriptine. Adverse effects and drug intolerance are encountered less commonly than with bromocriptine.

Bromocriptine

The ergot alkaloid bromocriptine mesylate is a dopamine receptor agonist that suppresses prolactin secretion. Because it is short-acting, the drug is preferred when pregnancy is desired. In microadenomas bromocriptine rapidly lowers serum prolactin levels to normal in up to 70% of patients, decreases tumor size, and restores gonadal function. In patients with macroadenomas, prolactin levels are also normalized in 70% of patients and tumor mass shrinkage (50%) is achieved in most patients.

Therapy is initiated by administering a low bromocriptine dose (0.625每1.25 mg) at bedtime with a snack, followed by gradually increasing the dose. Most patients are controlled with a daily dose of 7.5 mg (2.5 mg tid).

Side Effects

Side effects of dopamine agonists include constipation, nasal stuffiness, dry mouth, nightmares, insomnia, and vertigo; decreasing the dose usually alleviates these problems. Nausea, vomiting, and postural hypotension with faintness may occur in 25% of patients after the initial dose. These symptoms may persist in some patients. In general, fewer side effects are reported with cabergoline. For the approximately 15% of patients who are intolerant of oral bromocriptine, cabergoline may be better tolerated. Intravaginal administration of bromocriptine is often efficacious in patients with intractable gastrointestinal side effects. Auditory hallucinations, delusions, and mood swings have been reported in up to 5% of patients and may be due to the dopamine agonist properties or to the lysergic acid derivative of the compounds. Rare reports of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, pleural fibrosis, cardiac arrhythmias, and hepatitis have been described. Patients with Parkinson's disease who receive at least 3 mg of cabergoline daily have been reported to be at risk for development of cardiac valve regurgitation. Studies analyzing over 500 prolactinoma patients receiving recommended doses of cabergoline (up to 2 mg weekly) have shown no evidence for an increased incidence of valvular disorders. Nevertheless, as no controlled prospective studies are available, it is prudent to perform echocardiograms before initiating standard-dose cabergoline therapy.

Indications for surgical adenoma debulking include dopamine resistance or intolerance and the presence of an invasive macroadenoma with compromised vision that fails to improve after drug treatment. Initial PRL normalization is achieved in about 70% of microprolactinomas after surgical resection, but only 30% of macroadenomas can be resected successfully. Follow-up studies have shown that hyperprolactinemia recurs in up to 20% of patients within the first year after surgery; long-term recurrence rates exceed 50% for macroadenomas. Radiotherapy for prolactinomas is reserved for patients with aggressive tumors that do not respond to maximally tolerated dopamine agonists and/or surgery.

Pregnancy

The pituitary increases in size during pregnancy, reflecting the stimulatory effects of estrogen and perhaps other growth factors on pituitary vascularity and lactotrope cell hyperplasia. About 5% of microadenomas significantly increase in size, but 15每30% of macroadenomas grow during pregnancy. Bromocriptine has been used for more than 30 years to restore fertility in women with hyperprolactinemia, without evidence of teratogenic effects. Nonetheless, most authorities recommend strategies to minimize fetal exposure to the drug. For women taking bromocriptine who desire pregnancy, mechanical contraception should be used through three regular menstrual cycles to allow for conception timing. When pregnancy is confirmed, bromocriptine should be discontinued and PRL levels followed serially, especially if headaches or visual symptoms occur. For women harboring macroadenomas, regular visual field testing is recommended, and the drug should be reinstituted if tumor growth is apparent. Although pituitary MRI may be safe during pregnancy, this procedure should be reserved for symptomatic patients with severe headache and/or visual field defects. Surgical decompression may be indicated if vision is threatened. Although comprehensive data support the efficacy and relative safety of bromocriptine-facilitated fertility, patients should be advised of potential unknown deleterious effects and the risk of tumor growth during pregnancy. As cabergoline is long-acting with a high D2-receptor affinity, it is not recommended for use in women when fertility is desired.
 
Growth Hormone

Synthesis

GH is the most abundant anterior pituitary hormone, and GH-secreting somatotrope cells constitute up to 50% of the total anterior pituitary cell population. Mammosomatotrope cells, which coexpress PRL with GH, can be identified by using double immunostaining techniques. Somatotrope development and GH transcription are determined by expression of the cell-specific Pit-1 nuclear transcription factor. Five distinct genes encode GH and related proteins. The pituitary GH gene (hGH-N) produces two alternatively spliced products that give rise to 22-kDa GH (191 amino acids) and a less abundant 20-kDa GH molecule with similar biologic activity. Placental syncytiotrophoblast cells express a GH variant (hGH-V) gene; the related hormone human chorionic somatotropin (HCS) is expressed by distinct members of the gene cluster.

Secretion

GH secretion is controlled by complex hypothalamic and peripheral factors. GHRH is a 44-amino-acid hypothalamic peptide that stimulates GH synthesis and release. Ghrelin, an octanoylated gastric-derived peptide, and synthetic agonists of the GHS-R induce GHRH and also directly stimulate GH release. Somatostatin [somatotropin-release inhibiting factor (SRIF)] is synthesized in the medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus and inhibits GH secretion. GHRH is secreted in discrete spikes that elicit GH pulses, whereas SRIF sets basal GH secretory tone. SRIF also is expressed in many extrahypothalamic tissues, including the CNS, gastrointestinal tract, and pancreas, where it also acts to inhibit islet hormone secretion. IGF-I, the peripheral target hormone for GH, feeds back to inhibit GH; estrogen induces GH, whereas chronic glucocorticoid excess suppresses GH release.

Surface receptors on the somatotrope regulate GH synthesis and secretion. The GHRH receptor is a G protein每coupled receptor (GPCR) that signals through the intracellular cyclic AMP pathway to stimulate somatotrope cell proliferation as well as GH production. Inactivating mutations of the GHRH receptor cause profound dwarfism (see below). A distinct surface receptor for ghrelin, the gastric-derived GH secretagogue, is expressed in the hypothalamus and pituitary. Somatostatin binds to five distinct receptor subtypes (SSTR1 to SSTR5); SSTR2 and SSTR5 subtypes preferentially suppress GH (and TSH) secretion.

GH secretion is pulsatile, with highest peak levels occurring at night, generally correlating with sleep onset. GH secretory rates decline markedly with age so that hormone levels in middle age are about 15% of pubertal levels. These changes are paralleled by an age-related decline in lean muscle mass. GH secretion is also reduced in obese individuals, though IGF-I levels may not be suppressed, suggesting a change in the setpoint for feedback control. Elevated GH levels occur within an hour of deep sleep onset as well as after exercise, physical stress, and trauma and during sepsis. Integrated 24-h GH secretion is higher in women and is also enhanced by estrogen replacement. Using standard assays, random GH measurements are undetectable in 50% of daytime samples obtained from healthy subjects and are also undetectable in most obese and elderly subjects. Thus, single random GH measurements do not distinguish patients with adult GH deficiency from normal persons.

GH secretion is profoundly influenced by nutritional factors. Using newer ultrasensitive GH assays with a sensitivity of 0.002 g/L, a glucose load suppresses GH to <0.7 g/L in women and to <0.07 g/L in men. Increased GH pulse frequency and peak amplitudes occur with chronic malnutrition or prolonged fasting. GH is stimulated by intravenous l-arginine, dopamine, and apomorphine (a dopamine receptor agonist), as well as by -adrenergic pathways. -Adrenergic blockage induces basal GH and enhances GHRH- and insulin-evoked GH release.

Action

The pattern of GH secretion may affect tissue responses. The higher GH pulsatility observed in men compared with the relatively continuous GH secretion in women may be an important biologic determinant of linear growth patterns and liver enzyme induction.

The 70-kDa peripheral GH receptor protein has structural homology with the cytokine/hematopoietic superfamily. A fragment of the receptor extracellular domain generates a soluble GH binding protein (GHBP) that interacts with GH in the circulation. The liver and cartilage contain the greatest number of GH receptors. GH binding to preformed receptor dimers is followed by internal rotation and subsequent signaling through the JAK/STAT pathway. Activated STAT proteins translocate to the nucleus, where they modulate expression of GH-regulated target genes. GH analogues that bind to the receptor but are incapable of mediating receptor signaling are potent antagonists of GH action. A GH receptor antagonist (pegvisomant) is approved for treatment of acromegaly.

GH induces protein synthesis and nitrogen retention and impairs glucose tolerance by antagonizing insulin action. GH also stimulates lipolysis, leading to increased circulating fatty acid levels, reduced omental fat mass, and enhanced lean body mass. GH promotes sodium, potassium, and water retention and elevates serum levels of inorganic phosphate. Linear bone growth occurs as a result of complex hormonal and growth factor actions, including those of IGF-I. GH stimulates epiphyseal prechondrocyte differentiation. These precursor cells produce IGF-I locally, and their proliferation is also responsive to the growth factor.

Insulin-Like Growth Factors

Although GH exerts direct effects in target tissues, many of its physiologic effects are mediated indirectly through IGF-I, a potent growth and differentiation factor. The liver is the major source of circulating IGF-I. In peripheral tissues, IGF-I exerts local paracrine actions that appear to be both dependent on and independent of GH. Thus, GH administration induces circulating IGF-I as well as stimulating local IGF-I production in multiple tissues.

Both IGF-I and IGF-II are bound to high-affinity circulating IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) that regulate IGF bioactivity. Levels of IGFBP3 are GH-dependent, and it serves as the major carrier protein for circulating IGF-I. GH deficiency and malnutrition usually are associated with low IGFBP3 levels. IGFBP1 and IGFBP2 regulate local tissue IGF action but do not bind appreciable amounts of circulating IGF-I.

Serum IGF-I concentrations are profoundly affected by physiologic factors. Levels increase during puberty, peak at 16 years, and subsequently decline by >80% during the aging process. IGF-I concentrations are higher in women than in men. Because GH is the major determinant of hepatic IGF-I synthesis, abnormalities of GH synthesis or action (e.g., pituitary failure, GHRH receptor defect, GH receptor defect) reduce IGF-I levels. Hypocaloric states are associated with GH resistance; IGF-I levels are therefore low with cachexia, malnutrition, and sepsis. In acromegaly, IGF-I levels are invariably high and reflect a log-linear relationship with GH concentrations.

IGF-I Physiology

IGF-I has been approved for use in patients with GH-resistance syndromes. Injected IGF-I (100 g/kg) induces hypoglycemia, and lower doses improve insulin sensitivity in patients with severe insulin resistance and diabetes. In cachectic subjects, IGF-I infusion (12 g/kg per hour) enhances nitrogen retention and lowers cholesterol levels. Longer-term subcutaneous IGF-I injections enhance protein synthesis and are anabolic. Although bone formation markers are induced, bone turnover also may be stimulated by IGF-I.

IGF-I side effects are dose-dependent, and overdose may result in hypoglycemia, hypotension, fluid retention, temporomandibular jaw pain, and increased intracranial pressure, all of which are reversible. Avascular femoral head necrosis has been reported. Chronic excess IGF-I administration presumably would result in features of acromegaly.

Disorders of Growth and Development

Skeletal Maturation and Somatic Growth

The growth plate is dependent on a variety of hormonal stimuli, including GH, IGF-I, sex steroids, thyroid hormones, paracrine growth factors, and cytokines. The growth-promoting process also requires caloric energy, amino acids, vitamins, and trace metals and consumes about 10% of normal energy production. Malnutrition impairs chondrocyte activity and reduces circulating IGF-I and IGFBP3 levels.

Linear bone growth rates are very high in infancy and are pituitary-dependent. Mean growth velocity is 6 cm/year in later childhood and usually is maintained within a given range on a standardized percentile chart. Peak growth rates occur during midpuberty when bone age is 12 (girls) or 13 (boys). Secondary sexual development is associated with elevated sex steroids that cause progressive epiphyseal growth plate closure. Bone age is delayed in patients with all forms of true GH deficiency or GH receptor defects that result in attenuated GH action.

Short stature may occur as a result of constitutive intrinsic growth defects or because of acquired extrinsic factors that impair growth. In general, delayed bone age in a child with short stature is suggestive of a hormonal or systemic disorder, whereas normal bone age in a short child is more likely to be caused by a genetic cartilage dysplasia or growth plate disorder (Chap. 363).

GH Deficiency in Children

GH Deficiency

Isolated GH deficiency is characterized by short stature, micropenis, increased fat, high-pitched voice, and a propensity to hypoglycemia due to relatively unopposed insulin action. Familial modes of inheritance are seen in one-third of these individuals and may be autosomal dominant, recessive, or X-linked. About 10% of children with GH deficiency have mutations in the GH-N gene, including gene deletions and a wide range of point mutations. Mutations in transcription factors Pit-1 and Prop-1, which control somatotrope development result in GH deficiency in combination with other pituitary hormone deficiencies, which may become manifest only in adulthood. The diagnosis of idiopathic GH deficiency (IGHD) should be made only after known molecular defects have been rigorously excluded.

GHRH Receptor Mutations

Recessive mutations of the GHRH receptor gene in subjects with severe proportionate dwarfism are associated with low basal GH levels that cannot be stimulated by exogenous GHRH, GHRP, or insulin-induced hypoglycemia, as well as anterior pituitary hypoplasia The syndrome exemplifies the importance of the GHRH receptor for somatotrope cell proliferation and hormonal responsiveness.

Growth Hormone Insensitivity

This is caused by defects of GH receptor structure or signaling. Homozygous or heterozygous mutations of the GH receptor are associated with partial or complete GH insensitivity and growth failure (Laron syndrome). The diagnosis is based on normal or high GH levels, with decreased circulating GHBP, and low IGF-I levels. Very rarely, defective IGF-I, IGF-I receptor, or IGF-I signaling defects are also encountered. STAT5B mutations result in immunodeficiency with abrogated GH signaling, leading to short stature with normal or elevated GH levels and low IGF-I levels.

Nutritional Short Stature

Caloric deprivation and malnutrition, uncontrolled diabetes, and chronic renal failure represent secondary causes of abrogated GH receptor function. These conditions also stimulate production of proinflammatory cytokines, which act to exacerbate the block of GH-mediated signal transduction. Children with these conditions typically exhibit features of acquired short stature with normal or elevated GH, and low IGF-I levels. Circulating GH receptor antibodies may rarely cause peripheral GH insensitivity.

Psychosocial Short Stature

Emotional and social deprivation lead to growth retardation accompanied by delayed speech, discordant hyperphagia, and an attenuated response to administered GH. A nurturing environment restores growth rates.

Presentation and Diagnosis

Short stature is commonly encountered in clinical practice, and the decision to evaluate these children requires clinical judgment in association with auxologic data and family history. Short stature should be evaluated comprehensively if a patient's height is >3 standard deviations (SD) below the mean for age or if the growth rate has decelerated. Skeletal maturation is best evaluated by measuring a radiologic bone age, which is based mainly on the degree of wrist bone growth plate fusion. Final height can be predicted using standardized scales (Bayley-Pinneau or Tanner-Whitehouse) or estimated by adding 6.5 cm (boys) or subtracting 6.5 cm (girls) from the midparental height.

Laboratory Investigation

Because GH secretion is pulsatile, GH deficiency is best assessed by examining the response to provocative stimuli, including exercise, insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and other pharmacologic tests that normally increase GH to >7 g/L in children. Random GH measurements do not distinguish normal children from those with true GH deficiency. Adequate adrenal and thyroid hormone replacement should be assured before testing. Age- and sex-matched IGF-I levels are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to make the diagnosis but can be useful to confirm GH deficiency. Pituitary MRI may reveal pituitary mass lesions or structural defects. Molecular analyses for known mutations should be undertaken when the cause of short stature remains cryptic, or when additional clinical features suggest a gentic cause.

Treatment: Disorders of Growth and Development

Replacement therapy with recombinant GH (0.02每0.05 mg/kg per day subcutaneously) restores growth velocity in GH-deficient children to 10 cm/year. If pituitary insufficiency is documented, other associated hormone deficits should be corrected〞especially adrenal steroids. GH treatment is also moderately effective for accelerating growth rates in children with Turner syndrome and chronic renal failure.

In patients with GH insensitivity and growth retardation due to mutations of the GH receptor, treatment with IGF-I bypasses the dysfunctional GH receptor.

Adult GH Deficiency (Aghd)

This disorder usually is caused by hypothalamic or pituitary somatotrope damage. Acquired pituitary hormone deficiency follows a typical pattern in which loss of adequate GH reserve foreshadows subsequent hormone deficits. The sequential order of hormone loss is usually GH  FSH/LH  TSH  ACTH.

Presentation and Diagnosis

The clinical features of AGHD include changes in body composition, lipid metabolism, and quality of life and cardiovascular dysfunction (Table 339-10). Body composition changes are common and include reduced lean body mass, increased fat mass with selective deposition of intraabdominal visceral fat, and increased waist-to-hip ratio. Hyperlipidemia, left ventricular dysfunction, hypertension, and increased plasma fibrinogen levels also may be present. Bone mineral content is reduced, with resultant increased fracture rates. Patients may experience social isolation, depression, and difficulty maintaining gainful employment. Adult hypopituitarism is associated with a threefold increase in cardiovascular mortality rates in comparison to age- and sex-matched controls, and this may be due to GH deficiency, as patients in these studies were replaced with other deficient pituitary hormones.

Laboratory Investigation

AGHD is rare, and in light of the nonspecific nature of associated clinical symptoms, patients appropriate for testing should be selected carefully on the basis of well-defined criteria. With few exceptions, testing should be restricted to patients with the following predisposing factors: (1) pituitary surgery, (2) pituitary or hypothalamic tumor or granulomas, (3) history of cranial irradiation, (4) radiologic evidence of a pituitary lesion, (5) childhood requirement for GH replacement therapy, and rarely (6) unexplained low age- and sex-matched IGF-I levels. The transition of a GH-deficient adolescent to adulthood requires retesting to document subsequent adult GH deficiency. Up to 20% of patients previously treated for childhood-onset GH deficiency are found to be GH-sufficient on repeat testing as adults.

A significant proportion (25%) of truly GH-deficient adults have low-normal IGF-I levels. Thus, as in the evaluation of GH deficiency in children, valid age- and sex-matched IGF-I measurements provide a useful index of therapeutic responses but are not sufficiently sensitive for diagnostic purposes. The most validated test to distinguish pituitary-sufficient patients from those with AGHD is insulin-induced (0.05每0.1 U/kg) hypoglycemia. After glucose reduction to 40 mg/dL, most individuals experience neuroglycopenic symptoms (Chap. 345), and peak GH release occurs at 60 min and remains elevated for up to 2 h. About 90% of healthy adults exhibit GH responses >5 g/L; AGHD is defined by a peak GH response to hypoglycemia of <3 g/L. Although insulin-induced hypoglycemia is safe when performed under appropriate supervision, it is contraindicated in patients with diabetes, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, or epilepsy and in elderly patients. Alternative stimulatory tests include intravenous arginine (30 g), GHRH (1 g/kg), GHRP-6 (90 g) and in glucagon (1 mg). Combinations of these tests may evoke GH secretion in subjects who are not responsive to a single test.

Treatment: Adult GH Deficiency

Once the diagnosis of AGHD is unequivocally established, replacement of GH may be indicated. Contraindications to therapy include the presence of an active neoplasm, intracranial hypertension, and uncontrolled diabetes and retinopathy. The starting dose of 0.1每0.2 mg/d should be titrated (up to a maximum of 1.25 mg/d) to maintain IGF-I levels in the mid-normal range for age- and sex-matched controls (Fig. 339-7). Women require higher doses than men, and elderly patients require less GH. Long-term GH maintenance sustains normal IGF-I levels and is associated with persistent body composition changes (e.g., enhanced lean body mass and lower body fat). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increases, but total cholesterol and insulin levels do not change significantly. Lumbar spine bone mineral density increases, but this response is gradual (>1 year). Many patients note significant improvement in quality of life when evaluated by standardized questionnaires. The effect of GH replacement on mortality rates in GH-deficient patients is currently the subject of long-term prospective investigation.

About 30% of patients exhibit reversible dose-related fluid retention, joint pain, and carpal tunnel syndrome, and up to 40% exhibit myalgias and paresthesia. Patients receiving insulin require careful monitoring for dosing adjustments, as GH is a potent counterregulatory hormone for insulin action. Patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus initially develop further insulin resistance. However, glycemic control improves with the sustained loss of abdominal fat associated with long-term GH replacement. Headache, increased intracranial pressure, hypertension, and tinnitus occur rarely. Pituitary tumor regrowth and progression of skin lesions or other tumors are being assessed in long-term surveillance programs. To date, development of these potential side effects does not appear significant.

Acromegaly

Etiology

GH hypersecretion is usually the result of a somatotrope adenoma but may rarely be caused by extrapituitary lesions (Table 339-11). In addition to more common GH-secreting somatotrope adenomas, mixed mammosomatotrope tumors and acidophilic stem-cell adenomas secrete both GH and PRL. In patients with acidophilic stem-cell adenomas, features of hyperprolactinemia (hypogonadism and galactorrhea) predominate over the less clinically evident signs of acromegaly. Occasionally, mixed plurihormonal tumors are encountered that also secrete ACTH, the glycoprotein hormone  subunit, or TSH in addition to GH. Patients with partially empty sellas may present with GH hypersecretion due to a small GH-secreting adenoma within the compressed rim of pituitary tissue; some of these may reflect the spontaneous necrosis of tumors that were previously larger. GH-secreting tumors rarely arise from ectopic pituitary tissue remnants in the nasopharynx or midline sinuses.

There are case reports of ectopic GH secretion by tumors of pancreatic, ovarian, lung, or hematopoietic origin. Rarely, excess GHRH production may cause acromegaly because of chronic stimulation of somatotropes. These patients present with classic features of acromegaly, elevated GH levels, pituitary enlargement on MRI, and pathologic characteristics of pituitary hyperplasia. The most common cause of GHRH-mediated acromegaly is a chest or abdominal carcinoid tumor. Although these tumors usually express positive GHRH immunoreactivity, clinical features of acromegaly are evident in only a minority of patients with carcinoid disease. Excessive GHRH also may be elaborated by hypothalamic tumors, usually choristomas or neuromas.

Presentation and Diagnosis

Protean manifestations of GH and IGF-I hypersecretion are indolent and often are not clinically diagnosed for 10 years or more. Acral bony overgrowth results in frontal bossing, increased hand and foot size, mandibular enlargement with prognathism, and widened space between the lower incisor teeth. In children and adolescents, initiation of GH hypersecretion before epiphyseal long bone closure is associated with development of pituitary gigantism (Fig. 339-8). Soft tissue swelling results in increased heel pad thickness, increased shoe or glove size, ring tightening, characteristic coarse facial features, and a large fleshy nose. Other commonly encountered clinical features include hyperhidrosis, a deep and hollow-sounding voice, oily skin, arthropathy, kyphosis, carpal tunnel syndrome, proximal muscle weakness and fatigue, acanthosis nigricans, and skin tags. Generalized visceromegaly occurs, including cardiomegaly, macroglossia, and thyroid gland enlargement.

The most significant clinical impact of GH excess occurs with respect to the cardiovascular system. Coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy with arrhythmias, left ventricular hypertrophy, decreased diastolic function, and hypertension ultimately occur in most patients if untreated. Upper airway obstruction with sleep apnea occurs in more than 60% of patients and is associated with both soft tissue laryngeal airway obstruction and central sleep dysfunction. Diabetes mellitus develops in 25% of patients with acromegaly, and most patients are intolerant of a glucose load (as GH counteracts the action of insulin). Acromegaly is associated with an increased risk of colon polyps and mortality from colonic malignancy; polyps are diagnosed in up to one-third of patients. Overall mortality is increased about threefold and is due primarily to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders and respiratory disease. Unless GH levels are controlled, survival is reduced by an average of 10 years compared with an age-matched control population.

Laboratory Investigation

Age- and sex-matched serum IGF-I levels are elevated in acromegaly. Consequently, an IGF-I level provides a useful laboratory screening measure when clinical features raise the possibility of acromegaly. Due to the pulsatility of GH secretion, measurement of a single random GH level is not useful for the diagnosis or exclusion of acromegaly and does not correlate with disease severity. The diagnosis of acromegaly is confirmed by demonstrating the failure of GH suppression to <0.4 g/L within 1每2 h of an oral glucose load (75 g). When newer ultrasensitive GH assays are used, normal nadir GH levels are even lower (<0.05 g/L). About 20% of patients exhibit a paradoxical GH rise after glucose. PRL should be measured, as it is elevated in 25% of patients with acromegaly. Thyroid function, gonadotropins, and sex steroids may be attenuated because of tumor mass effects. Because most patients will undergo surgery with glucocorticoid coverage, tests of ACTH reserve in asymptomatic patients are more efficiently deferred until after surgery.

Treatment: Acromegaly

The goal of treatment is to control GH and IGF-I hypersecretion, ablate or arrest tumor growth, ameliorate comorbidities, restore mortality rates to normal, and preserve pituitary function.

Surgical resection of GH-secreting adenomas is the initial treatment for most patients (Fig. 339-9). Somatostatin analogues are used as adjuvant treatment for preoperative shrinkage of large invasive macroadenomas, immediate relief of debilitating symptoms, and reduction of GH hypersecretion; in frail patients experiencing morbidity; and in patients who decline surgery or, when surgery fails, to achieve biochemical control. Irradiation or repeat surgery may be required for patients who cannot tolerate or do not respond to adjunctive medical therapy. The high rate of late hypopituitarism and the slow rate (5每15 years) of biochemical response are the main disadvantages of radiotherapy. Irradiation is also relatively ineffective in normalizing IGF-I levels. Stereotactic ablation of GH-secreting adenomas by gamma-knife radiotherapy is promising, but initial reports suggest that long-term results and side effects are similar to those observed with conventional radiation. Somatostatin analogues may be required while awaiting the full benefits of radiotherapy. Systemic sequelae of acromegaly, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and arthritis, should be managed aggressively. Mandibular surgical repair may be indicated.

Surgery

Transsphenoidal surgical resection by an experienced surgeon is the preferred primary treatment for both microadenomas (cure rate 70%) and macroadenomas (<50% cured). Soft tissue swelling improves immediately after tumor resection. GH levels return to normal within an hour, and IGF-I levels are normalized within 3每4 days. In 10% of patients, acromegaly may recur several years after apparently successful surgery; hypopituitarism develops in up to 15% of patients after surgery.

Somatostatin Analogues

Somatostatin analogues exert their therapeutic effects through SSTR2 and SSTR5 receptors, both of which invariably are expressed by GH-secreting tumors. Octreotide acetate is an eight-amino-acid synthetic somatostatin analogue. In contrast to native somatostatin, the analogue is relatively resistant to plasma degradation. It has a 2-h serum half-life and possesses fortyfold greater potency than native somatostatin to suppress GH. Octreotide is administered by subcutaneous injection, beginning with 50 g tid; the dose can be increased gradually up to 1500 g/d. Fewer than 10% of patients do not respond to the analogue. Octreotide suppresses integrated GH levels and normalizes IGF-I levels in 75% of treated patients.

The long-acting somatostatin depot formulations, octreotide and lanreotide, are the preferred medical treatment for patients with acromegaly. Sandostatin-LAR is a sustained-release, long-acting formulation of octreotide incorporated into microspheres that sustain drug levels for several weeks after intramuscular injection. GH suppression occurs for as long as 6 weeks after a 30-mg intramuscular injection; long-term monthly treatment sustains GH and IGF-I suppression and also reduces pituitary tumor size in 50% of patients. Lanreotide autogel, a slow-release depot somatostatin preparation, is a cyclic somatostatin octapeptide analogue that suppresses GH and IGF-I hypersecretion after a 60-mg subcutaneous injection. Long-term monthly administration controls GH hypersecretion in two-thirds of treated patients and improves patient compliance because of the long interval required between drug injections. Rapid relief of headache and soft tissue swelling occurs in 75% of patients within days to weeks of somatostatin analogue initiation. Most patients report symptomatic improvement, including amelioration of headache, perspiration, obstructive apnea, and cardiac failure.

Side Effects

Somatostatin analogues are well tolerated in most patients. Adverse effects are short-lived and mostly relate to drug-induced suppression of gastrointestinal motility and secretion. Nausea, abdominal discomfort, fat malabsorption, diarrhea, and flatulence occur in one-third of patients, and these symptoms usually remit within 2 weeks. Octreotide suppresses postprandial gallbladder contractility and delays gallbladder emptying; up to 30% of patients develop long-term echogenic sludge or asymptomatic cholesterol gallstones. Other side effects include mild glucose intolerance due to transient insulin suppression, asymptomatic bradycardia, hypothyroxinemia, and local injection site discomfort.

GH Receptor Antagonist

Pegvisomant antagonizes endogenous GH action by blocking peripheral GH binding to its receptor. Consequently, serum IGF-I levels are suppressed, reducing the deleterious effects of excess endogenous GH. Pegvisomant is administered by daily subcutaneous injection (10每20 mg) and normalizes IGF-I in >90% of patients. GH levels, however, remain elevated as the drug does not have antitumor actions. Side effects include reversible liver enzyme elevation, lipodystrophy, and injection site pain. Tumor size should be monitored by MRI.

Combined treatment with monthly somatostatin analogues and weekly or biweekly pegvisomant injections has been used effectively in resistant patients.

Dopamine Agonists

Bromocriptine and cabergoline may modestly suppress GH secretion in some patients. High doses of bromocriptine (20 mg/d) or cabergoline (0.5 mg/d) are usually required to achieve modest GH therapeutic efficacy. Combined treatment with octreotide and cabergoline may induce additive biochemical control compared with either drug alone.

Radiation

External radiation therapy or high-energy stereotactic techniques are used as adjuvant therapy for acromegaly. An advantage of radiation is that patient compliance with long-term treatment is not required. Tumor mass is reduced, and GH levels are attenuated over time. However, 50% of patients require at least 8 years for GH levels to be suppressed to <5 g/L; this level of GH reduction is achieved in about 90% of patients after 18 years but represents suboptimal GH suppression. Patients may require interim medical therapy for several years before attaining maximal radiation benefits. Most patients also experience hypothalamic-pituitary damage, leading to gonadotropin, ACTH, and/or TSH deficiency within 10 years of therapy.

In summary, surgery is the preferred primary treatment for GH-secreting microadenomas (Fig. 339-9). The high frequency of GH hypersecretion after macroadenoma resection usually necessitates adjuvant or primary medical therapy for these larger tumors. Patients unable to receive or respond to unimodal medical treatment may benefit from combined treatments or can be offered radiation.
 
Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (See Also Chap. 342)

Synthesis

ACTH-secreting corticotrope cells constitute about 20% of the pituitary cell population. ACTH (39 amino acids) is derived from the POMC precursor protein (266 amino acids) that also generates several other peptides, including -lipotropin, -endorphin, met-enkephalin, -melanocyte-stimulating hormone (-MSH), and corticotropin-like intermediate lobe protein (CLIP). The POMC gene is potently suppressed by glucocorticoids and induced by CRH, arginine vasopressin (AVP), and proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, as well as leukemia inhibitory factor.

CRH, a 41-amino-acid hypothalamic peptide synthesized in the paraventricular nucleus as well as in higher brain centers, is the predominant stimulator of ACTH synthesis and release. The CRH receptor is a GPCR that is expressed on the corticotrope and signals to induce POMC transcription.

Secretion

ACTH secretion is pulsatile and exhibits a characteristic circadian rhythm, peaking at 6 a.m. and reaching a nadir about midnight. Adrenal glucocorticoid secretion, which is driven by ACTH, follows a parallel diurnal pattern. ACTH circadian rhythmicity is determined by variations in secretory pulse amplitude rather than changes in pulse frequency. Superimposed on this endogenous rhythm, ACTH levels are increased by physical and psychological stress, exercise, acute illness, and insulin-induced hypoglycemia.

Loss of cortisol feedback inhibition, as occurs in primary adrenal failure, results in extremely high ACTH levels. Glucocorticoid-mediated negative regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis occurs as a consequence of both hypothalamic CRH suppression and direct attenuation of pituitary POMC gene expression and ACTH release.

Acute inflammatory or septic insults activate the HPA axis through the integrated actions of proinflammatory cytokines, bacterial toxins, and neural signals. The overlapping cascade of ACTH-inducing cytokines [tumor necrosis factor (TNF); IL-1, -2, and -6; and leukemia inhibitory factor] activates hypothalamic CRH and AVP secretion, pituitary POMC gene expression, and local pituitary paracrine cytokine networks. The resulting cortisol elevation restrains the inflammatory response and enables host protection. Concomitantly, cytokine-mediated central glucocorticoid receptor resistance impairs glucocorticoid suppression of the HPA. Thus, the neuroendocrine stress response reflects the net result of highly integrated hypothalamic, intrapituitary, and peripheral hormone and cytokine signals.

Action

The major function of the HPA axis is to maintain metabolic homeostasis and mediate the neuroendocrine stress response. ACTH induces adrenocortical steroidogenesis by sustaining adrenal cell proliferation and function. The receptor for ACTH, designated melanocortin-2 receptor, is a GPCR that induces steroidogenesis by stimulating a cascade of steroidogenic enzymes (Chap. 342).

ACTH Deficiency

Presentation and Diagnosis

Secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs as a result of pituitary ACTH deficiency. It is characterized by fatigue, weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and, occasionally, hypoglycemia. In contrast to primary adrenal failure, hypocortisolism associated with pituitary failure usually is not accompanied by hyperpigmentation or mineralocorticoid deficiency.

ACTH deficiency is commonly due to glucocorticoid withdrawal after treatment-associated suppression of the HPA axis. Isolated ACTH deficiency may occur after surgical resection of an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma that has suppressed the HPA axis; this phenomenon is suggestive of a surgical cure. The mass effects of other pituitary adenomas or sellar lesions may lead to ACTH deficiency, but usually in combination with other pituitary hormone deficiencies. Partial ACTH deficiency may be unmasked in the presence of an acute medical or surgical illness, when clinically significant hypocortisolism reflects diminished ACTH reserve. Rarely, TPIT or POMC mutations result in primary ACTH deficiency.

Laboratory Diagnosis

Inappropriately low ACTH levels in the setting of low cortisol levels are characteristic of diminished ACTH reserve. Low basal serum cortisol levels are associated with blunted cortisol responses to ACTH stimulation and impaired cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, or testing with metyrapone or CRH. For a description of provocative ACTH tests, see Chap. 342.

Treatment: ACTH Deficiency

Glucocorticoid replacement therapy improves most features of ACTH deficiency. The total daily dose of hydrocortisone replacement preferably should not exceed 25 mg daily, divided into two or three doses. Prednisone (5 mg each morning) is longer-acting and has fewer mineralocorticoid effects than hydrocortisone. Some authorities advocate lower maintenance doses in an effort to avoid cushingoid side effects. Doses should be increased severalfold during periods of acute illness or stress.

Cushing's Syndrome (ACTH-Producing Adenoma)

(See also Chap. 342)

Etiology and Prevalence

Pituitary corticotrope adenomas account for 70% of patients with endogenous causes of Cushing's syndrome. However, it should be emphasized that iatrogenic hypercortisolism is the most common cause of cushingoid features. Ectopic tumor ACTH production, cortisol-producing adrenal adenomas, adrenal carcinoma, and adrenal hyperplasia account for the other causes; rarely, ectopic tumor CRH production is encountered.

ACTH-producing adenomas account for about 10每15% of all pituitary tumors. Because the clinical features of Cushing's syndrome often lead to early diagnosis, most ACTH-producing pituitary tumors are relatively small microadenomas. However, macroadenomas also are seen while some ACTH-expressing adenomas are clinically silent. Cushing's disease is 5每10 times more common in women than in men. These pituitary adenomas exhibit unrestrained ACTH secretion, with resultant hypercortisolemia. However, they retain partial suppressibility in the presence of high doses of administered glucocorticoids, providing the basis for dynamic testing to distinguish pituitary from nonpituitary causes of Cushing's syndrome.

Presentation and Diagnosis

The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome presents two great challenges: (1) to distinguish patients with pathologic cortisol excess from those with physiologic or other disturbances of cortisol production and (2) to determine the etiology of cortisol excess.

Typical features of chronic cortisol excess include thin skin, central obesity, hypertension, plethoric moon facies, purple striae and easy bruisability, glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus, gonadal dysfunction, osteoporosis, proximal muscle weakness, signs of hyperandrogenism (acne, hirsutism), and psychological disturbances (depression, mania, and psychoses) (Table 339-12). Hematopoietic features of hypercortisolism include leukocytosis, lymphopenia, and eosinopenia. Immune suppression includes delayed hypersensitivity. These protean yet commonly encountered manifestations of hypercortisolism make it challenging to decide which patients mandate formal laboratory evaluation. Certain features make pathologic causes of hypercortisolism more likely; they include characteristic central redistribution of fat, thin skin with striae and bruising, and proximal muscle weakness. In children and in young females, early osteoporosis may be particularly prominent. The primary cause of death is cardiovascular disease, but infections and risk of suicide are also increased.

Rapid development of features of hypercortisolism associated with skin hyperpigmentation and severe myopathy suggests an ectopic source of ACTH. Hypertension, hypokalemic alkalosis, glucose intolerance, and edema are also more pronounced in these patients. Serum potassium levels <3.3 mmol/L are evident in 70% of patients with ectopic ACTH secretion but are seen in <10% of patients with pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome.

Laboratory Investigation

The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is based on laboratory documentation of endogenous hypercortisolism. Measurement of 24-h urine free cortisol (UFC) is a precise and cost-effective screening test. Alternatively, the failure to suppress plasma cortisol after an overnight 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test can be used to identify patients with hypercortisolism. As nadir levels of cortisol occur at night, elevated midnight samples of cortisol are suggestive of Cushing's syndrome. Basal plasma ACTH levels often distinguish patients with ACTH-independent (adrenal or exogenous glucocorticoid) from those with ACTH-dependent (pituitary, ectopic ACTH) Cushing's syndrome. Mean basal ACTH levels are about eightfold higher in patients with ectopic ACTH secretion than in those with pituitary ACTH-secreting adenomas. However, extensive overlap of ACTH levels in these two disorders precludes using ACTH measurements to make the distinction. Instead, dynamic testing based on differential sensitivity to glucocorticoid feedback or ACTH stimulation in response to CRH or cortisol reduction is used to distinguish ectopic from pituitary sources of excess ACTH (Table 339-13). Very rarely, circulating CRH levels are elevated, reflecting ectopic tumor-derived secretion of CRH and often ACTH. For further discussion of dynamic testing for Cushing's syndrome, see Chap. 342.

Most ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors are <5 mm in diameter, and about half are undetectable by sensitive MRI. The high prevalence of incidental pituitary microadenomas diminishes the ability to distinguish ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors accurately from nonsecreting incidentalomas.

Inferior Petrosal Venous Sampling

Because pituitary MRI with gadolinium enhancement is insufficiently sensitive to detect small (<2 mm) pituitary ACTH-secreting adenomas, bilateral inferior petrosal sinus ACTH sampling before and after CRH administration may be required to distinguish these lesions from ectopic ACTH-secreting tumors that may have similar clinical and biochemical characteristics. Simultaneous assessment of ACTH in each inferior petrosal vein and in the peripheral circulation provides a strategy for confirming and localizing pituitary ACTH production. Sampling is performed at baseline and 2, 5, and 10 min after intravenous bovine CRH (1 g/kg) injection. An increased ratio (>2) of inferior petrosal:peripheral vein ACTH confirms pituitary Cushing's syndrome. After CRH injection, peak petrosal:peripheral ACTH ratios 3 confirm the presence of a pituitary ACTH-secreting tumor. The sensitivity of this test is >95%, with very rare false-positive results. False-negative results may be encountered in patients with aberrant venous drainage. Petrosal sinus catheterizations are technically difficult, and about 0.05% of patients develop neurovascular complications. The procedure should not be performed in patients with hypertension or in the presence of a well-visualized pituitary adenoma on MRI.

Treatment: Cushing's Syndrome

Selective transsphenoidal resection is the treatment of choice for Cushing's disease (Fig. 339-10). The remission rate for this procedure is 80% for microadenomas but <50% for macroadenomas. After successful tumor resection, most patients experience a postoperative period of symptomatic ACTH deficiency that may last up to 12 months. This usually requires low-dose cortisol replacement, as patients experience both steroid withdrawal symptoms and have a suppressed HPA axis. Biochemical recurrence occurs in approximately 5% of patients in whom surgery was initially successful.

When initial surgery is unsuccessful, repeat surgery is sometimes indicated, particularly when a pituitary source for ACTH is well documented. In older patients, in whom issues of growth and fertility are less important, hemi- or total hypophysectomy may be necessary if a discrete pituitary adenoma is not recognized. Pituitary irradiation may be used after unsuccessful surgery, but it cures only about 15% of patients. Because the effects of radiation are slow and only partially effective in adults, steroidogenic inhibitors are used in combination with pituitary irradiation to block adrenal effects of persistently high ACTH levels.

Ketoconazole, an imidazole derivative antimycotic agent, inhibits several P450 enzymes and effectively lowers cortisol in most patients with Cushing's disease when administered twice daily (600每1200 mg/d). Elevated hepatic transaminases, gynecomastia, impotence, gastrointestinal upset, and edema are common side effects. Metyrapone (2每4 g/d) inhibits 11-hydroxylase activity and normalizes plasma cortisol in up to 75% of patients. Side effects include nausea and vomiting, rash, and exacerbation of acne or hirsutism. Mitotane (o,p∩-DDD; 3每6 g/d orally in four divided doses) suppresses cortisol hypersecretion by inhibiting 11-hydroxylase and cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzymes and by destroying adrenocortical cells. Side effects of mitotane include gastrointestinal symptoms, dizziness, gynecomastia, hyperlipidemia, skin rash, and hepatic enzyme elevation. It also may lead to hypoaldosteronism. Other agents include aminoglutethimide (250 mg tid), trilostane (200每1000 mg/d), cyproheptadine (24 mg/d), and IV etomidate (0.3 mg/kg per hour). Glucocorticoid insufficiency is a potential side effect of agents used to block steroidogenesis.

The use of steroidogenic inhibitors has decreased the need for bilateral adrenalectomy. Removal of both adrenal glands corrects hypercortisolism but may be associated with significant morbidity rates and necessitates permanent glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement. Adrenalectomy in the setting of residual corticotrope adenoma tissue predisposes to the development of Nelson's syndrome, a disorder characterized by rapid pituitary tumor enlargement and increased pigmentation secondary to high ACTH levels. Radiation therapy may be indicated to prevent the development of Nelson's syndrome after adrenalectomy.
 
Gonadotropins: FSH and LH

Synthesis and Secretion

Gonadotrope cells constitute about 10% of anterior pituitary cells and produce two gonadotropins〞LH and FSH. Like TSH and hCG, LH and FSH are glycoprotein hormones that consist of  and  subunits. The  subunit is common to these glycoprotein hormones; specificity is conferred by the  subunits, which are expressed by separate genes.

Gonadotropin synthesis and release are dynamically regulated. This is particularly true in women, in whom rapidly fluctuating gonadal steroid levels vary throughout the menstrual cycle. Hypothalamic GnRH, a 10-amino-acid peptide, regulates the synthesis and secretion of both LH and FSH. GnRH is secreted in discrete pulses every 60每120 min, and the pulses in turn elicit LH and FSH pulses (Fig. 339-3). The pulsatile mode of GnRH input is essential to its action; pulses prime gonadotrope responsiveness, whereas continuous GnRH exposure induces desensitization. Based on this phenomenon, long-acting GnRH agonists are used to suppress gonadotropin levels in children with precocious puberty and in men with prostate cancer (Chap. 95) and are used in some ovulation-induction protocols to reduce levels of endogenous gonadotropins (Chap. 347). Estrogens act at both the hypothalamus and the pituitary to modulate gonadotropin secretion. Chronic estrogen exposure is inhibitory, whereas rising estrogen levels, as occur during the preovulatory surge, exert positive feedback to increase gonadotropin pulse frequency and amplitude. Progesterone slows GnRH pulse frequency but enhances gonadotropin responses to GnRH. Testosterone feedback in men also occurs at the hypothalamic and pituitary levels and is mediated in part by its conversion to estrogens.

Although GnRH is the main regulator of LH and FSH secretion, FSH synthesis is also under separate control by the gonadal peptides inhibin and activin, which are members of the transforming growth factor  (TGF-) family. Inhibin selectively suppresses FSH, whereas activin stimulates FSH synthesis (Chap. 347).

Action

The gonadotropin hormones interact with their respective GPCRs expressed in the ovary and testis, evoking germ-cell development and maturation and steroid hormone biosynthesis. In women, FSH regulates ovarian follicle development and stimulates ovarian estrogen production. LH mediates ovulation and maintenance of the corpus luteum. In men, LH induces Leydig cell testosterone synthesis and secretion and FSH stimulates seminiferous tubule development and regulates spermatogenesis.

Gonadotropin Deficiency

Hypogonadism is the most common presenting feature of adult hypopituitarism even when other pituitary hormones are also deficient. It is often a harbinger of hypothalamic or pituitary lesions that impair GnRH production or delivery through the pituitary stalk. As noted above, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a common presenting feature of hyperprolactinemia.

A variety of inherited and acquired disorders are associated with isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) (Chap. 346). Hypothalamic defects associated with GnRH deficiency include two X-linked disorders, Kallmann syndrome (see above) and mutations in the DAX1 gene, as well as dominant mutations in FGFR1. Mutations in GPR54, kisspeptin, the GnRH receptor, and the LH  or FSH  subunit genes are additional causes of selective gonadotropin deficiency. Acquired forms of GnRH deficiency leading to hypogonadotropism are seen in association with anorexia nervosa (Chap. 79), stress, starvation, and extreme exercise but also may be idiopathic. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in these disorders is reversed by removal of the stressful stimulus or by caloric replenishment.

Presentation and Diagnosis

In premenopausal women, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism presents as diminished ovarian function leading to oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, infertility, decreased vaginal secretions, decreased libido, and breast atrophy. In hypogonadal adult men, secondary testicular failure is associated with decreased libido and potency, infertility, decreased muscle mass with weakness, reduced beard and body hair growth, soft testes, and characteristic fine facial wrinkles. Osteoporosis occurs in both untreated hypogonadal women and men.

Laboratory Investigation

Central hypogonadism is associated with low or inappropriately normal serum gonadotropin levels in the setting of low sex hormone concentrations (testosterone in men, estradiol in women). Because gonadotropin secretion is pulsatile, valid assessments may require repeated measurements or the use of pooled serum samples. Men have reduced sperm counts.

Intravenous GnRH (100 g) stimulates gonadotropes to secrete LH (which peaks within 30 min) and FSH (which plateaus during the ensuing 60 min). Normal responses vary according to menstrual cycle stage, age, and sex of the patient. Generally, LH levels increase about threefold, whereas FSH responses are less pronounced. In the setting of gonadotropin deficiency, a normal gonadotropin response to GnRH indicates intact pituitary gonadotrope function and suggests a hypothalamic abnormality. An absent response, however, cannot reliably distinguish pituitary from hypothalamic causes of hypogonadism. For this reason, GnRH testing usually adds little to the information gained from baseline evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadotrope axis except in cases of isolated GnRH deficiency (e.g., Kallmann syndrome).

MRI examination of the sellar region and assessment of other pituitary functions usually are indicated in patients with documented central hypogonadism.

Treatment: Gonadotropin Defi Ciency

In males, testosterone replacement is necessary to achieve and maintain normal growth and development of the external genitalia, secondary sex characteristics, male sexual behavior, and androgenic anabolic effects, including maintenance of muscle function and bone mass. Testosterone may be administered by intramuscular injections every 1每4 weeks or by using skin patches that are replaced daily (Chap. 346). Testosterone gels are also available. Gonadotropin injections [hCG or human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG)] over 12每18 months are used to restore fertility. Pulsatile GnRH therapy (25每150 ng/kg every 2 h), administered by a subcutaneous infusion pump, is also effective for treatment of hypothalamic hypogonadism when fertility is desired.

In premenopausal women, cyclical replacement of estrogen and progesterone maintains secondary sexual characteristics and integrity of genitourinary tract mucosa and prevents premature osteoporosis (Chap. 347). Gonadotropin therapy is used for ovulation induction. Follicular growth and maturation are initiated using hMG or recombinant FSH; hCG or human luteinizing hormone (hLH) is subsequently injected to induce ovulation. As in men, pulsatile GnRH therapy can be used to treat hypothalamic causes of gonadotropin deficiency.

Nonfunctioning and Gonadotropin-Producing Pituitary Adenomas

Etiology and Prevalence

Nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas include those that secrete little or no pituitary hormones as well as tumors that produce too little hormone to result in recognizable clinical features. They are the most common type of pituitary adenoma and are usually macroadenomas at the time of diagnosis because clinical features are not apparent until tumor mass effects occur. Based on immunohistochemistry, most clinically nonfunctioning adenomas can be shown to originate from gonadotrope cells. These tumors typically produce small amounts of intact gonadotropins (usually FSH) as well as uncombined , LH , and FSH  subunits. Tumor secretion may lead to elevated  and FSH  subunits and, rarely, to increased LH  subunit levels. Some adenomas express  subunits without FSH or LH. TRH administration often induces an atypical increase of tumor-derived gonadotropins or subunits.

Presentation and Diagnosis

Clinically nonfunctioning tumors often present with optic chiasm pressure and other symptoms of local expansion or may be incidentally discovered on an MRI performed for another indication (incidentaloma). Rarely, menstrual disturbances or ovarian hyperstimulation occur in women with large tumors that produce FSH and LH. More commonly, adenoma compression of the pituitary stalk or surrounding pituitary tissue leads to attenuated LH and features of hypogonadism. PRL levels are usually slightly increased, also because of stalk compression. It is important to distinguish this circumstance from true prolactinomas, as nonfunctioning tumors do not shrink in response to treatment with dopamine agonists.

Laboratory Investigation

The goal of laboratory testing in clinically nonfunctioning tumors is to classify the type of the tumor, identify hormonal markers of tumor activity, and detect possible hypopituitarism. Free  subunit levels may be elevated in 10每15% of patients with nonfunctioning tumors. In female patients, peri- or postmenopausal basal FSH concentrations are difficult to distinguish from tumor-derived FSH elevation. Premenopausal women have cycling FSH levels, also preventing clear-cut diagnostic distinction from tumor-derived FSH. In men, gonadotropin-secreting tumors may be diagnosed because of slightly increased gonadotropins (FSH > LH) in the setting of a pituitary mass. Testosterone levels are usually low despite the normal or increased LH level, perhaps reflecting reduced LH bioactivity or the loss of normal LH pulsatility. Because this pattern of hormone test results is also seen in primary gonadal failure and, to some extent, with aging (Chap. 346), the finding of increased gonadotropins alone is insufficient for the diagnosis of a gonadotropin-secreting tumor. In the majority of patients with gonadotrope adenomas, TRH administration stimulates LH  subunit secretion; this response is not seen in normal individuals. GnRH testing, however, is not helpful for making the diagnosis. For nonfunctioning and gonadotropin-secreting tumors, the diagnosis usually rests on immunohistochemical analyses of surgically resected tumor tissue, as the mass effects of these tumors usually necessitate resection.

Although acromegaly or Cushing's syndrome usually presents with unique clinical features, clinically inapparent (silent) somatotrope or corticotrope adenomas may only be diagnosed by immunostaining of resected tumor tissue. If PRL levels are <100 g/L in a patient harboring a pituitary mass, a nonfunctioning adenoma causing pituitary stalk compression should be considered.

Treatment: Nonfunctioning and Gonadotropin-Producing Pituitary Adenomas

Asymptomatic small nonfunctioning microadenomas adenomas with no threat to vision may be followed with regular MRI and visual field testing without immediate intervention. However, for macroadenomas, transsphenoidal surgery is indicated to reduce tumor size and relieve mass effects (Fig. 339-11). Although it is not usually possible to remove all adenoma tissue surgically, vision improves in 70% of patients with preoperative visual field defects. Preexisting hypopituitarism that results from tumor mass effects may improve or resolve completely. Beginning about 6 months postoperatively, MRI scans should be performed yearly to detect tumor regrowth. Within 5每6 years after successful surgical resection, 15% of nonfunctioning tumors recur. When substantial tumor remains after transsphenoidal surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy may be indicated to prevent tumor regrowth. Radiotherapy may be deferred if no postoperative residual mass is evident.

Figure 339-11

Nonfunctioning pituitary tumors respond poorly to dopamine agonist treatment and somatostatin analogues are largely ineffective for shrinking these tumors. The selective GnRH antagonist Nal-Glu GnRH suppresses FSH hypersecretion but has no effect on adenoma size.
 
Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone

Synthesis and Secretion

TSH-secreting thyrotrope cells constitute 5% of the anterior pituitary cell population. TSH is structurally related to LH and FSH. It shares a common  subunit with these hormones but contains a specific TSH  subunit. TRH is a hypothalamic tripeptide (pyroglutamyl histidylprolinamide) that acts through a GPCR to stimulate TSH synthesis and secretion; it also stimulates the lactotrope cell to secrete PRL. TSH secretion is stimulated by TRH, whereas thyroid hormones, dopamine, somatostatin, and glucocorticoids suppress TSH by overriding TRH induction.

Thyrotrope growth and TSH secretion are both induced when negative feedback inhibition by thyroid hormones is removed. Thus, thyroid damage (including surgical thyroidectomy), radiation-induced hypothyroidism, chronic thyroiditis, and prolonged goitrogen exposure are associated with increased TSH. Long-standing untreated hypothyroidism can lead to thyrotrope hyperplasia and pituitary enlargement, which may be evident on MRI.

Action

TSH is secreted in pulses, though the excursions are modest in comparison to other pituitary hormones because of the low amplitude of the pulses and the relatively long half-life of TSH. Consequently, single determinations of TSH suffice to assess its circulating levels. TSH binds to a GPCR on thyroid follicular cells to stimulate thyroid hormone synthesis and release (Chap. 341).

TSH Deficiency

Features of central hypothyroidism due to TSH deficiency mimic those seen with primary hypothyroidism but are generally less severe. Pituitary hypothyroidism is characterized by low basal TSH levels in the setting of low free thyroid hormone. In contrast, patients with hypothyroidism of hypothalamic origin (presumably due to a lack of endogenous TRH) may exhibit normal or even slightly elevated TSH levels. The TSH produced in this circumstance appears to have reduced biologic activity because of altered glycosylation.

TRH (200 g) injected intravenously causes a two- to threefold increase in TSH (and PRL) levels within 30 min. Although TRH testing can be used to assess TSH reserve, abnormalities of the thyroid axis usually can be detected based on basal free T4 and TSH levels, and TRH testing is rarely indicated.

Thyroid-replacement therapy should be initiated after adequate adrenal function has been established. Dose adjustment is based on thyroid hormone levels and clinical parameters rather than the TSH level.

TSH-Secreting Adenomas

TSH-producing macroadenomas are rare but are often large and locally invasive when they occur. Patients usually present with thyroid goiter and hyperthyroidism, reflecting overproduction of TSH. Diagnosis is based on demonstrating elevated serum free T4 levels, inappropriately normal or high TSH secretion, and MRI evidence of a pituitary adenoma.

It is important to exclude other causes of inappropriate TSH secretion, such as resistance to thyroid hormone, an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the thyroid hormone  receptor (Chap. 341). The presence of a pituitary mass and elevated  subunit levels are suggestive of a TSH-secreting tumor. Dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia syndromes, caused by mutations in serum thyroid hormone binding proteins, are also characterized by elevated thyroid hormone levels, but with normal rather than suppressed TSH levels. Moreover, free thyroid hormone levels are normal in these disorders, most of which are familial.

Treatment: TSH-Secreting Adenomas

The initial therapeutic approach is to remove or debulk the tumor mass surgically, usually using a transsphenoidal approach. Total resection is not often achieved as most of these adenomas are large and locally invasive. Normal circulating thyroid hormone levels are achieved in about two-thirds of patients after surgery. Thyroid ablation or antithyroid drugs (methimazole and propylthiouracil) can be used to reduce thyroid hormone levels. Somatostatin analogue treatment effectively normalizes TSH and  subunit hypersecretion, shrinks the tumor mass in 50% of patients, and improves visual fields in 75% of patients; euthyroidism is restored in most patients. Because somatostatin analogues markedly suppress TSH, biochemical hypothyroidism often requires concomitant thyroid hormone replacement, which may also further control tumor growth.

Disorders of the Neurohypophysis: Introduction

The neurohypophysis, or posterior pituitary, is formed by axons that originate in large cell bodies in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. It produces two hormones: (1) arginine vasopressin (AVP), also known as antidiuretic hormone, and (2) oxytocin. AVP acts on the renal tubules to reduce water loss by concentrating the urine. Oxytocin stimulates postpartum milk letdown in response to suckling. AVP deficiency causes diabetes insipidus (DI), which is characterized by the production of large amounts of dilute urine. Excessive or inappropriate AVP production predisposes to hyponatremia if water intake is not reduced in parallel with urine output.
 
Vasopressin

Synthesis and Secretion

AVP is a nonapeptide composed of a six-member disulfide ring and a tripeptide tail (Fig. 340-1). It is synthesized via a polypeptide precursor that includes AVP, neurophysin, and copeptin, all encoded by a single gene on chromosome 20. After preliminary processing and folding, the precursor is packaged in neurosecretory vesicles, where it is transported down the axon, further processed to AVP, and stored in neurosecretory vesicles until the hormone and other components are released by exocytosis into peripheral blood.

AVP secretion is regulated primarily by the "effective" osmotic pressure of body fluids. This control is mediated by specialized hypothalamic cells known as osmoreceptors, which are extremely sensitive to small changes in the plasma concentration of sodium and certain other solutes but normally are insensitive to other solutes such as urea and glucose. The osmoreceptors appear to include inhibitory as well as stimulatory components that function in concert to form a threshold, or set point, control system. Below this threshold, plasma AVP is suppressed to levels that permit the development of a maximum water diuresis. Above it, plasma AVP rises steeply in direct proportion to plasma osmolarity, quickly reaching levels sufficient to effect a maximum antidiuresis. The absolute levels of plasma osmolarity/sodium at which minimally and maximally effective levels of plasma AVP occur, vary appreciably from person to person, apparently owing to genetic influences on the set and sensitivity of the system. However, the average threshold, or set point, for AVP release corresponds to a plasma osmolarity or sodium of about 280 mosmol/L or 135 meq/L, respectively; levels only 2每4% higher normally result in maximum antidiuresis.

Though it is relatively stable in a healthy adult, the set point of the osmoregulatory system can be lowered by pregnancy, the menstrual cycle, estrogen, and relatively large, acute reductions in blood pressure or volume. Those reductions are mediated largely by neuronal afferents that originate in transmural pressure receptors of the heart and large arteries and project via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves to the brainstem, from which postsynaptic projections ascend to the hypothalamus. These pathways maintain a tonic inhibitory tone that decreases when blood volume or pressure falls by >10每20%. This baroregulatory system is probably of minor importance in the physiology of AVP secretion because the hemodynamic changes required to effect it usually do not occur during normal activities. However, the baroregulatory system undoubtedly plays an important role in AVP secretion in patients with large, acute disturbances of hemodynamic function.

AVP secretion also can be stimulated by nausea, acute hypoglycemia, glucocorticoid deficiency, smoking, and, possibly, hyperangiotensinemia. The emetic stimuli are extremely potent since they typically elicit immediate, 50- to 100-fold increases in plasma AVP even when the nausea is transient and is not associated with vomiting or other symptoms. They appear to act via the emetic center in the medulla and can be blocked completely by treatment with antiemetics such as fluphenazine. There is no evidence that pain or other noxious stresses have any effect on AVP unless they elicit a vasovagal reaction with its associated nausea and hypotension.

Action

The most important, if not the only, physiologic action of AVP is to reduce water excretion by promoting concentration of urine. This antidiuretic effect is achieved by increasing the hydroosmotic permeability of cells that line the distal tubule and medullary collecting ducts of the kidney (Fig. 340-2). In the absence of AVP, these cells are impermeable to water and reabsorb little, if any, of the relatively large volume of dilute filtrate that enters from the proximal nephron. This results in the excretion of very large volumes (as much as 0.2 mL/kg per min) of maximally dilute urine (specific gravity and osmolarity 1.000 and 50 mosmol/L, respectively), a condition known as water diuresis. In the presence of AVP, these cells become selectively permeable to water, allowing the water to diffuse back down the osmotic gradient created by the hypertonic renal medulla. As a result, the dilute fluid passing through the tubules is concentrated and the rate of urine flow decreases. The magnitude of this effect varies in direct proportion to the plasma AVP concentration and, at maximum levels, approximates a urine flow rate as low as 0.35 mL/min and a urine osmolarity as high as 1200 mosmol/L. This action is mediated via binding to G protein每coupled V2 receptors on the serosal surface of the cell, activation of adenyl cyclase, and insertion into the luminal surface of water channels composed of a protein known as aquaporin 2 (AQP2). The V2 receptors and aquaporin 2 are encoded by genes on chromosomes Xq28 and 12q13, respectively.

Figure 340-2

 
 
 
Antidiuretic effect of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the regulation of urine volume. In a typical 70-kg adult, the kidney filters 180 L/d of plasma. Of this, 144 L (80%) is reabsorbed isosmotically in the proximal tubule and another 8 L (4每5%) is reabsorbed without solute in the descending limb of Henle's loop. The remainder is diluted to an osmolarity of 60 mmol/kg by selective reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the ascending limb. In the absence of AVP, the urine issuing from the loop passes largely unmodified through the distal tubules and collecting ducts, resulting in a maximum water diuresis. In the presence of AVP, solute-free water is reabsorbed osmotically through the principal cells of the collecting ducts, resulting in the excretion of a much smaller volume of concentrated urine. This antidiuretic effect is mediated via a G protein每coupled V2 receptor that increases intracellular cyclic AMP, thereby inducing translocation of aquaporin 2 (AQP 2) water channels into the apical membrane. The resultant increase in permeability permits an influx of water that diffuses out of the cell through AQP 3 and AQP 4 water channels on the basal-lateral surface. The net rate of flux across the cell is determined by the number of AQP 2 water channels in the apical membrane and the strength of the osmotic gradient between tubular fluid and the renal medulla. Tight junctions on the lateral surface of the cells serve to prevent unregulated water flow.
 
 

At high concentrations, AVP also causes contraction of smooth muscle in blood vessels and in the gastrointestinal tract, induces glycogenolysis in the liver, and potentiates adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release by corticotropin-releasing factor. These effects are mediated by V1a or V1b receptors that are coupled to phospholipase C. Their role, if any, in human physiology/pathophysiology is uncertain.

Metabolism

AVP distributes rapidly into a space roughly equal to the extracellular fluid volume. It is cleared irreversibly with a t1/2 of 10每30 minutes. Most AVP clearance is due to degradation in the liver and kidneys. During pregnancy, the metabolic clearance of AVP is increased three- to fourfold due to placental production of an N-terminal peptidase.
 
Thirst

Because AVP cannot reduce water loss below a certain minimum level obligated by urinary solute load and evaporation from skin and lungs, a mechanism for ensuring adequate intake is essential for preventing dehydration. This vital function is performed by the thirst mechanism. Like AVP, thirst is regulated primarily by an osmostat that is situated in the anteromedial hypothalamus and is able to detect very small changes in the plasma concentration of sodium and certain other effective solutes. The thirst osmostat appears to be "set" about 5% higher than the AVP osmostat. This arrangement ensures that thirst, polydipsia, and dilution of body fluids do not occur until plasma osmolarity/sodium start to exceed the defensive capacity of the antidiuretic mechanism.
 
Oxytocin

Oxytocin is also a nonapeptide, and it differs from AVP only at positions 3 and 8 (Fig. 340-1). However, it has relatively little antidiuretic effect and seems to act mainly on mammary ducts to facilitate milk letdown during nursing. It also may help initiate or facilitate labor by stimulating contraction of uterine smooth muscle, but it is not clear if this action is physiologic or necessary for normal delivery.
 
Deficiencies of Vasopressin Secretion and Action

Diabetes Insipidus

Clinical Characteristics

Decreased secretion or action of AVP usually manifests as diabetes insipidus, a syndrome characterized by the production of abnormally large volumes of dilute urine. The 24-hour urine volume is >50 mL/kg body weight, and the osmolarity is <300 mosmol/L. The polyuria produces symptoms of urinary frequency, enuresis, and/or nocturia, which may disturb sleep and cause mild daytime fatigue or somnolence. It also results in a slight rise in plasma osmolarity that stimulates thirst and a commensurate increase in fluid intake (polydipsia). Overt clinical signs of dehydration are uncommon unless fluid intake is impaired.

Etiology

Deficient secretion of AVP can be primary or secondary. The primary form usually results from agenesis or irreversible destruction of the neurohypophysis and is referred to variously as neurohypophyseal DI, pituitary DI, or central DI. It can be caused by a variety of congenital, acquired, or genetic disorders, but in about one-half of all adult patients it is idiopathic (Table 340-1). The surgically induced forms of pituitary DI usually appear within 24 hours and then go through a 2- to 3-week interim period of inappropriate antidiuresis, after which they may or may not recur. The genetic form usually is transmitted in an autosomal dominant mode and is caused by diverse mutations in the coding region of the AVP每neurophysin II (or AVP-NPII) gene. All the mutations alter one or more amino acids known to be critical for correct folding of the prohormone, thus interfering with its processing and trafficking through the endoplasmic reticulum. The AVP deficiency and DI develop gradually several months to years after birth, progressing from partial to severe and permanent DI. They appear to result from accumulation of misfolded mutant precursor followed by selective degeneration of AVP-producing magnocellular neurons. An autosomal recessive form due to an inactivating mutation in the AVP portion of the gene, an X-linked recessive form due to an unidentified gene on Xq28, and an autosomal recessive form due to mutations of the WFS 1 gene responsible for Wolfram's syndrome [diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and neural deafness (DIDMOAD)] have also been described. A primary deficiency of plasma AVP also can result from increased metabolism by an N-terminal aminopeptidase produced by the placenta. It is referred to as gestational DI since the signs and symptoms manifest during pregnancy and usually remit several weeks after delivery.

Secondary deficiencies of AVP result from inhibition of secretion by excessive intake of fluids. They are referred to as primary polydipsia and can be divided into three subcategories. One of them, dipsogenic DI, is characterized by inappropriate thirst caused by a reduction in the set of the osmoregulatory mechanism. It sometimes occurs in association with multifocal diseases of the brain such as neurosarcoid, tuberculous meningitis, and multiple sclerosis but is often idiopathic. The second subtype, psychogenic polydipsia, is not associated with thirst, and the polydipsia seems to be a feature of psychosis or obsessive compulsive disorder. The third subtype, iatrogenic polydipsia, results from recommendations to increase fluid intake for its presumed health benefits.

Primary deficiencies in the antidiuretic action of AVP result in nephrogenic DI (Table 340-1). They can be genetic, acquired, or drug induced. The genetic form usually is transmitted in a semirecessive X-linked manner and is caused by mutations in the coding region of the V2 receptor gene that impair trafficking and/or ligand binding of the mutant receptor. Autosomal recessive or dominant forms are caused by AQP2 gene mutations that result in complete or partial defects in trafficking and function of the water channels in distal and collecting tubules of the kidney.

Secondary deficiencies in the antidiuretic response to AVP result from polyuria per se. They are caused by washout of the medullary concentration gradient and/or suppression of aquaporin function. They usually resolve 24每48 hours after the polyuria is corrected but can complicate interpretation of some acute tests used for differential diagnosis.

Pathophysiology

When the secretion or action of AVP falls below 80每85% of normal, urine concentration ceases and the rate of urine output rises to symptomatic levels. If the defect is due to pituitary, gestational, or nephrogenic DI, the polyuria results in a small (1每2%) decrease in body water and a commensurate increase in plasma osmolarity and sodium concentration that stimulate thirst and a compensatory increase in water intake. As a result, hypernatremia and otherovert physical or laboratory signs of dehydration do not develop unless the patient also has a defect in thirstor fails to drink for some other reason.

The severity of the antidiuretic defect varies markedly from patient to patient. In some, the deficiencies in AVP secretion or action are so severe that even an intense stimulus such as nausea or severe dehydration does not raise plasma AVP enough to concentrate the urine. In others, the deficiency is incomplete, and a modest stimulus such as a few hours of fluid deprivation, smoking, or a vasovagal reaction increases plasma AVP sufficiently to raise urine osmolarity as high as 800 mosmol/L. The maximum achieved is usually less than normal, but that is the case largely because maximal concentrating capacity is temporarily impaired by chronic polyuria.

In primary polydipsia, the pathogenesis of the polydipsia and polyuria is the reverse of that in pituitary, nephrogenic, and gestational DI. Thus, the excessive intake of fluids slightly increases body water, thereby reducing plasma osmolarity, AVP secretion, and urinary concentration. The latter results in a compensatory increase in urinary free-water excretion that varies in direct proportion to intake. Therefore, hyponatremia or clinically appreciable overhydration is uncommon unless the polydipsia is very severe or the compensatory water diuresis is impaired by a drug or disease that stimulates or mimics endogenous AVP.

In the dipsogenic form of primary polydipsia, fluid intake is excessive because the osmotic threshold for thirst appears to be reset to the left, often well below that for AVP release. When deprived of fluids or subjected to another acute osmotic or nonosmotic stimulus, these individuals invariably increase plasma AVP normally, but the resultant increase in urine concentration is usually subnormal because the individuals' renal capacities to concentrate the urine also are blunted temporarily by chronic polyuria. Thus, the maximum level of urine osmolarity achieved is usually indistinguishable from that in patients with partial pituitary, partial gestational, or partial nephrogenic DI. Patients with psychogenic or iatrogenic polydipsia respond similarly to fluid restriction but do not complain of thirst and usually offer other explanations for their high fluid intake.

Differential Diagnosis

When symptoms of urinary frequency, enuresis, nocturia, and/or persistent thirst are present, the possibility of DI should be evaluated after excluding glucosuria by collecting a 24-hour urine on ad libitum fluid intake. If the volume exceeds 50 mL/kg per day (3500 mL in a 70-kg male) and the osmolarity is >300 mosmol/L, DI is confirmed and the patient should be evaluated further to determine the type.

In differentiating among the various types of DI, the history alone may be sufficient if it reveals a likely antecedent such as pituitary surgery. Usually, however, that type of indicator is absent, ambiguous, or misleading and other approaches are needed. Except in the rare patient with hypertonic dehydration under basal conditions, differentiation should begin with a fluid deprivation test. It can be performed on an outpatient basis if the necessary staff and facilities are available. To minimize patient discomfort, avoid excessive dehydration, and maximize the information obtained, the test should be started in the morning and continued with hourly monitoring of body weight, plasma osmolarity and/or sodium concentration, urine volume, and urine osmolarity until either of two endpoints is reached. If fluid deprivation does not result in urine concentration (osmolarity >300 mosmol/L, specific gravity >1.010) before body weight decreases by 5% or plasma osmolarity/sodium rise above the upper limit of normal, the patient has severe pituitary or severe nephrogenic DI. These disorders usually can be distinguished by administering desmopressin (0.03 g/kg SC or IV) and repeating the measurement of urine osmolarity 1每2 hours later. An increase of >50% indicates severe pituitary DI, whereas a smaller or absent response is strongly suggestive of nephrogenic DI.

Conversely, if fluid deprivation results in concentration of the urine, severe defects in AVP secretion and action are excluded and the question becomes whether the patient has partial pituitary DI, partial nephrogenic DI, or primary polydipsia. The maximum levels of urine osmolarity achieved before and after desmopressin injection are of no help in this regard because the values in the three groups vary widely and overlap owing to impairment of renal concentrating capacity caused by polyuria per se. Therefore, another approach is needed to differentiate among them. The easiest and least expensive method is to measure plasma AVP before and during the fluid deprivation test and analyze the results in relation to the concurrent plasma and urine osmolarity (Fig. 340-3). This approach invariably differentiates partial nephrogenic DI from partial pituitary DI and primary polydipsia. It also differentiates partial pituitary DI from primary polydipsia if plasma osmolarity and/or sodium are clearly above the normal range when the hormone is measured. However, the requisite level of hypertonic dehydration may be difficult to produce by fluid deprivation alone when urine concentration occurs. Therefore, it is usually necessary to continue the fluid deprivation and infuse hypertonic (3%) saline at a rate of 0.1 mL/kg per min until plasma osmolarity/sodium measured every 20 to 30 minutes reach or slightly exceed the upper limit of normal. At that point the plasma osmolarity/sodium, which is usually reached in 30 to 90 minutes, the measurement of plasma AVP should be repeated and the result related to plasma osmolarity/sodium is as before.

An alternative method of differential diagnosis is MRI of the pituitary and hypothalamus. In most healthy adults and children, the posterior pituitary emits a hyperintense signal in T1-weighted midsagittal images. This "bright spot" is almost always present in patients with primary polydipsia but is invariably absent or abnormally small in patients with pituitary DI. It is usually also small or absent in nephrogenic DI presumably because of high secretion and turnover of AVP. Thus, a normal bright spot virtually excludes pituitary DI, argues against nephrogenic DI, and strongly suggests primary polydipsia. Lack of the bright spot is less helpful, however, because it is absent not only in pituitary and nephrogenic DI but also in some healthy adults and patients with empty sella who do not have DI or AVP deficiency.

The other way to distinguish among the three basic types of DI is a closely monitored trial of desmopressin therapy.

Treatment: Diabetes Insipidus

The signs and symptoms of uncomplicated pituitary DI can be eliminated completely by treatment with desmopressin (DDAVP), a synthetic analogue of AVP (Fig. 340-1). DDAVP acts selectively at V2 receptors to increase urine concentration and decrease urine flow in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 340-4). It is also more resistant to degradation than is AVP and has a three- to fourfold longer duration of action. Desmopressin can be given by IV or SC injection, nasal inhalation, or oral tablet. The doses required to control pituitary DI completely vary widely, depending on the patient and the route of administration. However, they usually range from 1每2 g qd or bid by injection, 10每20 g bid or tid by nasal spray, or 100每400 g bid or tid orally. The onset of action is rapid, ranging from as little as 15 minutes after injection to 60 minutes after oral administration. When given in doses sufficient to normalize urinary osmolarity and flow completely, desmopressin produces a slight (1每3%) increase in total body water and a commensurate decrease in plasma osmolarity and sodium concentration that rapidly eliminates thirst and polydipsia. Consequently, water balance is maintained and hyponatremia does not develop unless the osmoregulation of thirst is also impaired or fluid intake is excessive for another reason such as a misconception about the need to prevent dehydration. Fortunately, thirst abnormalities are rare in pituitary DI, and other motivations to drink excessively usually can be eliminated by patient education. Therefore, desmopressin usually can be given safely in doses sufficient to normalize urine output completely, thereby avoiding the inconvenience and discomfort of intermittent escape otherwise needed to prevent water intoxication.

Figure 340-4

Note that treatment rapidly reduces thirst and fluid intake as well as urine output to normal, with only a slight increase in body water (weight) and a decrease in plasma osmolarity/sodium. [From P Felig, L Frohman (eds): Endocrinology and Metabolism, 4th ed. New York, McGraw-Hill, 2001, with permission.]
 
 

Primary polydipsia cannot be treated safely with desmopressin or any other antidiuretic drug because eliminating the polyuria does not eliminate the urge to drink. Therefore, it produces hyponatremia and/or other signs of water intoxication, usually within 24 to 48 hours if urine output is normalized completely. Patient education may eliminate iatrogenic polydipsia, but it is largely ineffective in psychogenic or dipsogenic DI. In these patients, the only help currently available is to try to prevent water intoxication by warning about the use of drugs that can impair urinary free-water excretion directly or indirectly.

The polyuria and polydipsia of nephrogenic DI are not affected by treatment with standard doses of desmopressin. If resistance is partial, it may be overcome by tenfold higher doses, but this treatment is too expensive and inconvenient to be useful chronically. However, treatment with conventional doses of a thiazide diuretic and/or amiloride in conjunction with a low-sodium diet and a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor (e.g., indomethacin) usually reduces the polyuria and polydipsia by 30每70% and may eliminate them completely in some patients. Side effects such as hypokalemia and gastric irritation can be minimized by the use of amiloride or potassium supplements and by taking medications with meals.

Adipsic Hypernatremia

Clinical Characteristics

A defect in the thirst mechanism results in adipsic hypernatremia, a syndrome characterized by chronic or recurrent hypertonic dehydration. The hypernatremia varies widely in severity and usually is associated with signs of hypovolemia such as tachycardia, postural hypotension, azotemia, hyperuricemia, and hypokalemia. Muscle weakness, pain, rhabdomyolysis, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and acute renal failure may also occur. DI usually does not exist at presentation but may develop during rehydration.

Etiology

Deficient thirst is usually due to hypogenesis or destruction of the osmoreceptors in the anterior hypothalamus. Because of their proximity, the osmoreceptors that regulate AVP secretion also are usually impaired. These defects can result from various congenital malformations of midline brain structures or may be acquired due to diseases such as occlusions of the anterior communicating artery, primary or metastatic tumors in the hypothalamus, head trauma, surgery, granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis and histiocytosis, AIDS, and cytomegalovirus encephalitis.

Pathophysiology

A deficiency of thirst results in a failure to drink enough water to replenish obligatory renal and extrarenal losses, causing hypertonic dehydration. In most patients, the response of AVP to osmotic stimulation is also deficient (Fig. 340-5). If the deficiency is partial, it may not be clinically apparent at first because the hypertonicity and hypovolemia are severe enough to stimulate the release of AVP in the small amounts necessary to concentrate the urine. However, when the hypertonicity and hypovolemia are reduced, plasma AVP falls and polyuria develop, often before the dehydration is corrected fully. Patients with a complete lack of osmoregulation do not develop DI at any level of hydration because they cannot osmotically suppress or stimulate AVP secretion. Therefore, a hyponatremic syndrome indistinguisable from inappropriate antidiuresis may develop if rehydration is excessive. In most patients, the neurohypophysis and the AVP response to hemodynamic or emetic stimuli are normal. In a few, however, the neurohypophysis is also destroyed, resulting in a combination of chronic pituitary DI and hypodipsia that is particularly difficult to manage.

Each line depicts schematically the relationship of plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) to plasma osmolarity during water loading and/or infusion of 3% saline in a patient with either AH (open symbols) or SIAD (closed symbols). The shaded area indicates the normal range of the relationship. The horizontal broken line indicates the plasma AVP level below which the hormone is undetectable and urinary concentration usually does not occur. Lines P and T represent patients with a selective deficiency in the osmoregulation of thirst and AVP that is either partial () or total (). In the latter, plasma AVP does not change in response to increases or decreases in plasma osmolarity but remains within a range sufficient to concentrate the urine even if overhydration produces hypotonic hyponatremia. In contrast, if the osmoregulatory deficiency is partial (), rehydration of the patient suppresses plasma AVP to levels that result in urinary dilution and polyuria before plasma osmolarity and sodium are reduced to normal. Lines a每d represent different defects in the osmoregulation of plasma AVP observed in patients with SIAD. In a (), plasma AVP is markedly elevated and fluctuates widely without relation to changes in plasma osmolarity, indicating complete loss of osmoregulation. In b (), plasma AVP remains fixed at a slightly elevated level until plasma osmolarity reaches the normal range, at which point it begins to rise appropriately, indicating a selective defect in the inhibitory component of the osmoregulatory mechanism. In c (), plasma AVP rises in close correlation with plasma osmolarity before the latter reaches the normal range, indicating downward resetting of the osmostat. In d (), plasma AVP appears to be osmoregulated normally, suggesting that the inappropriate antidiuresis is caused by some other abnormality.
 
 

Differential Diagnosis

Adipsic hypernatremia usually can be distinguished clinically from other causes of inadequate fluid intake (e.g., coma, paralysis, restraints, absence of fresh water) that can also result in hypertonic dehydration. Previous episodes and/or denial of thirst and failure to drink spontaneously when the patient is conscious, unrestrained, and hypernatremic are virtually diagnostic of adipsia. The hypernatremia caused by excessive oral or intravenous intake of sodium can also be distinguished by the history and/or physical examination and laboratory signs of volume expansion rather than contraction.

Adipsic hypernatremia should be treated by administering water orally if the patient is alert and cooperative or by using hypotonic fluids (0.45% saline or 5% dextrose and water) via IV if the patient is not. The amount of free water in liters required to correct the deficit (FW) can be estimated from body weight in kg (BW) and the serum sodium concentration in mmol/L (SNa) by the formula FW = 0.5BW x [(SNa 每 140)/140]. If serum glucose (SGlu) is elevated, the measured SNa should be corrected (SNa*) by the formula SNa* = SNa + [(SGlu 每 90)/36]. This amount plus an allowance for continuing insensible and urinary losses should be given over a 24- to 48-hour period. Close monitoring of serum sodium as well as fluid intake and urinary output is essential because, depending on the extent of osmoreceptor deficiency (Fig. 340-5), some patients will develop AVP-deficient DI, requiring desmopressin therapy to complete rehydration; others will develop hyponatremia and a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD)-like picture if overhydrated. If hyperglycemia and/or hypokalemia are present, insulin and/or potassium supplements should be given with the expectation that both can be discontinued soon after rehydration is complete. Plasma urea/creatinine should be monitored closely for signs of acute renal failure.

Once the patient has been rehydrated, an MRI of the brain and tests of anterior pituitary function should be performed to look for the cause and collateral defects in other hypothalamic functions. A long-term management plan to prevent or minimize recurrence of the fluid and electrolyte imbalance also should be developed. This should include a practical method that can be used to regulate fluid intake in accordance with day-to-day variations in water balance. The most effective way to do this is to prescribe desmopressin to control DI if it is present and teach the patient how to adjust daily fluid intake in accordance with day-to-day changes in body weight or serum sodium as determined by home monitoring analyzers. Prescribing a constant fluid intake is ineffective and potentially dangerous because it does not take into account the large, uncontrolled variations in insensible loss that inevitably result from changes in ambient temperature and physical activity.

(see also Chap. 45)

Clinical Characteristics

Excessive secretion or action of AVP results in the production of decreased volumes of more highly concentrated urine. If not accompanied by a commensurate reduction in fluid intake or an increase in insensible loss, the reduction in urine output results in excess water retention with expansion and dilution of all body fluids. In some patients, excessive intake results from inappropriate thirst. If the hyponatremia develops gradually or has been present for more than a few days, it may be largely asymptomatic. However, if it develops acutely, it usually is accompanied by symptoms and signs of water intoxication that may include mild headache, confusion, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, coma, and convulsions. Severe hyponatremia may be lethal. Other clinical signs and symptoms vary greatly, depending on the pathogenesis of the defect in antidiuretic function.

Etiology

Hyponatremia and impaired urinary dilution can be caused by either a primary or a secondary defect in the regulation of AVP secretion or action. The primary forms are generally referred to as the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis. They have many different causes, including ectopic production of AVP by lung cancer or other neoplasms; eutopic release by various diseases or drugs; and exogenous administration of AVP, desmopressin, or large doses of oxytocin (Table 340-2). The ectopic forms result from abnormal expression of the AVP-NPII gene by primary or metastatic malignancies. The eutopic forms occur most often in patients with acute infections or strokes but have also been associated with many other neurologic diseases and injuries. In this case, the SIAD is usually self-limited and remits spontaneously within 2每3 weeks, but about 10% of cases are chronic. The mechanisms by which these diseases disrupt osmoregulation are not known. The defect in osmoregulation can take any of four distinct forms (Fig. 340-5). In one of the most common (reset osmostat), AVP secretion remains fully responsive to changes in plasma osmolarity/sodium but the threshold, or set point, of the osmoregulatory system is abnormally low. These patients differ from those with the other types of osmoregulatory defect in that they are able to maximally suppress plasma AVP and dilute their urine if their fluid intake is high enough to reduce their plasma osmolarity/sodium to the new set point. Another, smaller subgroup (10% of the total) has inappropriate antidiuresis without a demonstrable defect in the osmoregulation of plasma AVP (Fig. 340-5). In some of them, all young boys, the inappropriate antidiuresis has been traced to a constitutively activating mutation of the V2 receptor gene. This unusual variant may be referred to as familial nephrogenic SIAD to distinguish it from other possible causes of the syndrome.

The secondary forms of osmotically inappropriate antidiuresis also have multiple causes. They usually are subdivided into three types, depending on the nature of the abnormal stimulus and the state of extracellular fluid volume. Type I occurs in sodium-retaining, edema-forming states such as congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and nephrosis. It is associated with markedly excessive retention of water and sodium that is thought to be stimulated by a large reduction in "effective" blood volume caused by low cardiac output and/or redistribution of plasma from the intravascular space to the interstitial space. Type II occurs in sodium-depleted states such as severe gastroenteritis, diuretic abuse, and mineralocorticoid deficiency. It is due to stimulation of AVP by a large reduction in blood volume and/or pressure. In both types, the increased AVP secretion appears to be due to downward resetting of the osmostat. Type III is due to nonosmotic, nonhemodynamic AVP stimuli such as nausea or isolated glucocorticoid deficiency that produce a form of euvolemic hyponatremia similar to SIAD (Table 340-3). They are differentiated because the cause of excess AVP secretion in type III can be corrected quickly and completely by treatments (antiemetics or glucocorticoids) that are not useful in SIAD.

Pathophysiology

When osmotic suppression of antidiuresis is impaired for any reason, retention of water and dilution of body fluids occur only if intake exceeds the rate of obligatory and insensible and urinary losses. The excess water intake sometimes is due to an associated defect in the osmoregulation of thirst (dipsogenic) but also can be psychogenic or iatrogenic, including IV administration of hypotonic fluids.

In SIAD, the excessive retention of water expands extracellular and intracellular volume, increases glomerular filtration and atrial natriuretic hormone, suppresses plasma renin activity, and increases urinary sodium excretion. This natriuresis reduces total body sodium, and this serves to counteract the extracellular hypervolemia but aggravates the hyponatremia. The osmotically driven increase in intracellular volume results in swelling of brain cells and increases intracranial pressure; this is probably responsible for the symptoms of acute water intoxication. Within a few days, this swelling may be counteracted by inactivation or elimination of intracellular solutes, resulting in the remission of symptoms even though the hyponatremia persists. The pathophysiology of type III (euvolemic) hyponatremia is probably similar to that of SIAD.

In type I (hypervolemic) or type II (hypovolemic) hyponatremia, the antidiuretic effect of hemodynamically induced AVP release is enhanced by decreased distal delivery of glomerular filtrate that results from increased reabsorption of sodium in proximal nephrons. If the marked reduction in urine output is not associated with a commensurate reduction in water intake or an increase in insensible loss, body fluids are expanded and diluted, resulting in hyponatremia. Unlike SIAD, however, glomerular filtration is reduced and plasma renin activity and aldosterone are elevated due to either effective hypovolemia (type I) or absolute hypovolemia (type II). Thus, urinary sodium excretion is low (unless sodium reabsorption is impaired by a diuretic), and the hyponatremia is usually accompanied by hypokalemia, azotemia, and hyperuricemia. The sodium retention is an appropriate compensatory response to severe volume and sodium depletion in type II but is inappropriate and deleterious in type I since body sodium and extracellular volume are already markedly increased, as evidenced by the presence of generalized edema.

Differential Diagnosis

SIAD is a diagnosis of exclusion that usually can be made from the history, physical examination, and basic laboratory data. The possibility that hyponatremia is due to an osmotically driven shift of water from the intracellular space to the extracellular space can be excluded if plasma glucose is not high enough to account for the hyponatremia [serum sodium decreases 1 meq/L for each rise in glucose of 2 mmol/L (36 mg/dL)] and/or plasma osmolarity is reduced in proportion to sodium (each decrease in serum sodium of 1 meq/L should reduce plasma osmolarity by 2 mosmol/L). The type of hypotonic hyponatremia can then be determined by standard clinical indicators of the extracellular fluid volume (Table 340-3). If these findings are ambiguous or contradictory, measuring the rate of urinary sodium excretion or plasma renin activity may be helpful provided that the hyponatremia is not in the recovery phase or due to a primary defect in renal conservation of sodium, diuretic abuse, or hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. The latter may be suspected if serum potassium is elevated instead of low as it usually is in types I and II hyponatremia. Measurements of plasma AVP are currently of no value in differentiating among the three types of hyponatremia since the abnormalities are similar. In patients who fulfill the clinical criteria for type III (euvolemic) hyponatremia, morning plasma cortisol should also be measured to exclude secondary adrenal insufficiency. If it is normal and there is no history of nausea/vomiting, the diagnosis of SIAD is confirmed and a careful search for occult lung cancer or other common causes of the syndrome (Table 340-2) should be undertaken. If an activating mutation of the V2 receptor gene is suspected, plasma AVP should be measured while the hyponatremia and antidiuresis are present. If it is undetectable, DNA should be collected for analysis of the V2 receptor gene.

Treatment: Hyponatremia

The management of hyponatremia differs depending not only on the type but also on the severity and duration of symptoms. In a patient with SIAD and few symptoms, the objective is to reduce body water gradually by restricting total fluid intake to less than the sum of urinary and insensible losses. Because the water derived from food (300每700 mL/d) usually approximates basal insensible losses in adults, total discretionary intake (all liquids) should be at least 500 mL less than urinary output. If achievable, this usually reduces body water and increases serum sodium by about 1每2% per day. If the symptoms or signs of water intoxication are more severe, the hyponatremia can be corrected more rapidly by supplementing the fluid restriction with IV infusion of hypertonic (3%) saline. This treatment also has the advantage of correcting the sodium deficiency that is partly responsible for the hyponatremia in SIAD and produces a solute diuresis that serves to remove some of the excess water. However, if plasma sodium is raised too rapidly or too much and the hyponatremia has been present for >24每48 hours, it also has the potential to produce central pontine myelinolysis, an acute, potentially fatal neurologic syndrome characterized by quadriparesis, ataxia, and abnormal extraocular movements. The risk of this complication can be minimized by observing several precautions: 3% saline should be infused at a rate 0.05 mL/kg body weight per min; the effect should be monitored continuously by STAT measurements of serum sodium at least once every 2 hours; and the infusion should be stopped as soon as serum sodium increases by 12 mmol/L or to 130 mmol/L, whichever comes first. Urinary output should be monitored continuously since SIAD can remit spontaneously at any time, resulting in an acute water diuresis that greatly accelerates the rate of rise in serum sodium produced by fluid restriction and 3% saline infusion.

In chronic SIAD, the hyponatremia can be corrected by treatment with demeclocycline, 150每300 mg PO tid or gid, or fludrocortisone, 0.05每0.2 mg PO bid. The effect of the demeclocycline manifests in 7每14 days and is due to production of a reversible form of nephrogenic DI. Potential side effects include phototoxicity and azotemia. The effect of fludrocortisone also requires 1每2 weeks and is partly due to increased retention of sodium and possibly inhibition of thirst. It also increases urinary potassium excretion, which may require replacement through dietary adjustments or supplements and may induce hypertension, occasionally necessitating discontinuation of the treatment.

Nonpeptide AVP antagonists that block the antidiuretic effect of AVP have been used experimentally to treat SIAD. They produce a dose-dependent increase in urinary free-water excretion, that, if combined with a modest restriction of fluid intake, reduces body water and corrects the hyponatremia. The antagonists appear to have no adverse side effects, but, like hypertonic saline, they probably carry the risk of inducing osmotic demyelinization if the hyponatremia is corrected too rapidly. One of them, a combined V2/V1a antagonist (Conivaptan), has been approved for short-term in-hospital IV treatment of SIAD and the hyponatremia of congestive heart failure. It is a substrate and inhibitor of cytochrome P450 and should not be used in conjunction with other drugs metabolized by these pathways. Other V2 receptor antagonists are currently in phase III trials.

In type I hyponatremia, fluid restriction is also appropriate and somewhat effective if it can be maintained. However, infusion of hypertonic saline is contraindicated because it further increases total body sodium and edema and may precipitate cardiovascular decompensation. Preliminary studies with antagonists of V2 receptors indicate that they are almost as effective in type I hyponatremia as they are in SIAD.

In type II hyponatremia, the defect in AVP secretion and water balance usually can be corrected easily and quickly by stopping the loss of sodium and water and/or replacing the deficits by mouth or IV infusion of normal or hypertonic saline. As with the treatment of other forms of hyponatremia, care must be taken to ensure that plasma sodium does not increase too rapidly. Fluid restriction and administration of AVP antagonists are contraindicated in type II as they would only aggravate the underlying volume depletion and could result in hemodynamic collapse.

In euvolemic hyponatremia due to protracted nausea and vomiting or isolated glucocorticoid deficiency (type III), all abnormalities can be corrected quickly and completely by giving an antiemetic or stress doses of hydrocortisone. As with other treatments, care must be taken to ensure that serum sodium does not rise too quickly or too far.

Global Perspectives

The incidence, clinical characteristics, etiology, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and treatments of fluid and electrolyte disorders in tropical and nonindustrialized countries differ in some respects from those in the United States and other industrialized parts of the world. Hyponatremia, for example, appears to be more common and is more likely to be due to infectious diseases such as cholera, shigellosis, and other diarrheal disorders. In these circumstances, hyponatremia is probably due to gastrointestinal losses of salt and water (hypovolemia type II), but other abnormalities, including undefined infectious toxins, also may contribute. The causes of DI are similar worldwide except that malaria and venoms from snake or insect bites are much more common.

 Chapter 341. Disorders of the Thyroid Gland >
 

Disorders of the Thyroid Gland: Introduction

The thyroid gland produces two related hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) (Fig. 341-1). Acting through thyroid hormone receptors  and , these hormones play a critical role in cell differentiation during development and help maintain thermogenic and metabolic homeostasis in the adult. Autoimmune disorders of the thyroid gland can stimulate overproduction of thyroid hormones (thyrotoxicosis) or cause glandular destruction and hormone deficiency (hypothyroidism). In addition, benign nodules and various forms of thyroid cancer are relatively common and amenable to detection by physical examination.

Figure 341-1 Structures of Thyroid Hormones.

 
 
 
Thyroxine (T4) contains four iodine atoms. Deiodination leads to production of the potent hormone triiodothyronine (T3), or the inactive hormone reverse T3.
 
 
 
Anatomy and Development

The thyroid (Greek thyreos, shield, plus eidos, form) consists of two lobes connected by an isthmus. It is located anterior to the trachea between the cricoid cartilage and the suprasternal notch. The normal thyroid is 12每20 g in size, highly vascular, and soft in consistency. Four parathyroid glands, which produce parathyroid hormone (Chap. 353), are located posterior to each pole of the thyroid. The recurrent laryngeal nerves traverse the lateral borders of the thyroid gland and must be identified during thyroid surgery to avoid injury and vocal cord paralysis.

The thyroid gland develops from the floor of the primitive pharynx during the third week of gestation. The developing gland migrates along the thyroglossal duct to reach its final location in the neck. This feature accounts for the rare ectopic location of thyroid tissue at the base of the tongue (lingual thyroid) as well as the occurrence of thyroglossal duct cysts along this developmental tract. Thyroid hormone synthesis normally begins at about 11 weeks' gestation.

Neural crest derivatives from the ultimobranchial body give rise to thyroid medullary C cells that produce calcitonin, a calcium-lowering hormone. The C cells are interspersed throughout the thyroid gland, although their density is greatest in the juncture of the upper one-third and lower two-thirds of the gland. Calcitonin plays a minimal role in calcium homeostasis in humans but the C-cells are important because of their involvement in medullary thyroid cancer.

Thyroid gland development is orchestrated by the coordinated expression of several developmental transcription factors. Thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1, TTF-2, and paired homeobox-8 (PAX-8) are expressed selectively, but not exclusively, in the thyroid gland. In combination, they dictate thyroid cell development and the induction of thyroid-specific genes such as thyroglobulin (Tg), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), the sodium iodide symporter (Na+/I, NIS), and the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSH-R). Mutations in these developmental transcription factors or their downstream target genes are rare causes of thyroid agenesis or dyshormonogenesis, though the causes of most forms of congenital hypothyroidism remain unknown (Table 341-1). Because congenital hypothyroidism occurs in approximately 1 in 4000 newborns, neonatal screening is now performed in most industrialized countries (see below). Transplacental passage of maternal thyroid hormone occurs before the fetal thyroid gland begins to function and provides partial hormone support to a fetus with congenital hypothyroidism. Early thyroid hormone replacement in newborns with congenital hypothyroidism prevents potentially severe developmental abnormalities.

The thyroid gland consists of numerous spherical follicles composed of thyroid follicular cells that surround secreted colloid, a proteinaceous fluid containing large amounts of thyroglobulin, the protein precursor of thyroid hormones (Fig. 341-2). The thyroid follicular cells are polarized〞the basolateral surface is apposed to the bloodstream and an apical surface faces the follicular lumen. Increased demand for thyroid hormone is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which binds to its receptor on the basolateral surface of the follicular cells, leading to Tg reabsorption from the follicular lumen, proteolysis within the cytoplasm, yielding thyroid hormones for secretion into the bloodstream.

Regulation of the Thyroid Axis

TSH, secreted by the thyrotrope cells of the anterior pituitary, plays a pivotal role in control of the thyroid axis and serves as the most useful physiologic marker of thyroid hormone action. TSH is a 31-kDa hormone composed of  and  subunits; the  subunit is common to the other glycoprotein hormones [luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)], whereas the TSH  subunit is unique to TSH. The extent and nature of carbohydrate modification are modulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation and influence the biologic activity of the hormone.

The thyroid axis is a classic example of an endocrine feedback loop. Hypothalamic TRH stimulates pituitary production of TSH, which, in turn, stimulates thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion. Thyroid hormones, acting predominantly through thyroid hormone receptor 2 (TR2), feed back to inhibit TRH and TSH production (Fig. 341-2). The "set-point" in this axis is established by TSH. TRH is the major positive regulator of TSH synthesis and secretion. Peak TSH secretion occurs 15 min after administration of exogenous TRH. Dopamine, glucocorticoids, and somatostatin suppress TSH but are not of major physiologic importance except when these agents are administered in pharmacologic doses. Reduced levels of thyroid hormone increase basal TSH production and enhance TRH-mediated stimulation of TSH. High thyroid hormone levels rapidly and directly suppress TSH gene expression secretion and inhibit TRH stimulation of TSH, indicating that thyroid hormones are the dominant regulator of TSH production. Like other pituitary hormones, TSH is released in a pulsatile manner and exhibits a diurnal rhythm; its highest levels occur at night. However, these TSH excursions are modest in comparison to those of other pituitary hormones, in part, because TSH has a relatively long plasma half-life (50 minutes). Consequently, single measurements of TSH are adequate for assessing its circulating level. TSH is measured using immunoradiometric assays that are highly sensitive and specific. These assays readily distinguish between normal and suppressed TSH values; thus, TSH can be used for the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism (low TSH) as well as hypothyroidism (high TSH).
 
Thyroid Hormone Synthesis, Metabolism, and Action

Thyroid Hormone Synthesis

Thyroid hormones are derived from Tg, a large iodinated glycoprotein. After secretion into the thyroid follicle, Tg is iodinated on tyrosine residues that are subsequently coupled via an ether linkage. Reuptake of Tg into the thyroid follicular cell allows proteolysis and the release of newly synthesized T4 and T3.

Iodine Metabolism and Transport

Iodide uptake is a critical first step in thyroid hormone synthesis. Ingested iodine is bound to serum proteins, particularly albumin. Unbound iodine is excreted in the urine. The thyroid gland extracts iodine from the circulation in a highly efficient manner. For example, 10每25% of radioactive tracer (e.g., 123I) is taken up by the normal thyroid gland over 24 hours; this value can rise to 70每90% in Graves' disease. Iodide uptake is mediated by NIS, which is expressed at the basolateral membrane of thyroid follicular cells. NIS is most highly expressed in the thyroid gland, but low levels are present in the salivary glands, lactating breast, and placenta. The iodide transport mechanism is highly regulated, allowing adaptation to variations in dietary supply. Low iodine levels increase the amount of NIS and stimulate uptake, whereas high iodine levels suppress NIS expression and uptake. The selective expression of NIS in the thyroid allows isotopic scanning, treatment of hyperthyroidism, and ablation of thyroid cancer with radioisotopes of iodine, without significant effects on other organs. Mutation of the NIS gene is a rare cause of congenital hypothyroidism, underscoring its importance in thyroid hormone synthesis. Another iodine transporter, pendrin, is located on the apical surface of thyroid cells and mediates iodine efflux into the lumen. Mutation of the pendrin gene causes Pendred syndrome, a disorder characterized by defective organification of iodine, goiter, and sensorineural deafness.

Iodine deficiency is prevalent in many mountainous regions and in central Africa, central South America, and northern Asia (Fig. 341-3). Europe remains mildly iodine deficient and health surveys indicate that iodine intake has been falling in the United States and Australia. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 2 billion people are iodine-deficient, based on urinary excretion data. In areas of relative iodine deficiency, there is an increased prevalence of goiter and, when deficiency is severe, hypothyroidism and cretinism. Cretinism is characterized by mental and growth retardation and occurs when children who live in iodine-deficient regions are not treated with iodine or thyroid hormone to restore normal thyroid hormone levels during early life. These children are often born to mothers with iodine deficiency, and it is likely that maternal thyroid hormone deficiency worsens the condition. Concomitant selenium deficiency may also contribute to the neurologic manifestations of cretinism. Iodine supplementation of salt, bread, and other food substances has markedly reduced the prevalence of cretinism. Unfortunately, however, iodine deficiency remains the most common cause of preventable mental deficiency, often because of societal resistance to food additives or the cost of supplementation. In addition to overt cretinism, mild iodine deficiency can lead to subtle reduction of IQ. Oversupply of iodine, through supplements or foods enriched in iodine (e.g., shellfish, kelp), is associated with an increased incidence of autoimmune thyroid disease. The recommended average daily intake of iodine is 150每250 g/d for adults, 90每120 g/d for children, and 250 g/d for pregnant and lactating women. Urinary iodine is >10 g/dL in iodine-sufficient populations.

Organification, Coupling, Storage, Release

After iodide enters the thyroid, it is trapped and transported to the apical membrane of thyroid follicular cells, where it is oxidized in an organification reaction that involves TPO and hydrogen peroxide. The reactive iodine atom is added to selected tyrosyl residues within Tg, a large (660 kDa) dimeric protein that consists of 2769 amino acids. The iodotyrosines in Tg are then coupled via an ether linkage in a reaction that is also catalyzed by TPO. Either T4 or T3 can be produced by this reaction, depending on the number of iodine atoms present in the iodotyrosines. After coupling, Tg is taken back into the thyroid cell, where it is processed in lysosomes to release T4 and T3. Uncoupled mono- and diiodotyrosines (MIT, DIT) are deiodinated by the enzyme dehalogenase, thereby recycling any iodide that is not converted into thyroid hormones.

Disorders of thyroid hormone synthesis are rare causes of congenital hypothyroidism. The vast majority of these disorders are due to recessive mutations in TPO or Tg, but defects have also been identified in the TSH-R, NIS, pendrin, hydrogen peroxide generation, and dehalogenase. Because of the biosynthetic defect, the gland is incapable of synthesizing adequate amounts of hormone, leading to increased TSH and a large goiter.

TSH Action

TSH regulates thyroid gland function through the TSH-R, a seven-transmembrane G protein每coupled receptor (GPCR). The TSH-R is coupled to the  subunit of stimulatory G protein (Gs), which activates adenylyl cyclase, leading to increased production of cyclic AMP. TSH also stimulates phosphatidylinositol turnover by activating phospholipase C. The functional role of the TSH-R is exemplified by the consequences of naturally occurring mutations. Recessive loss-of-function mutations cause thyroid hypoplasia and congenital hypothyroidism. Dominant gain-of-function mutations cause sporadic or familial hyperthyroidism that is characterized by goiter, thyroid cell hyperplasia, and autonomous function. Most of these activating mutations occur in the transmembrane domain of the receptor. They mimic the conformational changes induced by TSH binding or the interactions of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) in Graves' disease. Activating TSH-R mutations also occur as somatic events, leading to clonal selection and expansion of the affected thyroid follicular cell and autonomously functioning thyroid nodules (see below).

Other Factors that Influence Hormone Synthesis and Release

Although TSH is the dominant hormonal regulator of thyroid gland growth and function, a variety of growth factors, most produced locally in the thyroid gland, also influence thyroid hormone synthesis. These include insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1), epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor  (TGF-), endothelins, and various cytokines. The quantitative roles of these factors are not well understood, but they are important in selected disease states. In acromegaly, for example, increased levels of growth hormone and IGF-1 are associated with goiter and predisposition to multinodular goiter (MNG). Certain cytokines and interleukins (ILs) produced in association with autoimmune thyroid disease induce thyroid growth, whereas others lead to apoptosis. Iodine deficiency increases thyroid blood flow and upregulates the NIS, stimulating more efficient iodine uptake. Excess iodide transiently inhibits thyroid iodide organification, a phenomenon known as the Wolff-Chaikoff effect. In individuals with a normal thyroid, the gland escapes from this inhibitory effect and iodide organification resumes; the suppressive action of high iodide may persist, however, in patients with underlying autoimmune thyroid disease.

Thyroid Hormone Transport and Metabolism

Serum Binding Proteins

T4 is secreted from the thyroid gland in about twentyfold excess over T3(Table 341-2). Both hormones are bound to plasma proteins, including thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), transthyretin (TTR, formerly known as thyroxine-binding prealbumin, or TBPA), and albumin. The plasma-binding proteins increase the pool of circulating hormone, delay hormone clearance, and may modulate hormone delivery to selected tissue sites. The concentration of TBG is relatively low (1每2 mg/dL), but because of its high affinity for thyroid hormones (T4 > T3), it carries about 80% of the bound hormones. Albumin has relatively low affinity for thyroid hormones but has a high plasma concentration (3.5 g/dL), and it binds up to 10% of T4 and 30% of T3. TTR carries about 10% of T4 but little T3.

When the effects of the various binding proteins are combined, approximately 99.98% of T4 and 99.7% of T3 are protein-bound. Because T3 is less tightly bound than T4, the fraction of unbound T3 is greater than unbound T4, but there is less unbound T3 in the circulation because it is produced in smaller amounts and cleared more rapidly than T4. The unbound or "free" concentrations of the hormones are 2 ℅ 1011M for T4 and 6 ℅ 1012M for T3, which roughly correspond to the thyroid hormone receptor binding constants for these hormones (see below). The unbound hormone is thought to be biologically available to tissues. Nonetheless, the homeostatic mechanisms that regulate the thyroid axis are directed toward maintenance of normal concentrations of unbound hormones.

Abnormalities of Thyroid Hormone Binding Proteins

A number of inherited and acquired abnormalities affect thyroid hormone binding proteins. X-linked TBG deficiency is associated with very low levels of total T4 and T3. However, because unbound hormone levels are normal, patients are euthyroid and TSH levels are normal. It is important to recognize this disorder to avoid efforts to normalize total T4 levels, as this leads to thyrotoxicosis and is futile because of rapid hormone clearance in the absence of TBG. TBG levels are elevated by estrogen, which increases sialylation and delays TBG clearance. Consequently, in women who are pregnant or taking estrogen-containing contraceptives, elevated TBG increases total T4 and T3 levels; however, unbound T4 and T3 levels are normal. These features are part of the explanation for why women with hypothyroidism require increased amounts of l-thyroxine replacement as TBG levels are increased by pregnancy or estrogen treatment. Mutations in TBG, TTR, and albumin may increase the binding affinity for T4 and/or T3 and cause disorders known as euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia or familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia (FDH) (Table 341-3). These disorders result in increased total T4 and/or T3, but unbound hormone levels are normal. The familial nature of the disorders, and the fact that TSH levels are normal rather than suppressed, should suggest this diagnosis. Unbound hormone levels (ideally measured by dialysis) are normal in FDH. The diagnosis can be confirmed by using tests that measure the affinities of radiolabeled hormone binding to specific transport proteins or by performing DNA sequence analyses of the abnormal transport protein genes.

Certain medications, such as salicylates and salsalate, can displace thyroid hormones from circulating binding proteins. Although these drugs transiently perturb the thyroid axis by increasing free thyroid hormone levels, TSH is suppressed until a new steady state is reached, thereby restoring euthyroidism. Circulating factors associated with acute illness may also displace thyroid hormone from binding proteins (see "Sick Euthyroid Syndrome," below).

Deiodinases

T4 may be thought of as a precursor for the more potent T3. T4 is converted to T3 by the deiodinase enzymes (Fig. 341-1). Type I deiodinase, which is located primarily in thyroid, liver, and kidneys, has a relatively low affinity for T4. Type II deiodinase has a higher affinity for T4 and is found primarily in the pituitary gland, brain, brown fat, and thyroid gland. Expression of type II deiodinase allows it to regulate T3 concentrations locally, a property that may be important in the context of levothyroxine (T4) replacement. Type II deiodinase is also regulated by thyroid hormone; hypothyroidism induces the enzyme, resulting in enhanced T4  T3 conversion in tissues such as brain and pituitary. T4  T3 conversion is impaired by fasting, systemic illness or acute trauma, oral contrast agents, and a variety of medications (e.g., propylthiouracil, propranolol, amiodarone, glucocorticoids). Type III deiodinase inactivates T4 and T3 and is the most important source of reverse T3 (rT3). Massive hemangiomas that express type III deiodinase are a rare cause of hypothyroidism in infants.

Thyroid Hormone Action

Thyroid Hormone Transport

Circulating thyroid hormones enter cells by passive diffusion and via specific transporters such as the monocarboxylate 8 (MCT8) transporter. Mutations in the MCT8 gene have been identified in patients with X-linked psychomotor retardation and thyroid function abnormalities (low T4, high T3, and high TSH). After entering cells, thyroid hormones act primarily through nuclear receptors, although they also have nongenomic actions through stimulating plasma membrane and mitochondrial enzymatic responses.

Nuclear Thyroid Hormone Receptors

Thyroid hormones bind with high affinity to nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (TRs)  and . Both TR and TR are expressed in most tissues, but their relative expression levels vary among organs; TR is particularly abundant in brain, kidneys, gonads, muscle, and heart, whereas TR expression is relatively high in the pituitary and liver. Both receptors are variably spliced to form unique isoforms. The TR2 isoform, which has a unique amino terminus, is selectively expressed in the hypothalamus and pituitary, where it plays a role in feedback control of the thyroid axis (see above). The TR2 isoform contains a unique carboxy terminus that precludes thyroid hormone binding; it may function to block the action of other TR isoforms.

The TRs contain a central DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain. They bind to specific DNA sequences, termed thyroid response elements (TREs), in the promoter regions of target genes (Fig. 341-4). The receptors bind as homodimers or, more commonly, as heterodimers with retinoic acid X receptors (RXRs) (Chap. 338). The activated receptor can either stimulate gene transcription (e.g., myosin heavy chain ) or inhibit transcription (e.g., TSH -subunit gene), depending on the nature of the regulatory elements in the target gene.

Figure 341-4 Mechanism of Thyroid Hormone Receptor Action.

 
 
 
The thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) form heterodimers that bind specifically to thyroid hormone response elements (TRE) in the promoter regions of target genes. In the absence of hormone, TR binds co-repressor (CoR) proteins that silence gene expression. The numbers refer to a series of ordered reactions that occur in response to thyroid hormone: (1) T4 or T3 enters the nucleus; (2) T3 binding dissociates CoR from TR; (3) Coactivators (CoA) are recruited to the T3-bound receptor; (4) gene expression is altered.
 
 

Thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) bind with similar affinities to TR and TR. However, structural differences in the ligand binding domains provide the potential for developing receptor-selective agonists or antagonists. T3 is bound with 10每15 times greater affinity than T4, which explains its increased hormonal potency. Though T4 is produced in excess of T3, receptors are occupied mainly by T3, reflecting T4  T3 conversion by peripheral tissues, greater T3 bioavailability in the plasma, and receptors' greater affinity for T3. After binding to TRs, thyroid hormone induces conformational changes in the receptors that modify its interactions with accessory transcription factors. Importantly, in the absence of thyroid hormone binding, the aporeceptors bind to co-repressor proteins that inhibit gene transcription. Hormone binding dissociates the co-repressors and allows the recruitment of coactivators that enhance transcription. The discovery of TR interactions with corepressors explains the fact that TR silences gene expression in the absence of hormone binding. Consequently, hormone deficiency has a profound effect on gene expression because it causes gene repression as well as loss of hormone-induced stimulation. This concept has been corroborated by the finding that targeted deletion of the TR genes in mice has a less-pronounced phenotypic effect than hormone deficiency.

Thyroid Hormone Resistance

Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by elevated thyroid hormone levels and inappropriately normal or elevated TSH. Individuals with RTH do not, in general, exhibit signs and symptoms that are typical of hypothyroidism because hormone resistance is partial and is compensated by increased levels of thyroid hormone. The clinical features of RTH can include goiter, attention deficit disorder, mild reduction in IQ, delayed skeletal maturation, tachycardia, and impaired metabolic responses to thyroid hormone.

RTH is caused by mutations in the TR receptor gene. These mutations, located in restricted regions of the ligand-binding domain, cause loss of receptor function. However, because the mutant receptors retain the capacity to dimerize with RXRs, bind to DNA, and recruit co-repressor proteins, they function as antagonists of the remaining normal TR and TR receptors. This property, referred to as "dominant negative" activity, explains the autosomal dominant mode of transmission. The diagnosis is suspected when unbound thyroid hormone levels are increased without suppression of TSH. Similar hormonal abnormalities are found in other affected family members, although the TR mutation arises de novo in about 20% of patients. DNA sequence analysis of the TR gene provides a definitive diagnosis. RTH must be distinguished from other causes of euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia (e.g., FDH) and inappropriate secretion of TSH by TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas (Chap. 339). In most patients, no treatment is indicated; the importance of making the diagnosis is to avoid inappropriate treatment of mistaken hyperthyroidism and to provide genetic counseling.

Physical Examination

In addition to the examination of the thyroid itself, the physical examination should include a search for signs of abnormal thyroid function and the extrathyroidal features of ophthalmopathy and dermopathy (see below). Examination of the neck begins by inspecting the seated patient from the front and side and noting any surgical scars, obvious masses, or distended veins. The thyroid can be palpated with both hands from behind or while facing the patient, using the thumbs to palpate each lobe. It is best to use a combination of these methods, especially when nodules are small. The patient's neck should be slightly flexed to relax the neck muscles. After locating the cricoid cartilage, the isthmus can be identified and followed laterally to locate either lobe (normally, the right lobe is slightly larger than the left). By asking the patient to swallow sips of water, thyroid consistency can be better appreciated as the gland moves beneath the examiner's fingers.

Features to be noted include thyroid size, consistency, nodularity, and any tenderness or fixation. An estimate of thyroid size (normally 12每20 g) should be made, and a drawing is often the best way to record findings. However, ultrasound is the method of choice when it is important to determine thyroid size accurately. The size, location, and consistency of any nodules should also be defined. A bruit over the gland indicates increased vascularity, as occurs in hyperthyroidism. If the lower borders of the thyroid lobes are not clearly felt, a goiter may be retrosternal. Large retrosternal goiters can cause venous distention over the neck and difficulty breathing, especially when the arms are raised (Pemberton's sign). With any central mass above the thyroid, the tongue should be extended, as thyroglossal cysts then move upward. The thyroid examination is not complete without assessment for lymphadenopathy in the supraclavicular and cervical regions of the neck.

Laboratory Evaluation

Measurement of Thyroid Hormones

The enhanced sensitivity and specificity of TSH assays have greatly improved laboratory assessment of thyroid function. Because TSH levels change dynamically in response to alterations of T4 and T3, a logical approach to thyroid testing is to first determine whether TSH is suppressed, normal, or elevated. With rare exceptions (see below), a normal TSH level excludes a primary abnormality of thyroid function. This strategy depends on the use of immunochemiluminometric assays (ICMAs) for TSH that are sensitive enough to discriminate between the lower limit of the reference range and the suppressed values that occur with thyrotoxicosis. Extremely sensitive (fourth-generation) assays can detect TSH levels 0.004 mU/L, but, for practical purposes, assays sensitive to 0.1 mU/L are sufficient. The widespread availability of the TSH ICMA has rendered the TRH stimulation test obsolete, because the failure of TSH to rise after an intravenous bolus of 200每400 g TRH has the same implications as a suppressed basal TSH measured by ICMA.

The finding of an abnormal TSH level must be followed by measurements of circulating thyroid hormone levels to confirm the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism (suppressed TSH) or hypothyroidism (elevated TSH). Radioimmunoassays are widely available for serum total T4 and total T3. T4 and T3 are highly protein-bound, and numerous factors (illness, medications, genetic factors) can influence protein binding. It is useful, therefore, to measure the free, or unbound, hormone levels, which correspond to the biologically available hormone pool. Two direct methods are used to measure unbound thyroid hormones: (1) unbound thyroid hormone competition with radiolabeled T4 (or an analogue) for binding to a solid-phase antibody, and (2) physical separation of the unbound hormone fraction by ultracentrifugation or equilibrium dialysis. Though early unbound hormone immunoassays suffered from artifacts, newer assays correlate well with the results of the more technically demanding and expensive physical separation methods. An indirect method to estimate unbound thyroid hormone levels is to calculate the free T3 or free T4 index from the total T4 or T3 concentration and the thyroid hormone binding ratio (THBR). The latter is derived from the T3-resin uptake test, which determines the distribution of radiolabeled T3 between an absorbent resin and the unoccupied thyroid hormone binding proteins in the sample. The binding of the labeled T3 to the resin is increased when there is reduced unoccupied protein binding sites (e.g., TBG deficiency) or increased total thyroid hormone in the sample; it is decreased under the opposite circumstances. The product of THBR and total T3 or T4 provides the free T3or T4index. In effect, the index corrects for anomalous total hormone values caused by abnormalities in hormone-protein binding.

Total thyroid hormone levels are elevated when TBG is increased due to estrogens (pregnancy, oral contraceptives, hormone therapy, tamoxifen), and decreased when TBG binding is reduced (androgens, nephrotic syndrome). Genetic disorders and acute illness can also cause abnormalities in thyroid hormone binding proteins, and various drugs [phenytoin, carbamazepine, salicylates, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)] can interfere with thyroid hormone binding. Because unbound thyroid hormone levels are normal and the patient is euthyroid in all of these circumstances, assays that measure unbound hormone are preferable to those for total thyroid hormones.

For most purposes, the unbound T4 level is sufficient to confirm thyrotoxicosis, but 2每5% of patients have only an elevated T3 level (T3 toxicosis). Thus, unbound T3 levels should be measured in patients with a suppressed TSH but normal unbound T4 levels.

There are several clinical conditions in which the use of TSH as a screening test may be misleading, particularly without simultaneous unbound T4 determinations. Any severe nonthyroidal illness can cause abnormal TSH levels (see below). Although hypothyroidism is the most common cause of an elevated TSH level, rare causes include a TSH-secreting pituitary tumor (Chap. 339), thyroid hormone resistance, and assay artifact. Conversely, a suppressed TSH level, particularly <0.1 mU/L, usually indicates thyrotoxicosis but may also be seen during the first trimester of pregnancy (due to hCG secretion), after treatment of hyperthyroidism (because TSH can remain suppressed for several months), and in response to certain medications (e.g., high doses of glucocorticoids or dopamine). Importantly, secondary hypothyroidism, caused by hypothalamic-pituitary disease, is associated with a variable (low to high-normal) TSH level, which is inappropriate for the low T4 level. Thus, TSH should not be used as an isolated laboratory test to assess thyroid function in patients with suspected or known pituitary disease.

Tests for the end-organ effects of thyroid hormone excess or depletion, such as estimation of basal metabolic rate, tendon reflex relaxation rates, or serum cholesterol, are not useful as clinical determinants of thyroid function.

Tests to Determine the Etiology of Thyroid Dysfunction

Autoimmune thyroid disease is detected most easily by measuring circulating antibodies against TPO and Tg. As antibodies to Tg alone are uncommon, it is reasonable to measure only TPO antibodies. About 5每15% of euthyroid women and up to 2% of euthyroid men have thyroid antibodies; such individuals are at increased risk of developing thyroid dysfunction. Almost all patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism, and up to 80% of those with Graves' disease, have TPO antibodies, usually at high levels.

TSI are antibodies that stimulate the TSH-R in Graves' disease. They can be measured in bioassays or indirectly in assays for TSH-binding inhibiting immunoglobulins (TBII) that detect antibody binding to the receptor. The main use of these assays is to predict neonatal thyrotoxicosis caused by high maternal levels of TSI in the last trimester of pregnancy.

Serum Tg levels are increased in all types of thyrotoxicosis except thyrotoxicosis factitia caused by self-administration of thyroid hormone. Tg levels are particularly increased in thyroiditis, reflecting thyroid tissue destruction and release of Tg. The main role for Tg measurement, however, is in the follow-up of thyroid cancer patients. After total thyroidectomy and radioablation, Tg levels should be undetectable; in the absence of anti-Tg antibodies, measurable levels indicate incomplete ablation or recurrent cancer.

Radioiodine Uptake and Thyroid Scanning

The thyroid gland selectively transports radioisotopes of iodine (123I, 125I, 131I) and 99mTc pertechnetate, allowing thyroid imaging and quantitation of radioactive tracer fractional uptake.

Nuclear imaging of Graves' disease is characterized by an enlarged gland and increased tracer uptake that is distributed homogeneously. Toxic adenomas appear as focal areas of increased uptake, with suppressed tracer uptake in the remainder of the gland. In toxic MNG, the gland is enlarged〞often with distorted architecture〞and there are multiple areas of relatively increased or decreased tracer uptake. Subacute thyroiditis is associated with very low uptake because of follicular cell damage and TSH suppression. Thyrotoxicosis factitia is also associated with low uptake.

Although the use of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy has diminished the use of thyroid scans in the evaluation of solitary thyroid nodules, the functional features of thyroid nodules have some prognostic significance. So-called cold nodules, which have diminished tracer uptake, are usually benign. However, these nodules are more likely to be malignant (5每10%) than so-called hot nodules, which are almost never malignant.

Thyroid scanning is also used in the follow-up of thyroid cancer. After thyroidectomy and ablation using 131I, there is diminished radioiodine uptake in the thyroid bed, allowing the detection of metastatic thyroid cancer deposits that retain the ability to transport iodine. Whole-body scans using 111每185 MBq (3每5 mCi) 131I are typically performed after thyroid hormone withdrawal to raise the TSH level or after the administration of recombinant human TSH.

Thyroid Ultrasound

Ultrasonography is used increasingly to assist in the diagnosis of nodular thyroid disease, a reflection of the limitations of the physical examination and improvements in ultrasound technology. Using 10-MHz instruments, spatial resolution and image quality are excellent, allowing the detection of nodules and cysts >3 mm. In addition to detecting thyroid nodules, ultrasound is useful for monitoring nodule size and for the aspiration of nodules or cystic lesions. Ultrasound-guided FNA biopsy of thyroid lesions lowers the rate of inadequate sampling. Ultrasonography is also used in the evaluation of recurrent thyroid cancer, including possible spread to cervical lymph nodes.
 
Hypothyroidism

Iodine deficiency remains the most common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide. In areas of iodine sufficiency, autoimmune disease (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) and iatrogenic causes (treatment of hyperthyroidism) are most common (Table 341-4).

Congenital Hypothyroidism

Prevalence

Hypothyroidism occurs in about 1 in 4000 newborns. It may be transient, especially if the mother has TSH-R blocking antibodies or has received antithyroid drugs, but permanent hypothyroidism occurs in the majority. Neonatal hypothyroidism is due to thyroid gland dysgenesis in 80每85%, to inborn errors of thyroid hormone synthesis in 10每15%, and is TSH-R antibody-mediated in 5% of affected newborns. The developmental abnormalities are twice as common in girls. Mutations that cause congenital hypothyroidism are being increasingly identified, but the vast majority remain idiopathic(Table 341-1).

Clinical Manifestations

The majority of infants appear normal at birth, and <10% are diagnosed based on clinical features, which include prolonged jaundice, feeding problems, hypotonia, enlarged tongue, delayed bone maturation, and umbilical hernia. Importantly, permanent neurologic damage results if treatment is delayed. Typical features of adult hypothyroidism may also be present (Table 341-5). Other congenital malformations, especially cardiac, are four times more common in congenital hypothyroidism.

Diagnosis and Treatment

Because of the severe neurologic consequences of untreated congenital hypothyroidism, neonatal screening programs have been established. These are generally based on measurement of TSH or T4 levels in heel-prick blood specimens. When the diagnosis is confirmed, T4 is instituted at a dose of 10每15 g/kg per day, and the dose is adjusted by close monitoring of TSH levels. T4 requirements are relatively great during the first year of life, and a high circulating T4 level is usually needed to normalize TSH. Early treatment with T4 results in normal IQ levels, but subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities may occur in those with the most severe hypothyroidism at diagnosis or when treatment is delayed or suboptimal.

Autoimmune Hypothyroidism

Classification

Autoimmune hypothyroidism may be associated with a goiter (Hashimoto's, or goitrous thyroiditis) or, at the later stages of the disease, minimal residual thyroid tissue (atrophic thyroiditis). Because the autoimmune process gradually reduces thyroid function, there is a phase of compensation when normal thyroid hormone levels are maintained by a rise in TSH. Though some patients may have minor symptoms, this state is called subclinical hypothyroidism. Later, unbound T4 levels fall and TSH levels rise further; symptoms become more readily apparent at this stage (usually TSH >10 mIU/L), which is referred to as clinical hypothyroidism or overt hypothyroidism.

Prevalence

The mean annual incidence rate of autoimmune hypothyroidism is up to 4 per 1000 women and 1 per 1000 men. It is more common in certain populations, such as the Japanese, probably because of genetic factors and chronic exposure to a high-iodine diet. The mean age at diagnosis is 60 years, and the prevalence of overt hypothyroidism increases with age. Subclinical hypothyroidism is found in 6每8% of women (10% over the age of 60) and 3% of men. The annual risk of developing clinical hypothyroidism is about 4% when subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with positive TPO antibodies.

Pathogenesis

In Hashimoto's thyroiditis, there is a marked lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid with germinal center formation, atrophy of the thyroid follicles accompanied by oxyphil metaplasia, absence of colloid, and mild to moderate fibrosis. In atrophic thyroiditis, the fibrosis is much more extensive, lymphocyte infiltration is less pronounced, and thyroid follicles are almost completely absent. Atrophic thyroiditis likely represents the end stage of Hashimoto's thyroiditis rather than a distinct disorder.

As with most autoimmune disorders, susceptibility to autoimmune hypothyroidism is determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and the risk of either autoimmune hypothyroidism or Graves' disease is increased among siblings. HLA-DR polymorphisms are the best documented genetic risk factors for autoimmune hypothyroidism, especially HLA-DR3, -DR4, and -DR5 in Caucasians. A weak association also exists between polymorphisms in CTLA-4, a T cell每regulatory gene, and autoimmune hypothyroidism. Both of these genetic associations are shared by other autoimmune diseases, which may explain the relationship between autoimmune hypothyroidism and other autoimmune diseases, especially type 1 diabetes mellitus, Addison's disease, pernicious anemia, and vitiligo (Chap. 351). HLA-DR and CTLA-4 polymorphisms account for approximately half of the genetic susceptibility to autoimmune hypothyroidism. Other contributory loci remain to be identified. A gene on chromosome 21 may be responsible for the association between autoimmune hypothyroidism and Down syndrome. The female preponderance of thyroid autoimmunity is most likely due to sex steroid effects on the immune response, but an X chromosome每related genetic factor is also possible and may account for the high frequency of autoimmune hypothyroidism in Turner's syndrome. Environmental susceptibility factors are poorly defined at present. A high iodine intake may increase the risk of autoimmune hypothyroidism by immunologic effects or direct thyroid toxicity. There is no convincing evidence for a role of infection except for the congenital rubella syndrome, in which there is a high frequency of autoimmune hypothyroidism. Viral thyroiditis does not induce subsequent autoimmune thyroid disease.

The thyroid lymphocytic infiltrate in autoimmune hypothyroidism is composed of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as B cells. Thyroid cell destruction is primarily mediated by the CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, which destroy their targets by either perforin-induced cell necrosis or granzyme B每induced apoptosis. In addition, local T cell production of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-1, and interferon  (IFN-), may render thyroid cells more susceptible to apoptosis mediated by death receptors, such as Fas, which are activated by their respective ligands on T cells. These cytokines also impair thyroid cell function directly and induce the expression of other proinflammatory molecules by the thyroid cells themselves, such as cytokines, HLA class I and class II molecules, adhesion molecules, CD40, and nitric oxide. Administration of high concentrations of cytokines for therapeutic purposes (especially IFN-) is associated with increased autoimmune thyroid disease, possibly through mechanisms similar to those in sporadic disease.

Antibodies to TPO and Tg are clinically useful markers of thyroid autoimmunity, but any pathogenic effect is restricted to a secondary role in amplifying an ongoing autoimmune response. TPO antibodies fix complement, and complement membrane-attack complexes are present in the thyroid in autoimmune hypothyroidism. However, transplacental passage of Tg or TPO antibodies has no effect on the fetal thyroid, which suggests that T cell每mediated injury is required to initiate autoimmune damage to the thyroid.

Up to 20% of patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism have antibodies against the TSH-R, which, in contrast to TSI, do not stimulate the receptor but prevent the binding of TSH. These TSH-R-blocking antibodies, therefore, cause hypothyroidism and, especially in Asian patients, thyroid atrophy. Their transplacental passage may induce transient neonatal hypothyroidism. Rarely, patients have a mixture of TSI and TSH-R-blocking antibodies, and thyroid function can oscillate between hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism as one or the other antibody becomes dominant. Predicting the course of disease in such individuals is difficult, and they require close monitoring of thyroid function. Bioassays can be used to document that TSH-R-blocking antibodies reduce the cyclic AMP每inducing effect of TSH on cultured TSH-R-expressing cells, but these assays are difficult to perform. TBII assays that measure the binding of antibodies to the receptor by competition with radiolabeled TSH do not distinguish between TSI- and TSH-R-blocking antibodies, but a positive result in a patient with spontaneous hypothyroidism is strong evidence for the presence of blocking antibodies. The use of these assays does not generally alter clinical management, although it may be useful to confirm the cause of transient neonatal hypothyroidism.

Clinical Manifestations

The main clinical features of hypothyroidism are summarized in Table 341-5. The onset is usually insidious, and the patient may become aware of symptoms only when euthyroidism is restored. Patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis may present because of goiter rather than symptoms of hypothyroidism. The goiter may not be large, but it is usually irregular and firm in consistency. It is often possible to palpate a pyramidal lobe, normally a vestigial remnant of the thyroglossal duct. Rarely is uncomplicated Hashimoto's thyroiditis associated with pain.

Patients with atrophic thyroiditis or the late stage of Hashimoto's thyroiditis present with symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism. The skin is dry, and there is decreased sweating, thinning of the epidermis, and hyperkeratosis of the stratum corneum. Increased dermal glycosaminoglycan content traps water, giving rise to skin thickening without pitting (myxedema). Typical features include a puffy face with edematous eyelids and nonpitting pretibial edema (Fig. 341-5). There is pallor, often with a yellow tinge to the skin due to carotene accumulation. Nail growth is retarded, and hair is dry, brittle, difficult to manage, and falls out easily. In addition to diffuse alopecia, there is thinning of the outer third of the eyebrows, although this is not a specific sign of hypothyroidism.

Figure 341-5 Facial Appearance in Hypothyroidism.

 
 
 
Note puffy eyes and thickened skin.
 
 

Other common features include constipation and weight gain (despite a poor appetite). In contrast to popular perception, the weight gain is usually modest and due mainly to fluid retention in the myxedematous tissues. Libido is decreased in both sexes, and there may be oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea in long-standing disease, but menorrhagia is also common. Fertility is reduced, and the incidence of miscarriage is increased. Prolactin levels are often modestly increased (Chap. 339) and may contribute to alterations in libido and fertility and cause galactorrhea.

Myocardial contractility and pulse rate are reduced, leading to a reduced stroke volume and bradycardia. Increased peripheral resistance may be accompanied by hypertension, particularly diastolic. Blood flow is diverted from the skin, producing cool extremities. Pericardial effusions occur in up to 30% of patients but rarely compromise cardiac function. Though alterations in myosin heavy chain isoform expression have been documented, cardiomyopathy is unusual. Fluid may also accumulate in other serous cavities and in the middle ear, giving rise to conductive deafness. Pulmonary function is generally normal, but dyspnea may be caused by pleural effusion, impaired respiratory muscle function, diminished ventilatory drive, or sleep apnea.

Carpal tunnel and other entrapment syndromes are common, as is impairment of muscle function with stiffness, cramps, and pain. On examination, there may be slow relaxation of tendon reflexes and pseudomyotonia. Memory and concentration are impaired. Experimentally, PET scans examining glucose metabolism in hypothyroid subjects show lower regional activity in the amygdala, hippocampus, and perigenual anterior cingulated cortex, among other regions, and this activity corrects after thyroxine replacement. Rare neurologic problems include reversible cerebellar ataxia, dementia, psychosis, and myxedema coma. Hashimoto's encephalopathy has been defined as a steroid-responsive syndrome associated with TPO antibodies, myoclonus, and slow-wave activity on electroencephalography, but the relationship with thyroid autoimmunity or hypothyroidism is not established. The hoarse voice and occasionally clumsy speech of hypothyroidism reflect fluid accumulation in the vocal cords and tongue.

The features described above are the consequence of thyroid hormone deficiency. However, autoimmune hypothyroidism may be associated with signs or symptoms of other autoimmune diseases, particularly vitiligo, pernicious anemia, Addison's disease, alopecia areata, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Less-common associations include celiac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, chronic active hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), myasthenia gravis, and Sj?gren's syndrome. Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy, which usually occurs in Graves' disease (see below), occurs in about 5% of patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism.

Autoimmune hypothyroidism is uncommon in children and usually presents with slow growth and delayed facial maturation. The appearance of permanent teeth is also delayed. Myopathy, with muscle swelling, is more common in children than in adults. In most cases, puberty is delayed, but precocious puberty sometimes occurs. There may be intellectual impairment if the onset is before 3 years and the hormone deficiency is severe.

Laboratory Evaluation

A summary of the investigations used to determine the existence and cause of hypothyroidism is provided in Fig. 341-6. A normal TSH level excludes primary (but not secondary) hypothyroidism. If the TSH is elevated, an unbound T4 level is needed to confirm the presence of clinical hypothyroidism, but T4 is inferior to TSH when used as a screening test, because it will not detect subclinical hypothyroidism. Circulating unbound T3 levels are normal in about 25% of patients, reflecting adaptive deiodinase responses to hypothyroidism. T3 measurements are, therefore, not indicated.

Figure 341-6 Evaluation of Hypothyroidism.

 
 
 
TPOAb+, thyroid peroxidase antibodies present; TPOAb每, thyroid peroxidase antibodies not present; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone.
 
 

Once clinical or subclinical hypothyroidism is confirmed, the etiology is usually easily established by demonstrating the presence of TPO antibodies, which are present in >90% of patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism. TBII can be found in 10每20% of patients, but these determinations are not needed routinely. If there is any doubt about the cause of a goiter associated with hypothyroidism, FNA biopsy can be used to confirm the presence of autoimmune thyroiditis. Other abnormal laboratory findings in hypothyroidism may include increased creatine phosphokinase, elevated cholesterol and triglycerides, and anemia (usually normocytic or macrocytic). Except when accompanied by iron deficiency, the anemia and other abnormalities gradually resolve with thyroxine replacement.

Differential Diagnosis

An asymmetric goiter in Hashimoto's thyroiditis may be confused with a multinodular goiter or thyroid carcinoma, in which thyroid antibodies may also be present. Ultrasound can be used to show the presence of a solitary lesion or a multinodular goiter rather than the heterogeneous thyroid enlargement typical of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. FNA biopsy is useful in the investigation of focal nodules. Other causes of hypothyroidism are discussed below and in Table 341-14, but rarely cause diagnostic confusion.

Other Causes of Hypothyroidism

Iatrogenic hypothyroidism is a common cause of hypothyroidism and can often be detected by screening before symptoms develop. In the first 3每4 months after radioiodine treatment, transient hypothyroidism may occur due to reversible radiation damage. Low-dose thyroxine treatment can be withdrawn if recovery occurs. Because TSH levels are suppressed by hyperthyroidism, unbound T4 levels are a better measure of thyroid function than TSH in the months following radioiodine treatment. Mild hypothyroidism after subtotal thyroidectomy may also resolve after several months, as the gland remnant is stimulated by increased TSH levels.

Iodine deficiency is responsible for endemic goiter and cretinism but is an uncommon cause of adult hypothyroidism unless the iodine intake is very low or there are complicating factors, such as the consumption of thiocyanates in cassava or selenium deficiency. Though hypothyroidism due to iodine deficiency can be treated with thyroxine, public health measures to improve iodine intake should be advocated to eliminate this problem. Iodized salt or bread or a single bolus of oral or intramuscular iodized oil have all been used successfully.

Paradoxically, chronic iodine excess can also induce goiter and hypothyroidism. The intracellular events that account for this effect are unclear, but individuals with autoimmune thyroiditis are especially susceptible. Iodine excess is responsible for the hypothyroidism that occurs in up to 13% of patients treated with amiodarone (see below). Other drugs, particularly lithium, may also cause hypothyroidism. Transient hypothyroidism caused by thyroiditis is discussed below.

Secondary hypothyroidism is usually diagnosed in the context of other anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies; isolated TSH deficiency is very rare (Chap. 339). TSH levels may be low, normal, or even slightly increased in secondary hypothyroidism; the latter is due to secretion of immunoactive but bioinactive forms of TSH. The diagnosis is confirmed by detecting a low unbound T4 level. The goal of treatment is to maintain T4 levels in the upper half of the reference range, because TSH levels cannot be used to monitor therapy.

Treatment: Hypothyroidism


Clinical Hypothyroidism

If there is no residual thyroid function, the daily replacement dose of levothyroxine is usually 1.6 g/kg body weight (typically 100每150 g). In many patients, however, lower doses suffice until residual thyroid tissue is destroyed. In patients who develop hypothyroidism after the treatment of Graves' disease, there is often underlying autonomous function, necessitating lower replacement doses (typically 75每125 g/d).

Adult patients under 60 without evidence of heart disease may be started on 50每100 g levothyroxine (T4) daily. The dose is adjusted on the basis of TSH levels, with the goal of treatment being a normal TSH, ideally in the lower half of the reference range. TSH responses are gradual and should be measured about two months after instituting treatment or after any subsequent change in levothyroxine dosage. The clinical effects of levothyroxine replacement are slow to appear. Patients may not experience full relief from symptoms until 3每6 months after normal TSH levels are restored. Adjustment of levothyroxine dosage is made in 12.5- or 25-g increments if the TSH is high; decrements of the same magnitude should be made if the TSH is suppressed. Patients with a suppressed TSH of any cause, including T4 overtreatment, have an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and reduced bone density.

Although dessicated animal thyroid preparations (thyroid extract USP) are available, they are not recommended because the ratio of T3 to T4 is nonphysiologic. The use of levothyroxine combined with liothyronine (triiodothyronine, T3) has been investigated, but benefit has not been confirmed in prospective studies. There is no place for liothyronine alone as long-term replacement, because the short half-life necessitates three or four daily doses and is associated with fluctuating T3 levels.

Once full replacement is achieved and TSH levels are stable, follow-up measurement of TSH is recommended at annual intervals and may be extended to every 2每3 years if a normal TSH is maintained over several years. It is important to ensure ongoing adherence, however, as patients do not feel any symptomatic difference after missing a few doses of levothyroxine, and this sometimes leads to self-discontinuation.

In patients of normal body weight who are taking 200 g of levothyroxine per day, an elevated TSH level is often a sign of poor adherence to treatment. This is also the likely explanation for fluctuating TSH levels, despite a constant levothyroxine dosage. Such patients often have normal or high unbound T4 levels, despite an elevated TSH, because they remember to take medication for a few days before testing; this is sufficient to normalize T4, but not TSH levels. It is important to consider variable adherence, because this pattern of thyroid function tests is otherwise suggestive of disorders associated with inappropriate TSH secretion (Table 341-3). Because T4 has a long half-life (7 days), patients who miss a dose can be advised to take two doses of the skipped tablets at once. Other causes of increased levothyroxine requirements must be excluded, particularly malabsorption (e.g., celiac disease, small-bowel surgery), estrogen therapy, and drugs that interfere with T4 absorption or clearance such as cholestyramine, ferrous sulfate, calcium supplements, lovastatin, aluminum hydroxide, rifampicin, amiodarone, carbamazepine, and phenytoin.

Subclinical Hypothyroidism

By definition, subclinical hypothyroidism refers to biochemical evidence of thyroid hormone deficiency in patients who have few or no apparent clinical features of hypothyroidism. There are no universally accepted recommendations for the management of subclinical hypothyroidism, but the most recently published guidelines do not recommend routine treatment when TSH levels are below 10 mU/L. It is important to confirm that any elevation of TSH is sustained over a 3-month period before treatment is given. As long as excessive treatment is avoided, there is no risk in correcting a slightly increased TSH. Moreover, there is a risk that patients will progress to overt hypothyroidism, particularly when the TSH level is elevated and TPO antibodies are present. Treatment is administered by starting with a low dose of levothyroxine (25每50 g/d) with the goal of normalizing TSH. If thyroxine is not given, thyroid function should be evaluated annually.

Special Treatment Considerations

Rarely, levothyroxine replacement is associated with pseudotumor cerebri in children. Presentation appears to be idiosyncratic and occurs months after treatment has begun. Women with a history or high risk of hypothyroidism should ensure that they are euthyroid prior to conception and during early pregnancy as maternal hypothyroidism may adversely affect fetal neural development and cause preterm delivery. The presence of thyroid autoantibodies alone, in a euthyroid patient, is also associated with preterm delivery, and outcome may be improved by levothyroxine treatment. Thyroid function should be evaluated immediately after pregnancy is confirmed and at the beginning of the second and third trimesters. The dose of levothyroxine may need to be increased by 50% during pregnancy and returned to previous levels after delivery. Elderly patients may require 20% less thyroxine than younger patients. In the elderly, especially patients with known coronary artery disease, the starting dose of levothyroxine is 12.5每25 g/d with similar increments every 2每3 months until TSH is normalized. In some patients, it may be impossible to achieve full replacement despite optimal antianginal treatment. Emergency surgery is generally safe in patients with untreated hypothyroidism, although routine surgery in a hypothyroid patient should be deferred until euthyroidism is achieved.

Myxedema coma still has a high mortality rate, despite intensive treatment. Clinical manifestations include reduced level of consciousness, sometimes associated with seizures, as well as the other features of hypothyroidism (Table 341-5). Hypothermia can reach 23∼C (74∼F). There may be a history of treated hypothyroidism with poor compliance, or the patient may be previously undiagnosed. Myxedema coma almost always occurs in the elderly and is usually precipitated by factors that impair respiration, such as drugs (especially sedatives, anesthetics, antidepressants), pneumonia, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, gastrointestinal bleeding, or cerebrovascular accidents. Sepsis should also be suspected. Exposure to cold may also be a risk factor. Hypoventilation, leading to hypoxia and hypercapnia, plays a major role in pathogenesis; hypoglycemia and dilutional hyponatremia also contribute to the development of myxedema coma.

Levothyroxine can initially be administered as a single IV bolus of 500 g, which serves as a loading dose. Although further levothyroxine is not strictly necessary for several days, it is usually continued at a dose of 50每100 g/d. If suitable IV preparation is not available, the same initial dose of levothyroxine can be given by nasogastric tube (though absorption may be impaired in myxedema). An alternative is to give liothyronine (T3) intravenously or via nasogastric tube, in doses ranging from 10 to 25 g every 8每12 h. This treatment has been advocated because T4  T3 conversion is impaired in myxedema coma. However, excess liothyronine has the potential to provoke arrhythmias. Another option is to combine levothyroxine (200 g) and liothyronine (25 g) as a single, initial IV bolus followed by daily treatment with levothyroxine (50每100 g/d) and liothyronine (10 g every 8 h).

Supportive therapy should be provided to correct any associated metabolic disturbances. External warming is indicated only if the temperature is <30∼C, as it can result in cardiovascular collapse (Chap. 19). Space blankets should be used to prevent further heat loss. Parenteral hydrocortisone (50 mg every 6 h) should be administered, because there is impaired adrenal reserve in profound hypothyroidism. Any precipitating factors should be treated, including the early use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, pending the exclusion of infection. Ventilatory support with regular blood gas analysis is usually needed during the first 48 hours. Hypertonic saline or IV glucose may be needed if there is severe hyponatremia or hypoglycemia; hypotonic IV fluids should be avoided because they may exacerbate water retention secondary to reduced renal perfusion and inappropriate vasopressin secretion. The metabolism of most medications is impaired, and sedatives should be avoided if possible or used in reduced doses. Medication blood levels should be monitored, when available, to guide dosage.
 
Thyrotoxicosis

Thyrotoxicosis is defined as the state of thyroid hormone excess and is not synonymous with hyperthyroidism, which is the result of excessive thyroid function. However, the major etiologies of thyrotoxicosis are hyperthyroidism caused by Graves' disease, toxic MNG, and toxic adenomas. Other causes are listed in Table 341-6.

Graves' Disease

Epidemiology

Graves' disease accounts for 60每80% of thyrotoxicosis. The prevalence varies among populations, reflecting genetic factors and iodine intake (high iodine intake is associated with an increased prevalence of Graves' disease). Graves' disease occurs in up to 2% of women but is one-tenth as frequent in men. The disorder rarely begins before adolescence and typically occurs between 20 and 50 years of age; it also occurs in the elderly.

Pathogenesis

As in autoimmune hypothyroidism, a combination of environmental and genetic factors, including polymorphisms in HLA-DR, CTLA-4, CD25, PTPN22 (a T cell regulatory gene) and TSH-R, contribute to Graves' disease susceptibility. The concordance for Graves' disease in monozygotic twins is 20每30%, compared to <5% in dizygotic twins. Indirect evidence suggests that stress is an important environmental factor, presumably operating through neuroendocrine effects on the immune system. Smoking is a minor risk factor for Graves' disease and a major risk factor for the development of ophthalmopathy. Sudden increases in iodine intake may precipitate Graves' disease, and there is a threefold increase in the occurrence of Graves' disease in the postpartum period. Graves' disease may occur during the immune reconstitution phase after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or alemtuzumab treatment.

The hyperthyroidism of Graves' disease is caused by TSI that are synthesized in the thyroid gland as well as in bone marrow and lymph nodes. Such antibodies can be detected by bioassays or by using the more widely available TBII assays. The presence of TBII in a patient with thyrotoxicosis implies the existence of TSI, and these assays are useful in monitoring pregnant Graves' patients in whom high levels of TSI can cross the placenta and cause neonatal thyrotoxicosis. Other thyroid autoimmune responses, similar to those in autoimmune hypothyroidism (see above), occur concurrently in patients with Graves' disease. In particular, TPO antibodies occur in up to 80% of cases and serve as a readily measurable marker of autoimmunity. Because the coexisting thyroiditis can also affect thyroid function, there is no direct correlation between the level of TSI and thyroid hormone levels in Graves' disease. In the long term, spontaneous autoimmune hypothyroidism may develop in up to 15% of patients with Graves' disease.

Cytokines appear to play a major role in thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy. There is infiltration of the extraocular muscles by activated T cells; the release of cytokines such as IFN-, TNF, and IL-1 results in fibroblast activation and increased synthesis of glycosaminoglycans that trap water, thereby leading to characteristic muscle swelling. Late in the disease, there is irreversible fibrosis of the muscles. Orbital fibroblasts may be particularly sensitive to cytokines, perhaps explaining the anatomic localization of the immune response. Though the pathogenesis of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy remains unclear, there is mounting evidence that the TSH-R may be a shared autoantigen that is expressed in the orbit; this would explain the close association with autoimmune thyroid disease. Increased fat is an additional cause of retrobulbar tissue expansion. The increase in intraorbital pressure can lead to proptosis, diplopia, and optic neuropathy

Clinical Manifestations

Signs and symptoms include features that are common to any cause of thyrotoxicosis (Table 341-7) as well as those specific for Graves' disease. The clinical presentation depends on the severity of thyrotoxicosis, the duration of disease, individual susceptibility to excess thyroid hormone, and the patient's age. In the elderly, features of thyrotoxicosis may be subtle or masked, and patients may present mainly with fatigue and weight loss, a condition known as apathetic thyrotoxicosis.

Thyrotoxicosis may cause unexplained weight loss, despite an enhanced appetite, due to the increased metabolic rate. Weight gain occurs in 5% of patients, however, because of increased food intake. Other prominent features include hyperactivity, nervousness, and irritability, ultimately leading to a sense of easy fatigability in some patients. Insomnia and impaired concentration are common; apathetic thyrotoxicosis may be mistaken for depression in the elderly. Fine tremor is a frequent finding, best elicited by having patients stretch out their fingers while feeling the fingertips with the palm. Common neurologic manifestations include hyperreflexia, muscle wasting, and proximal myopathy without fasciculation. Chorea is rare. Thyrotoxicosis is sometimes associated with a form of hypokalemic periodic paralysis; this disorder is particularly common in Asian males with thyrotoxicosis, but it occurs in other ethnic groups as well.

The most common cardiovascular manifestation is sinus tachycardia, often associated with palpitations, occasionally caused by supraventricular tachycardia. The high cardiac output produces a bounding pulse, widened pulse pressure, and an aortic systolic murmur and can lead to worsening of angina or heart failure in the elderly or those with preexisting heart disease. Atrial fibrillation is more common in patients >50 years of age. Treatment of the thyrotoxic state alone converts atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm in about half of patients, suggesting the existence of an underlying cardiac problem in the remainder.

The skin is usually warm and moist, and the patient may complain of sweating and heat intolerance, particularly during warm weather. Palmar erythema, onycholysis, and, less commonly, pruritus, urticaria, and diffuse hyperpigmentation may be evident. Hair texture may become fine, and a diffuse alopecia occurs in up to 40% of patients, persisting for months after restoration of euthyroidism. Gastrointestinal transit time is decreased, leading to increased stool frequency, often with diarrhea and occasionally mild steatorrhea. Women frequently experience oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea; in men, there may be impaired sexual function and, rarely, gynecomastia. The direct effect of thyroid hormones on bone resorption leads to osteopenia in long-standing thyrotoxicosis; mild hypercalcemia occurs in up to 20% of patients, but hypercalciuria is more common. There is a small increase in fracture rate in patients with a previous history of thyrotoxicosis.

In Graves' disease, the thyroid is usually diffusely enlarged to two to three times its normal size. The consistency is firm, but less so than in MNG. There may be a thrill or bruit due to the increased vascularity of the gland and the hyperdynamic circulation.

Lid retraction, causing a staring appearance, can occur in any form of thyrotoxicosis and is the result of sympathetic overactivity. However, Graves' disease is associated with specific eye signs that comprise Graves' ophthalmopathy(Fig. 341-7A). This condition is also called thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy, as it occurs in the absence of Graves' disease in 10% of patients. Most of these individuals have autoimmune hypothyroidism or thyroid antibodies. The onset of Graves' ophthalmopathy occurs within the year before or after the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in 75% of patients but can sometimes precede or follow thyrotoxicosis by several years, accounting for some cases of euthyroid ophthalmopathy.

Some patients with Graves' disease have little clinical evidence of ophthalmopathy. However, the enlarged extraocular muscles typical of the disease, and other subtle features, can be detected in almost all patients when investigated by ultrasound or CT imaging of the orbits. Unilateral signs are found in up to 10% of patients. The earliest manifestations of ophthalmopathy are usually a sensation of grittiness, eye discomfort, and excess tearing. About one-third of patients have proptosis, best detected by visualization of the sclera between the lower border of the iris and the lower eyelid, with the eyes in the primary position. Proptosis can be measured using an exophthalmometer. In severe cases, proptosis may cause corneal exposure and damage, especially if the lids fail to close during sleep. Periorbital edema, scleral injection, and chemosis are also frequent. In 5每10% of patients, the muscle swelling is so severe that diplopia results, typically, but not exclusively, when the patient looks up and laterally. The most serious manifestation is compression of the optic nerve at the apex of the orbit, leading to papilledema; peripheral field defects; and, if left untreated, permanent loss of vision.

Many scoring systems have been used to gauge the extent and activity of the orbital changes in Graves' disease. The "NO SPECS" scheme is an acronym derived from the following eye changes:

0 = No signs or symptoms
1 = Only signs (lid retraction or lag), no symptoms
2 = Soft-tissue involvement (periorbital edema)
3 = Proptosis (>22 mm)
4 = Extraocular-muscle involvement (diplopia)
5 = Corneal involvement
6 = Sight loss
Although useful as a mnemonic, the NO SPECS scheme is inadequate to describe the eye disease fully, and patients do not necessarily progress from one class to another. When Graves' eye disease is active and severe, referral to an ophthalmologist is indicated and objective measurements are needed, such as lid-fissure width; corneal staining with fluorescein; and evaluation of extraocular muscle function (e.g., Hess chart), intraocular pressure and visual fields, acuity, and color vision.

Thyroid dermopathy occurs in <5% of patients with Graves' disease (Fig. 341-7B), almost always in the presence of moderate or severe ophthalmopathy. Although most frequent over the anterior and lateral aspects of the lower leg (hence the term pretibial myxedema), skin changes can occur at other sites, particularly after trauma. The typical lesion is a noninflamed, indurated plaque with a deep pink or purple color and an "orange skin" appearance. Nodular involvement can occur, and the condition can rarely extend over the whole lower leg and foot, mimicking elephantiasis. Thyroid acropachy refers to a form of clubbing found in <1% of patients with Graves' disease (Fig. 341-7C). It is so strongly associated with thyroid dermopathy that an alternative cause of clubbing should be sought in a Graves' patient without coincident skin and orbital involvement.

Laboratory Evaluation

Investigations used to determine the existence and cause of thyrotoxicosis are summarized in Fig. 341-8. In Graves' disease, the TSH level is suppressed and total and unbound thyroid hormone levels are increased. In 2每5% of patients (and more in areas of borderline iodine intake), only T3 is increased (T3 toxicosis). The converse state of T4 toxicosis, with elevated total and unbound T4 and normal T3 levels, is occasionally seen when hyperthyroidism is induced by excess iodine, providing surplus substrate for thyroid hormone synthesis. Measurement of TPO antibodies or TBII may be useful if the diagnosis is unclear clinically but is not needed routinely. Associated abnormalities that may cause diagnostic confusion in thyrotoxicosis include elevation of bilirubin, liver enzymes, and ferritin. Microcytic anemia and thrombocytopenia may occur.

Differential Diagnosis

Diagnosis of Graves' disease is straightforward in a patient with biochemically confirmed thyrotoxicosis, diffuse goiter on palpation, ophthalmopathy, and often a personal or family history of autoimmune disorders. For patients with thyrotoxicosis who lack these features, the most reliable diagnostic method is to measure TBII or TSI. An alternative is to undertake a radionuclide (99mTc, 123I, or 131I) scan of the thyroid, which will distinguish the diffuse, high uptake of Graves' disease from nodular thyroid disease, destructive thyroiditis, ectopic thyroid tissue, and factitious thyrotoxicosis. In secondary hyperthyroidism due to a TSH-secreting pituitary tumor, there is also a diffuse goiter. The presence of a nonsuppressed TSH level and the finding of a pituitary tumor on CT or MRI scan readily identify such patients.

Clinical features of thyrotoxicosis can mimic certain aspects of other disorders, including panic attacks, mania, pheochromocytoma, and weight loss associated with malignancy. The diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis can be easily excluded if the TSH and unbound T4 and T3 levels are normal. A normal TSH also excludes Graves' disease as a cause of diffuse goiter.

Clinical Course

Clinical features generally worsen without treatment; mortality was 10每30% before the introduction of satisfactory therapy. Some patients with mild Graves' disease experience spontaneous relapses and remissions. Rarely, there may be fluctuation between hypo- and hyperthyroidism due to changes in the functional activity of TSH-R antibodies. About 15% of patients who enter remission after treatment develop hypothyroidism 10每15 years later as a result of the destructive autoimmune process.

The clinical course of ophthalmopathy does not follow that of the thyroid disease. Ophthalmopathy typically worsens over the initial 3每6 months, followed by a plateau phase over the next 12每18 months, with spontaneous improvement, particularly in the soft tissue changes. However, the course is more fulminant in up to 5% of patients, requiring intervention in the acute phase if there is optic nerve compression or corneal ulceration. Diplopia may appear late in the disease due to fibrosis of the extraocular muscles. Some studies suggest that radioiodine treatment for hyperthyroidism worsens the eye disease in a small proportion of patients (especially smokers). Antithyroid drugs or surgery have no adverse effects on the clinical course of ophthalmopathy. Thyroid dermopathy, when it occurs, usually appears 1每2 years after the development of Graves' hyperthyroidism; it may improve spontaneously.

Treatment: Graves' Disease

The hyperthyroidism of Graves' disease is treated by reducing thyroid hormone synthesis, using antithyroid drugs, or reducing the amount of thyroid tissue with radioiodine (131I) treatment or by thyroidectomy. Antithyroid drugs are the predominant therapy in many centers in Europe and Japan, whereas radioiodine is more often the first line of treatment in North America. These differences reflect the fact that no single approach is optimal and that patients may require multiple treatments to achieve remission.

The main antithyroid drugs are the thionamides, such as propylthiouracil, carbimazole, and the active metabolite of the latter, methimazole. All inhibit the function of TPO, reducing oxidation and organification of iodide. These drugs also reduce thyroid antibody levels by mechanisms that remain unclear, and they appear to enhance rates of remission. Propylthiouracil inhibits deiodination of T4  T3. However, this effect is of minor benefit, except in the most severe thyrotoxicosis, and is offset by the much shorter half-life of this drug (90 min) compared to methimazole (6 h).

There are many variations of antithyroid drug regimens. The initial dose of carbimazole or methimazole is usually 10每20 mg every 8 or 12 h, but once-daily dosing is possible after euthyroidism is restored. Propylthiouracil is given at a dose of 100每200 mg every 6每8 h, and divided doses are usually given throughout the course. Lower doses of each drug may suffice in areas of low iodine intake. The starting dose of antithyroid drugs can be gradually reduced (titration regimen) as thyrotoxicosis improves. Alternatively, high doses may be given combined with levothyroxine supplementation (block-replace regimen) to avoid drug-induced hypothyroidism. Initial reports suggesting superior remission rates with the block-replace regimen have not been reproduced in several other trials. The titration regimen is often preferred to minimize the dose of antithyroid drug and provide an index of treatment response.

Thyroid function tests and clinical manifestations are reviewed 3每4 weeks after starting treatment, and the dose is titrated based on unbound T4 levels. Most patients do not achieve euthyroidism until 6每8 weeks after treatment is initiated. TSH levels often remain suppressed for several months and therefore do not provide a sensitive index of treatment response. The usual daily maintenance doses of antithyroid drugs in the titration regimen are 2.5每10 mg of carbimazole or methimazole and 50每100 mg of propylthiouracil. In the block-replace regimen, the initial dose of antithyroid drug is held constant, and the dose of levothyroxine is adjusted to maintain normal unbound T4 levels. When TSH suppression is alleviated, TSH levels can also be used to monitor therapy.

Maximum remission rates (up to 30每50% in some populations) are achieved by 18每24 months for the titration regimen and by 6 months for the block-replace regimen. For unclear reasons, remission rates appear to vary in different geographic regions. Patients with severe hyperthyroidism and large goiters are most likely to relapse when treatment stops, but outcomes are difficult to predict. All patients should be followed closely for relapse during the first year after treatment and at least annually thereafter.

The common side effects of antithyroid drugs are rash, urticaria, fever, and arthralgia (1每5% of patients). These may resolve spontaneously or after substituting an alternative antithyroid drug. Rare but major side effects include hepatitis; an SLE-like syndrome; and, most important, agranulocytosis (<1%). It is essential that antithyroid drugs are stopped and not restarted if a patient develops major side effects. Written instructions should be provided regarding the symptoms of possible agranulocytosis (e.g., sore throat, fever, mouth ulcers) and the need to stop treatment pending a complete blood count to confirm that agranulocytosis is not present. Management of agranulocytosis is described in Chap. 107. It is not useful to monitor blood counts prospectively, because the onset of agranulocytosis is idiosyncratic and abrupt.

Propranolol (20每40 mg every 6 h) or longer-acting beta blockers such as atenolol, may be helpful to control adrenergic symptoms, especially in the early stages before antithyroid drugs take effect. Beta blockers are also useful in patients with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, pending correction of thyrotoxicosis. The need for anticoagulation with coumadin should be considered in all patients with atrial fibrillation. If digoxin is used, increased doses are often needed in the thyrotoxic state.

Radioiodine causes progressive destruction of thyroid cells and can be used as initial treatment or for relapses after a trial of antithyroid drugs. There is a small risk of thyrotoxic crisis (see below) after radioiodine, which can be minimized by pretreatment with antithyroid drugs for at least a month before treatment. Antecedent treatment with antithyroid drugs should be considered for all elderly patients or for those with cardiac problems to deplete thyroid hormone stores before administration of radioiodine. Carbimazole or methimazole must be stopped at least 2 days before radioiodine administration to achieve optimum iodine uptake. Propylthiouracil has a prolonged radioprotective effect and should be stopped several weeks before radioiodine is given, or a larger dose of radioiodine will be necessary.

Efforts to calculate an optimal dose of radioiodine that achieves euthyroidism without a high incidence of relapse or progression to hypothyroidism have not been successful. Some patients inevitably relapse after a single dose because the biologic effects of radiation vary between individuals, and hypothyroidism cannot be uniformly avoided even using accurate dosimetry. A practical strategy is to give a fixed dose based on clinical features, such as the severity of thyrotoxicosis, the size of the goiter (increases the dose needed), and the level of radioiodine uptake (decreases the dose needed). 131I dosage generally ranges between 185 MBq (5 mCi) to 555 MBq (15 mCi). Incomplete treatment or early relapse is more common in males and in patients <40 years of age. Many authorities favor an approach aimed at thyroid ablation (as opposed to euthyroidism), given that levothyroxine replacement is straightforward and most patients ultimately progress to hypothyroidism over 5每10 years, frequently with some delay in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism.

Certain radiation safety precautions are necessary in the first few days after radioiodine treatment, but the exact guidelines vary depending on local protocols. In general, patients need to avoid close, prolonged contact with children and pregnant women for several days because of possible transmission of residual isotope and excessive exposure to radiation emanating from the gland. Rarely, there may be mild pain due to radiation thyroiditis 1每2 weeks after treatment. Hyperthyroidism can persist for 2每3 months before radioiodine takes full effect. For this reason, -adrenergic blockers or antithyroid drugs can be used to control symptoms during this interval. Persistent hyperthyroidism can be treated with a second dose of radioiodine, usually 6 months after the first dose. The risk of hypothyroidism after radioiodine depends on the dosage but is at least 10每20% in the first year and 5% per year thereafter. Patients should be informed of this possibility before treatment and require close follow-up during the first year and annual thyroid function testing.

Pregnancy and breast-feeding are absolute contraindications to radioiodine treatment, but patients can conceive safely 6 months after treatment. The presence of severe ophthalmopathy requires caution, and some authorities advocate the use of prednisone, 40 mg/d, at the time of radioiodine treatment, tapered over 2每3 months to prevent exacerbation of ophthalmopathy. The overall risk of cancer after radioiodine treatment in adults is not increased. Although many physicians avoid radioiodine in children and adolescents because of the theoretical risks of malignancy, emerging evidence suggests that radioiodine can be used safely in older children.

Subtotal or near-total thyroidectomy is an option for patients who relapse after antithyroid drugs and they prefer this treatment to radioiodine. Some experts recommend surgery in young individuals, particularly when the goiter is very large. Careful control of thyrotoxicosis with antithyroid drugs, followed by potassium iodide (3 drops SSKI orally tid), is needed prior to surgery to avoid thyrotoxic crisis and to reduce the vascularity of the gland. The major complications of surgery〞bleeding, laryngeal edema, hypoparathyroidism, and damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves〞are unusual when the procedure is performed by highly experienced surgeons. Recurrence rates in the best series are <2%, but the rate of hypothyroidism is only slightly less than that following radioiodine treatment.

The titration regimen of antithyroid drugs should be used to manage Graves' disease in pregnancy, as blocking doses of these drugs produce fetal hypothyroidism. Propylthiouracil is usually used because of relatively low transplacental transfer and its ability to block T4  T3 conversion. Also, carbimazole and methimazole have been associated with rare cases of fetal aplasia cutis and other defects, such as choanal atresia. The lowest effective dose of propylthiouracil should be given, and it is often possible to stop treatment in the last trimester because TSI tend to decline in pregnancy. Nonetheless, the transplacental transfer of these antibodies rarely causes fetal or neonatal thyrotoxicosis. Poor intrauterine growth, a fetal heart rate of >160 beats/min, and high levels of maternal TSI in the last trimester may herald this complication. Antithyroid drugs given to the mother can be used to treat the fetus and may be needed for 1每3 months after delivery, until the maternal antibodies disappear from the baby's circulation. The postpartum period is a time of major risk for relapse of Graves' disease. Breast-feeding is safe with low doses of antithyroid drugs. Graves' disease in children is usually managed with antithyroid drugs, often given as a prolonged course of the titration regimen. Surgery or radioiodine may be indicated for severe disease.

Thyrotoxic crisis, or thyroid storm, is rare and presents as a life-threatening exacerbation of hyperthyroidism, accompanied by fever, delirium, seizures, coma, vomiting, diarrhea, and jaundice. The mortality rate due to cardiac failure, arrhythmia, or hyperthermia is as high as 30%, even with treatment. Thyrotoxic crisis is usually precipitated by acute illness (e.g., stroke, infection, trauma, diabetic ketoacidosis), surgery (especially on the thyroid), or radioiodine treatment of a patient with partially treated or untreated hyperthyroidism. Management requires intensive monitoring and supportive care, identification and treatment of the precipitating cause, and measures that reduce thyroid hormone synthesis. Large doses of propylthiouracil (600 mg loading dose and 200每300 mg every 6 h) should be given orally or by nasogastric tube or per rectum; the drug's inhibitory action on T4  T3 conversion makes it the antithyroid drug of choice. One hour after the first dose of propylthiouracil, stable iodide is given to block thyroid hormone synthesis via the Wolff-Chaikoff effect (the delay allows the antithyroid drug to prevent the excess iodine from being incorporated into new hormone). A saturated solution of potassium iodide (5 drops SSKI every 6 h), or ipodate or iopanoic acid (500 mg per 12 h), may be given orally. (Sodium iodide, 0.25 g IV every 6 h, is an alternative but is not generally available.) Propranolol should also be given to reduce tachycardia and other adrenergic manifestations (40每60 mg PO every 4 h; or 2 mg IV every 4 h). Although other -adrenergic blockers can be used, high doses of propranolol decrease T4  T3 conversion, and the doses can be easily adjusted. Caution is needed to avoid acute negative inotropic effects, but controlling the heart rate is important, as some patients develop a form of high-output heart failure. Additional therapeutic measures include glucocorticoids (e.g., dexamethasone, 2 mg every 6 h), antibiotics if infection is present, cooling, oxygen, and intravenous fluids.

Ophthalmopathy requires no active treatment when it is mild or moderate, because there is usually spontaneous improvement. General measures include meticulous control of thyroid hormone levels, cessation of smoking, and an explanation of the natural history of ophthalmopathy. Discomfort can be relieved with artificial tears (e.g., 1% methylcellulose), eye ointment, and the use of dark glasses with side frames. Periorbital edema may respond to a more upright sleeping position or a diuretic. Corneal exposure during sleep can be avoided by using patches or taping the eyelids shut. Minor degrees of diplopia improve with prisms fitted to spectacles. Severe ophthalmopathy, with optic nerve involvement or chemosis resulting in corneal damage, is an emergency requiring joint management with an ophthalmologist. Short-term benefit can be gained in about two-thirds of patients by the use of high-dose glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone, 40每80 mg daily), sometimes combined with cyclosporine. Glucocorticoid doses are tapered by 5 mg every 2 weeks, but the taper often results in reemergence of congestive symptoms. Pulse therapy with IV methylprednisolone (e.g., 500每1000 mg of methylprednisolone in 250 mL of saline infused over 2 h daily for 1 week) followed by an oral regimen is also used. When glucocorticoids are ineffective, orbital decompression can be achieved by removing bone from any wall of the orbit, thereby allowing displacement of fat and swollen extraocular muscles. The transantral route is used most often, because it requires no external incision. Proptosis recedes an average of 5 mm, but there may be residual or even worsened diplopia. Once the eye disease has stabilized, surgery may be indicated for relief of diplopia and correction of the appearance. External beam radiotherapy of the orbits has been used for many years, but the efficacy of this therapy remains unclear, and it is best reserved for those who have failed or are not candidates for glucocorticoid therapy.

Thyroid dermopathy does not usually require treatment, but it can cause cosmetic problems or interfere with the fit of shoes. Surgical removal is not indicated. If necessary, treatment consists of topical, high-potency glucocorticoid ointment under an occlusive dressing. Octreotide may be beneficial in some cases.

Other Causes of Thyrotoxicosis

Destructive thyroiditis (subacute or silent thyroiditis) typically presents with a short thyrotoxic phase due to the release of preformed thyroid hormones and catabolism of Tg (see "Subacute Thyroiditis," below). True hyperthyroidism is absent, as demonstrated by a low radionuclide uptake. Circulating Tg levels are usually increased. Other causes of thyrotoxicosis with low or absent thyroid radionuclide uptake include thyrotoxicosis factitia, iodine excess, and, rarely, ectopic thyroid tissue, particularly teratomas of the ovary (struma ovarii); and functional metastatic follicular carcinoma. Whole-body radionuclide studies can demonstrate ectopic thyroid tissue, and thyrotoxicosis factitia can be distinguished from destructive thyroiditis by the clinical features and low levels of Tg. Amiodarone treatment is associated with thyrotoxicosis in up to 10% of patients, particularly in areas of low iodine intake (see below).

TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma is a rare cause of thyrotoxicosis. It can be identified by the presence of an inappropriately normal or increased TSH level in a patient with hyperthyroidism, diffuse goiter, and elevated T4 and T3 levels (Chap. 339). Elevated levels of the -subunit of TSH, released by the TSH-secreting adenoma, support this diagnosis, which can be confirmed by demonstrating the pituitary tumor on MRI or CT scan. A combination of transsphenoidal surgery, sella irradiation, and octreotide may be required to normalize TSH, because many of these tumors are large and locally invasive at the time of diagnosis. Radioiodine or antithyroid drugs can be used to control thyrotoxicosis.

Thyrotoxicosis caused by toxic MNG and hyperfunctioning solitary nodules is discussed below.
 
Thyroiditis

A clinically useful classification of thyroiditis is based on the onset and duration of disease (Table 341-8).

Table 341-8 Causes of Thyroiditis

 
 
Acute  
  Bacterial infection: especially Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterobacter  
  Fungal infection: Aspergillus, Candida, Coccidioides, Histoplasma, and Pneumocystis  
  Radiation thyroiditis after 131I treatment
  
  Amiodarone (may also be subacute or chronic) 
Subacute  
  Viral (or granulomatous) thyroiditis 
  Silent thyroiditis (including postpartum thyroiditis) 
  Mycobacterial infection 
Chronic  
  Autoimmunity: focal thyroiditis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, atrophic thyroiditis 
  Riedel's thyroiditis 
  Parasitic thyroiditis: echinococcosis, strongyloidiasis, cysticercosis 
  Traumatic: after palpation 
 

 

Acute Thyroiditis

Acute thyroiditis is rare and due to suppurative infection of the thyroid. In children and young adults, the most common cause is the presence of a piriform sinus, a remnant of the fourth branchial pouch that connects the oropharynx with the thyroid. Such sinuses are predominantly left-sided. A long-standing goiter and degeneration in a thyroid malignancy are risk factors in the elderly. The patient presents with thyroid pain, often referred to the throat or ears, and a small, tender goiter that may be asymmetric. Fever, dysphagia, and erythema over the thyroid are common, as are systemic symptoms of a febrile illness and lymphadenopathy.

The differential diagnosis of thyroid pain includes subacute or, rarely, chronic thyroiditis; hemorrhage into a cyst; malignancy including lymphoma; and, rarely, amiodarone-induced thyroiditis or amyloidosis. However, the abrupt presentation and clinical features of acute thyroiditis rarely cause confusion. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and white cell count are usually increased, but thyroid function is normal. FNA biopsy shows infiltration by polymorphonuclear leukocytes; culture of the sample can identify the organism. Caution is needed in immunocompromised patients as fungal, mycobacterial, or Pneumocystis thyroiditis can occur in this setting. Antibiotic treatment is guided initially by Gram stain and, subsequently, by cultures of the FNA biopsy. Surgery may be needed to drain an abscess, which can be localized by CT scan or ultrasound. Tracheal obstruction, septicemia, retropharyngeal abscess, mediastinitis, and jugular venous thrombosis may complicate acute thyroiditis but are uncommon with prompt use of antibiotics.

Subacute Thyroiditis

This is also termed de Quervain's thyroiditis, granulomatous thyroiditis, or viral thyroiditis. Many viruses have been implicated, including mumps, coxsackie, influenza, adenoviruses, and echoviruses, but attempts to identify the virus in an individual patient are often unsuccessful and do not influence management. The diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis is often overlooked because the symptoms can mimic pharyngitis. The peak incidence occurs at 30每50 years, and women are affected three times more frequently than men.

Pathophysiology

The thyroid shows a characteristic patchy inflammatory infiltrate with disruption of the thyroid follicles and multinucleated giant cells within some follicles. The follicular changes progress to granulomas accompanied by fibrosis. Finally, the thyroid returns to normal, usually several months after onset. During the initial phase of follicular destruction, there is release of Tg and thyroid hormones, leading to increased circulating T4 and T3 and suppression of TSH (Fig. 341-9). During this destructive phase, radioactive iodine uptake is low or undetectable. After several weeks, the thyroid is depleted of stored thyroid hormone and a phase of hypothyroidism typically occurs, with low unbound T4 (and sometimes T3) and moderately increased TSH levels. Radioactive iodine uptake returns to normal or is even increased as a result of the rise in TSH. Finally, thyroid hormone and TSH levels return to normal as the disease subsides.

Figure 341-9 Clinical Course of Subacute Thyroiditis.

 
 
 
The release of thyroid hormones is initially associated with a thyrotoxic phase and suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). A hypothyroid phase then ensues, with low T4 and TSH levels that are initially low but gradually increase. During the recovery phase, increased TSH levels combined with resolution of thyroid follicular injury leads to normalization of thyroid function, often several months after the beginning of the illness. ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; FT4, free or unbound T4.
 
 

Clinical Manifestations

The patient usually presents with a painful and enlarged thyroid, sometimes accompanied by fever. There may be features of thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism, depending on the phase of the illness. Malaise and symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection may precede the thyroid-related features by several weeks. In other patients, the onset is acute, severe, and without obvious antecedent. The patient typically complains of a sore throat, and examination reveals a small goiter that is exquisitely tender. Pain is often referred to the jaw or ear. Complete resolution is the usual outcome, but permanent hypothyroidism can occur, particularly in those with coincidental thyroid autoimmunity. A prolonged course over many months, with one or more relapses, occurs in a small percentage of patients.

Laboratory Evaluation

As depicted in (Fig. 341-9), thyroid function tests characteristically evolve through three distinct phases over about 6 months: (1) thyrotoxic phase, (2) hypothyroid phase, and (3) recovery phase. In the thyrotoxic phase, T4 and T3 levels are increased, reflecting their discharge from the damaged thyroid cells, and TSH is suppressed. The T4/T3 ratio is greater than in Graves' disease or thyroid autonomy, in which T3 is often disproportionately increased. The diagnosis is confirmed by a high ESR and low radioiodine uptake. The white blood cell count may be increased, and thyroid antibodies are negative. If the diagnosis is in doubt, FNA biopsy may be useful, particularly to distinguish unilateral involvement from bleeding into a cyst or neoplasm.

Treatment: Subacute Thyroiditis

Relatively large doses of aspirin (e.g., 600 mg every 4每6 h) or NSAIDs are sufficient to control symptoms in many cases. If this treatment is inadequate, or if the patient has marked local or systemic symptoms, glucocorticoids should be given. The usual starting dose is 40每60 mg prednisone, depending on severity. The dose is gradually tapered over 6每8 weeks, in response to improvement in symptoms and the ESR. If a relapse occurs during glucocorticoid withdrawal, treatment should be started again and withdrawn more gradually. In these patients, it is useful to wait until the radioactive iodine uptake normalizes before stopping treatment. Thyroid function should be monitored every 2每4 weeks using TSH and unbound T4 levels. Symptoms of thyrotoxicosis improve spontaneously but may be ameliorated by -adrenergic blockers; antithyroid drugs play no role in treatment of the thyrotoxic phase. Levothyroxine replacement may be needed if the hypothyroid phase is prolonged, but doses should be low enough (50 to 100 g daily) to allow TSH-mediated recovery.

Silent Thyroiditis

Painless thyroiditis, or "silent" thyroiditis, occurs in patients with underlying autoimmune thyroid disease. It has a clinical course similar to that of subacute thyroiditis, except that there is little or no thyroid tenderness. The condition occurs in up to 5% of women 3每6 months after pregnancy and is then termed postpartum thyroiditis. Typically, patients have a brief phase of thyrotoxicosis lasting 2每4 weeks, followed by hypothyroidism for 4每12 weeks, and then resolution; often, however, only one phase is apparent. The condition is associated with the presence of TPO antibodies antepartum, and it is three times more common in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus. As in subacute thyroiditis, the radioactive iodine uptake is initially suppressed. In addition to the painless goiter, silent thyroiditis can be distinguished from subacute thyroiditis by a normal ESR and the presence of TPO antibodies. Glucocorticoid treatment is not indicated for silent thyroiditis. Severe thyrotoxic symptoms can be managed with a brief course of propranolol, 20每40 mg three or four times daily. Thyroxine replacement may be needed for the hypothyroid phase but should be withdrawn after 6每9 months, as recovery is the rule. Annual follow-up thereafter is recommended, because a proportion of these individuals develop permanent hypothyroidism. The condition may recur in subsequent pregnancies.

Drug-Induced Thyroiditis

Patients receiving cytokines such as IFN- or IL-2 may develop painless thyroiditis. IFN-, which is used to treat chronic hepatitis B or C and hematologic and skin malignancies, causes thyroid dysfunction in up to 5% of treated patients. It has been associated with painless thyroiditis, hypothyroidism, and Graves' disease, and is most common in women with TPO antibodies prior to treatment. For discussion of amiodarone, see "Amiodarone Effects on Thyroid Function," below.

Chronic Thyroiditis

Focal thyroiditis is present in 20每40% of euthyroid autopsy cases and is associated with serologic evidence of autoimmunity, particularly the presence of TPO antibodies. These antibodies are 4每10 times more common in otherwise healthy women than men. The most common clinically apparent cause of chronic thyroiditis is Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune disorder that often presents as a firm or hard goiter of variable size (see above). Riedel's thyroiditis is a rare disorder that typically occurs in middle-aged women. It presents with an insidious, painless goiter with local symptoms due to compression of the esophagus, trachea, neck veins, or recurrent laryngeal nerves. Dense fibrosis disrupts normal gland architecture and can extend outside the thyroid capsule. Despite these extensive histologic changes, thyroid dysfunction is uncommon. The goiter is hard, nontender, often asymmetric, and fixed, leading to suspicion of a malignancy. Diagnosis requires open biopsy as FNA biopsy is usually inadequate. Treatment is directed to surgical relief of compressive symptoms. Tamoxifen may also be beneficial. There is an association between Riedel's thyroiditis and idiopathic fibrosis at other sites (retroperitoneum, mediastinum, biliary tree, lung, and orbit).
 
Sick Euthyroid Syndrome

Any acute, severe illness can cause abnormalities of circulating TSH or thyroid hormone levels in the absence of underlying thyroid disease, making these measurements potentially misleading. The major cause of these hormonal changes is the release of cytokines such as IL-6. Unless a thyroid disorder is strongly suspected, the routine testing of thyroid function should be avoided in acutely ill patients.

The most common hormone pattern in sick euthyroid syndrome (SES) is a decrease in total and unbound T3 levels (low T3 syndrome) with normal levels of T4 and TSH. The magnitude of the fall in T3 correlates with the severity of the illness. T4 conversion to T3 via peripheral deiodination is impaired, leading to increased reverse T3 (rT3). Despite this effect, decreased clearance rather than increased production is the major basis for increased rT3. Also, T4 is alternately metabolized to the hormonally inactive T3 sulfate. It is generally assumed that this low T3 state is adaptive, because it can be induced in normal individuals by fasting. Teleologically, the fall in T3 may limit catabolism in starved or ill patients.

Very sick patients may exhibit a dramatic fall in total T4 and T3 levels (low T4 syndrome). This state has a poor prognosis. A key factor in the fall in T4 levels is altered binding to TBG. T4 assays usually demonstrate a normal unbound T4 level in such patients, depending on the assay method used. Fluctuation in TSH levels also creates challenges in the interpretation of thyroid function in sick patients. TSH levels may range from <0.1 to >20 mIU/L; these alterations reverse after recovery, confirming the absence of underlying thyroid disease. A rise in cortisol or administration of glucocorticoids may provide a partial explanation for decreased TSH levels. The exact mechanisms underlying the subnormal TSH seen in 10% of sick patients and the increased TSH seen in 5% remain unclear but may be mediated by cytokines including IL-12 and IL-18.

Any severe illness can induce changes in thyroid hormone levels, but certain disorders exhibit a distinctive pattern of abnormalities. Acute liver disease is associated with an initial rise in total (but not unbound) T3 and T4 levels, due to TBG release; these levels become subnormal with progression to liver failure. A transient increase in total and unbound T4 levels, usually with a normal T3 level, is seen in 5每30% of acutely ill psychiatric patients. TSH values may be transiently low, normal, or high in these patients. In the early stage of HIV infection, T3 and T4 levels rise, even if there is weight loss. T3 levels fall with progression to AIDS, but TSH usually remains normal. Renal disease is often accompanied by low T3 concentrations, but with normal rather than increased rT3 levels, due to an unknown factor that increases uptake of rT3 into the liver.

The diagnosis of SES is challenging. Historic information may be limited, and patients often have multiple metabolic derangements. Useful features to consider include previous history of thyroid disease and thyroid function tests, evaluation of the severity and time course of the patient's acute illness, documentation of medications that may affect thyroid function or thyroid hormone levels, and measurements of rT3 together with unbound thyroid hormones and TSH. The diagnosis of SES is frequently presumptive, given the clinical context and pattern of laboratory values; only resolution of the test results with clinical recovery can clearly establish this disorder. Treatment of SES with thyroid hormone (T4 and/or T3) is controversial, but most authorities recommend monitoring the patient's thyroid function tests during recovery, without administering thyroid hormone, unless there is historic or clinical evidence suggestive of hypothyroidism. Sufficiently large randomized controlled trials using thyroid hormone are unlikely to resolve this therapeutic controversy in the near future, because clinical presentations and outcomes are highly variable.
 
Amiodarone Effects on Thyroid Function

Amiodarone is a commonly used type III antiarrhythmic agent (Chap. 233). It is structurally related to thyroid hormone and contains 39% iodine by weight. Thus, typical doses of amiodarone (200 mg/d) are associated with very high iodine intake, leading to greater than fortyfold increases in plasma and urinary iodine levels. Moreover, because amiodarone is stored in adipose tissue, high iodine levels persist for >6 months after discontinuation of the drug. Amiodarone inhibits deiodinase activity, and its metabolites function as weak antagonists of thyroid hormone action. Amiodarone has the following effects on thyroid function: (1) acute, transient suppression of thyroid function; (2) hypothyroidism in patients susceptible to the inhibitory effects of a high iodine load; and (3) thyrotoxicosis that may be caused by either a Jod-Basedow effect from the iodine load, in the setting of MNG or incipient Graves' disease, or a thyroiditis-like condition.

The initiation of amiodarone treatment is associated with a transient decrease of T4 levels, reflecting the inhibitory effect of iodine on T4 release. Soon thereafter, most individuals escape from iodide-dependent suppression of the thyroid (Wolff-Chaikoff effect), and the inhibitory effects on deiodinase activity and thyroid hormone receptor action become predominant. These events lead to the following pattern of thyroid function tests: increased T4, decreased T3, increased rT3, and a transient TSH increase (up to 20 mIU/L). TSH levels normalize or are slightly suppressed within 1每3 months.

The incidence of hypothyroidism from amiodarone varies geographically, apparently correlating with iodine intake. Hypothyroidism occurs in up to 13% of amiodarone-treated patients in iodine-replete countries, such as the United States, but is less common (<6% incidence) in areas of lower iodine intake, such as Italy or Spain. The pathogenesis appears to involve an inability of the thyroid gland to escape from the Wolff-Chaikoff effect in autoimmune thyroiditis. Consequently, amiodarone-associated hypothyroidism is more common in women and individuals with positive TPO antibodies. It is usually unnecessary to discontinue amiodarone for this side effect, because levothyroxine can be used to normalize thyroid function. TSH levels should be monitored, because T4 levels are often increased for the reasons described above.

The management of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) is complicated by the fact that there are different causes of thyrotoxicosis and because the increased thyroid hormone levels exacerbate underlying arrhythmias and coronary artery disease. Amiodarone treatment causes thyrotoxicosis in 10% of patients living in areas of low iodine intake and in 2% of patients in regions of high iodine intake. There are two major forms of AIT, although some patients have features of both. Type 1 AIT is associated with an underlying thyroid abnormality (preclinical Graves' disease or nodular goiter). Thyroid hormone synthesis becomes excessive as a result of increased iodine exposure (Jod-Basedow phenomenon). Type 2 AIT occurs in individuals with no intrinsic thyroid abnormalities and is the result of drug-induced lysosomal activation leading to destructive thyroiditis with histiocyte accumulation in the thyroid; the incidence rises as cumulative amiodarone dosage increases. Mild forms of type 2 AIT can resolve spontaneously or can occasionally lead to hypothyroidism. Color-flow doppler thyroid scanning shows increased vascularity in type 1 AIT but decreased vascularity in type 2 AIT. Thyroid scintiscans are difficult to interpret in this setting because the high endogenous iodine levels diminish tracer uptake. However, the presence of normal or rarely increased uptake favors type 1 AIT.

In AIT, the drug should be stopped, if possible, although this is often impractical because of the underlying cardiac disorder. Discontinuation of amiodarone will not have an acute effect because of its storage and prolonged half-life. High doses of antithyroid drugs can be used in type 1 AIT but are often ineffective. In type 2 AIT, oral contrast agents, such as sodium ipodate (500 mg/d) or sodium tyropanoate (500 mg, 1每2 doses/d), rapidly reduce T4 and T3 levels, decrease T4  T3 conversion, and may block tissue uptake of thyroid hormones. Potassium perchlorate, 200 mg every 6 h, has been used to reduce thyroidal iodide content. Perchlorate treatment has been associated with agranulocytosis, though the risk appears relatively low with short-term use. Glucocorticoids, as administered for subacute thyroiditis, have modest benefit in type 2 AIT. Lithium blocks thyroid hormone release and can also provide some benefit. Near-total thyroidectomy rapidly decreases thyroid hormone levels and may be the most effective long-term solution if the patient can undergo the procedure safely.
 
Thyroid Function in Pregnancy

Five factors alter thyroid function in pregnancy: (1) the transient increase in hCG during the first trimester, which stimulates the TSH-R; (2) the estrogen-induced rise in TBG during the first trimester, which is sustained during pregnancy; (3) alterations in the immune system, leading to the onset, exacerbation, or amelioration of an underlying autoimmune thyroid disease (see above); (4) increased thyroid hormone metabolism by the placenta; and (5) increased urinary iodide excretion, which can cause impaired thyroid hormone production in areas of marginal iodine sufficiency. Women with a precarious iodine intake (<50 g/d) are most at risk of developing a goiter during pregnancy, and iodine supplementation should be considered to prevent maternal and fetal hypothyroidism and the development of neonatal goiter.

The rise in circulating hCG levels during the first trimester is accompanied by a reciprocal fall in TSH that persists into the middle of pregnancy. This appears to reflect weak binding of hCG, which is present at very high levels, to the TSH-R. Rare individuals have been described with variant TSH-R sequences that enhance hCG binding and TSH-R activation. Human chorionic gonadotropin-induced changes in thyroid function can result in transient gestational hyperthyroidism and/or hyperemesis gravidarum, a condition characterized by severe nausea and vomiting and risk of volume depletion. Antithyroid drugs are rarely needed, and parenteral fluid replacement usually suffices until the condition resolves.

Maternal hypothyroidism occurs in 2每3% of women of child-bearing age and is associated with increased risk of developmental delay in the offspring. Consequently, TSH screening for hypothyroidism is indicated in early pregnancy and should be considered in women who are planning pregnancy, particularly if they have a goiter or strong family history of autoimmune thyroid disease. Thyroid hormone requirements are increased by 25每50 g/d during pregnancy.
 
Goiter and Nodular Thyroid Disease

Goiter refers to an enlarged thyroid gland. Biosynthetic defects, iodine deficiency, autoimmune disease, and nodular diseases can each lead to goiter, though by different mechanisms. Biosynthetic defects and iodine deficiency are associated with reduced efficiency of thyroid hormone synthesis, leading to increased TSH, which stimulates thyroid growth as a compensatory mechanism to overcome the block in hormone synthesis. Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis are also associated with goiter. In Graves' disease, the goiter results mainly from the TSH-R每mediated effects of TSI. The goitrous form of Hashimoto's thyroiditis occurs because of acquired defects in hormone synthesis, leading to elevated levels of TSH and its consequent growth effects. Lymphocytic infiltration and immune system每induced growth factors also contribute to thyroid enlargement in Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Nodular disease is characterized by the disordered growth of thyroid cells, often combined with the gradual development of fibrosis. Because the management of goiter depends on the etiology, the detection of thyroid enlargement on physical examination should prompt further evaluation to identify its cause.

Nodular thyroid disease is common, occurring in about 3每7% of adults when assessed by physical examination. Using more sensitive techniques, such as ultrasound, it is present in >25% of adults. Thyroid nodules may be solitary or multiple, and they may be functional or nonfunctional.

Diffuse Nontoxic (Simple) Goiter

Etiology and Pathogenesis

When diffuse enlargement of the thyroid occurs in the absence of nodules and hyperthyroidism, it is referred to as a diffuse nontoxic goiter. This is sometimes called simple goiter, because of the absence of nodules, or colloid goiter, because of the presence of uniform follicles that are filled with colloid. Worldwide, diffuse goiter is most commonly caused by iodine deficiency and is termed endemic goiter when it affects >5% of the population. In nonendemic regions, sporadic goiter occurs, and the cause is usually unknown. Thyroid enlargement in teenagers is sometimes referred to as juvenile goiter. In general, goiter is more common in women than men, probably because of the greater prevalence of underlying autoimmune disease and the increased iodine demands associated with pregnancy.

In iodine-deficient areas, thyroid enlargement reflects a compensatory effort to trap iodide and produce sufficient hormone under conditions in which hormone synthesis is relatively inefficient. Somewhat surprisingly, TSH levels are usually normal or only slightly increased, suggesting increased sensitivity to TSH or activation of other pathways that lead to thyroid growth. Iodide appears to have direct actions on thyroid vasculature and may indirectly affect growth through vasoactive substances such as endothelins and nitric oxide. Endemic goiter is also caused by exposure to environmental goitrogens such as cassava root, which contains a thiocyanate; vegetables of the Cruciferae family (known as cruciferous vegetables) (e.g., brussels sprout, cabbage, and cauliflower); and milk from regions where goitrogens are present in grass. Though relatively rare, inherited defects in thyroid hormone synthesis lead to a diffuse nontoxic goiter. Abnormalities at each step in hormone synthesis, including iodide transport (NIS), Tg synthesis, organification and coupling (TPO), and the regeneration of iodide (dehalogenase), have been described.

Clinical Manifestations and Diagnosis

If thyroid function is preserved, most goiters are asymptomatic. Spontaneous hemorrhage into a cyst or nodule may cause the sudden onset of localized pain and swelling. Examination of a diffuse goiter reveals a symmetrically enlarged, nontender, generally soft gland without palpable nodules. Goiter is defined, somewhat arbitrarily, as a lateral lobe with a volume greater than the thumb of the individual being examined. If the thyroid is markedly enlarged, it can cause tracheal or esophageal compression. These features are unusual, however, in the absence of nodular disease and fibrosis. Substernal goiter may obstruct the thoracic inlet. Pemberton's sign refers to symptoms of faintness with evidence of facial congestion and external jugular venous obstruction when the arms are raised above the head, a maneuver that draws the thyroid into the thoracic inlet. Respiratory flow measurements and CT or MRI should be used to evaluate substernal goiter in patients with obstructive signs or symptoms.

Thyroid function tests should be performed in all patients with goiter to exclude thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism. It is not unusual, particularly in iodine deficiency, to find a low total T4, with normal T3 and TSH, reflecting enhanced T4 T3 conversion. A low TSH with a normal free T3 and free T4, particularly in older patients, suggests the possibility of thyroid autonomy or undiagnosed Graves' disease, and is termed subclinical thyrotoxicosis. The benefit of treatment (typically with radioiodine) in subclinical thyrotoxicosis, versus follow-up and implementing treatment if free T3 or free T4 levels become abnormal, is unclear, but treatment is increasingly recommended in the elderly to reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation and bone loss. TPO antibodies may be useful to identify patients at increased risk of autoimmune thyroid disease. Low urinary iodine levels (<10 g/dL) support a diagnosis of iodine deficiency. Thyroid scanning is not generally necessary but will reveal increased uptake in iodine deficiency and most cases of dyshormonogenesis. Ultrasound is not generally indicated in the evaluation of diffuse goiter unless a nodule is palpable on physical examination.

Treatment: Diffuse Nontoxic (Simple) Goiter

Iodine or thyroid hormone replacement induces variable regression of goiter in iodine deficiency, depending on how long it has been present and the degree of fibrosis that has developed. Because of the possibility of underlying thyroid autonomy, caution should be exercised when instituting suppressive thyroxine therapy in patients with goiter, particularly if the baseline TSH is in the low to normal range. In younger patients, the dose of levothyroxine can be started at 100 mcg/d and adjusted to suppress the TSH into the low to normal, but detectable, range. Treatment of elderly patients should be initiated at 50 mcg/d. The efficacy of suppressive treatment is greater in younger patients and for those with soft goiters. Significant regression is usually seen within 3每6 months of treatment; after this time, it is unlikely to occur. In older patients and in those with some degree of nodular disease or fibrosis, fewer than one-third demonstrate significant shrinkage of the goiter. Surgery is rarely indicated for diffuse goiter. Exceptions include documented evidence of tracheal compression or obstruction of the thoracic outlet, which are more likely to be associated with substernal multinodular goiters (see below). Subtotal or near-total thyroidectomy for these or cosmetic reasons should be performed by an experienced surgeon to minimize complication rates. Surgery should be followed by replacement with levothyroxine, with the aim of keeping the TSH level at the lower end of the reference range to prevent regrowth of the goiter. Radioiodine reduces goiter size by about 50% in the majority of patients over 6每12 months. It is rarely associated with transient acute swelling of the thyroid, which is usually inconsequential unless there is severe tracheal narrowing. If they are not treated with levothyroxine, patients should be followed after radioiodine treatment for the possible development of hypothyroidism.

Nontoxic Multinodular Goiter

Etiology and Pathogenesis

Depending on the population studied, MNG occurs in up to 12% of adults. MNG is more common in women than men and increases in prevalence with age. It is more common in iodine-deficient regions but also occurs in regions of iodine sufficiency, reflecting multiple genetic, autoimmune, and environmental influences on the pathogenesis.

There is typically wide variation in nodule size. Histology reveals a spectrum of morphologies ranging from hypercellular regions to cystic areas filled with colloid. Fibrosis is often extensive, and areas of hemorrhage or lymphocytic infiltration may be seen. Using molecular techniques, most nodules within a MNG are polyclonal in origin, suggesting a hyperplastic response to locally produced growth factors and cytokines. TSH, which is usually not elevated, may play a permissive or contributory role. Monoclonal lesions also occur within a MNG, reflecting mutations in genes that confer a selective growth advantage to the progenitor cell.

Clinical Manifestations

Most patients with nontoxic MNG are asymptomatic and euthyroid. MNG typically develops over many years and is detected on routine physical examination or when an individual notices an enlargement in the neck. If the goiter is large enough, it can ultimately lead to compressive symptoms including difficulty swallowing, respiratory distress (tracheal compression), or plethora (venous congestion); but these symptoms are uncommon. Symptomatic MNGs are usually extraordinarily large and/or develop fibrotic areas that cause compression. Sudden pain in a MNG is usually caused by hemorrhage into a nodule but should raise the possibility of invasive malignancy. Hoarseness, reflecting laryngeal nerve involvement, also suggests malignancy.

Diagnosis

On examination, thyroid architecture is distorted, and multiple nodules of varying size can be appreciated. Because many nodules are deeply embedded in thyroid tissue or reside in posterior or substernal locations, it is not possible to palpate all nodules. A TSH level should be measured to exclude subclinical hyper- or hypothyroidism, but thyroid function is usually normal. Tracheal deviation is common, but compression must usually exceed 70% of the tracheal diameter before there is significant airway compromise. Pulmonary function testing can be used to assess the functional effects of compression and to detect tracheomalacia, which characteristically causes inspiratory stridor. CT or MRI can be used to evaluate the anatomy of the goiter and the extent of substernal extension, which is often much greater than is apparent on physical examination. A barium swallow may reveal the extent of esophageal compression. The risk of malignancy in MNG is similar to that in solitary nodules. Ultrasonography can be used to identify which nodules should be biopsied, including large, dominant nodules or those with sonographic characteristics suggestive of malignancy (e.g., microcalcifications, hypoechogenicity, increased vascularity).

Treatment: Nontoxic Multinodular Goiter

Most nontoxic MNGs can be managed conservatively. T4 suppression is rarely effective for reducing goiter size and introduces the risk of subclinical or overt thyrotoxicosis, particularly if there is underlying autonomy or if it develops during treatment. If levothyroxine is used, it should be started at low doses (50 g) and advanced gradually while monitoring the TSH level to avoid excessive suppression. Contrast agents and other iodine-containing substances should be avoided because of the risk of inducing the Jod-Basedow effect, characterized by enhanced thyroid hormone production by autonomous nodules. Radioiodine is used with increasing frequency because it can decrease goiter size and may selectively ablate regions of autonomy. Dosage of 131I depends on the size of the goiter and radioiodine uptake but is usually about 3.7 MBq (0.1 mCi) per gram of tissue, corrected for uptake [typical dose 370每1070 MBq (10 to 29 mCi)]. Repeat treatment may be needed and effectiveness may be increased by concurrent administration of recombinant TSH. It is possible to achieve a 40每50% reduction in goiter size in most patients. Earlier concerns about radiation-induced thyroid swelling and tracheal compression have diminished; studies have shown this complication to be rare. When acute compression occurs, glucocorticoid treatment or surgery may be needed. Radiation-induced hypothyroidism is less common than after treatment for Graves' disease. However, posttreatment autoimmune thyrotoxicosis may occur in up to 5% of patients treated for nontoxic MNG. Surgery remains highly effective but is not without risk, particularly in older patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease.

Toxic Multinodular Goiter

The pathogenesis of toxic MNG appears to be similar to that of nontoxic MNG; the major difference is the presence of functional autonomy in toxic MNG. The molecular basis for autonomy in toxic MNG remains unknown. As in nontoxic goiters, many nodules are polyclonal, while others are monoclonal and vary in their clonal origins. Genetic abnormalities known to confer functional autonomy, such as activating TSH-R or Gs mutations (see below), are not usually found in the autonomous regions of toxic MNG goiter.

In addition to features of goiter, the clinical presentation of toxic MNG includes subclinical hyperthyroidism or mild thyrotoxicosis. The patient is usually elderly and may present with atrial fibrillation or palpitations, tachycardia, nervousness, tremor, or weight loss. Recent exposure to iodine, from contrast dyes or other sources, may precipitate or exacerbate thyrotoxicosis. The TSH level is low. The T4 level may be normal or minimally increased; T3 is often elevated to a greater degree than T4. Thyroid scan shows heterogeneous uptake with multiple regions of increased and decreased uptake; 24-hour uptake of radioiodine may not be increased.

Treatment: Toxic Multinodular Goiter

The management of toxic MNG is challenging. Antithyroid drugs, often in combination with beta blockers, can normalize thyroid function and address clinical features of thyrotoxicosis. This treatment, however, often stimulates the growth of the goiter, and in contrast to Graves' disease, spontaneous remission does not occur. Radioiodine can be used to treat areas of autonomy as well as to decrease the mass of the goiter. Usually, however, some degree of autonomy remains, presumably because multiple autonomous regions emerge as soon as others are treated. Nonetheless, a trial of radioiodine should be considered before subjecting patients, many of whom are elderly, to surgery. Surgery provides definitive treatment of underlying thyrotoxicosis as well as goiter. Patients should be rendered euthyroid using an antithyroid drug before operation.

Hyperfunctioning Solitary Nodule

A solitary, autonomously functioning thyroid nodule is referred to as toxic adenoma. The pathogenesis of this disorder has been unraveled by demonstrating the functional effects of mutations that stimulate the TSH-R signaling pathway. Most patients with solitary hyperfunctioning nodules have acquired somatic, activating mutations in the TSH-R (Fig. 341-10). These mutations, located primarily in the receptor transmembrane domain, induce constitutive receptor coupling to GS, increasing cyclic AMP levels and leading to enhanced thyroid follicular cell proliferation and function. Less commonly, somatic mutations are identified in GS. These mutations, which are similar to those seen in McCune-Albright syndrome (Chap. 347) or in a subset of somatotrope adenomas (Chap. 339), impair GTP hydrolysis, also causing constitutive activation of the cyclic AMP signaling pathway. In most series, activating mutations in either the TSH-R or the GS subunit genes are identified in >90% of patients with solitary hyperfunctioning nodules.

Figure 341-10 Activating Mutations of the TSH-R.

 
 
 
Mutations (*) that activate the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSH-R) reside mainly in transmembrane 5 and intracellular loop 3, though mutations have occurred in a variety of different locations. The effect of these mutations is to induce conformational changes that mimic TSH binding, thereby leading to coupling to stimulatory G protein (GS) and activation of adenylate cyclase (AC), an enzyme that generates cyclic AMP.
 
 

Thyrotoxicosis is usually mild. The disorder is suggested by the presence of the thyroid nodule, which is generally large enough to be palpable, and by the absence of clinical features suggestive of Graves' disease or other causes of thyrotoxicosis. A thyroid scan provides a definitive diagnostic test, demonstrating focal uptake in the hyperfunctioning nodule and diminished uptake in the remainder of the gland, as activity of the normal thyroid is suppressed.

Treatment: Hyperfunctioning Solitary Nodule

Radioiodine ablation is usually the treatment of choice. Because normal thyroid function is suppressed, 131I is concentrated in the hyperfunctioning nodule with minimal uptake and damage to normal thyroid tissue. Relatively large radioiodine doses [e.g., 370每1110 MBq (10每29.9 mCi)131I] have been shown to correct thyrotoxicosis in about 75% of patients within 3 months. Hypothyroidism occurs in <10% of those patients over the next 5 years. Surgical resection is also effective and is usually limited to enucleation of the adenoma or lobectomy, thereby preserving thyroid function and minimizing risk of hypoparathyroidism or damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves. Medical therapy using antithyroid drugs and beta blockers can normalize thyroid function but is not an optimal long-term treatment. Using ultrasound guidance, repeated ethanol injections, or percutaneous radiofrequency thermal ablation have been used successfully in some centers to ablate hyperfunctioning nodules, and these techniques have also been used to reduce the size of nonfunctioning thyroid nodules.
 
Benign Neoplasms

The various types of benign thyroid nodules are listed in Table 341-9. These lesions are common (5每10% adults), particularly when assessed by sensitive techniques such as ultrasound. The risk of malignancy is very low for macrofollicular adenomas and normofollicular adenomas. Microfollicular, trabecular, and H邦rthle cell variants raise greater concern, and the histology is more difficult to interpret. About one-third of palpable nodules are thyroid cysts. These may be recognized by their ultrasound appearance or based on aspiration of large amounts of pink or straw-colored fluid (colloid). Many are mixed cystic/solid lesions, in which case it is desirable to aspirate cellular components under ultrasound or harvest cells after cytospin of cyst fluid. Cysts frequently recur, even after repeated aspiration, and may require surgical excision if they are large or if the cytology is suspicious. Sclerosis has been used with variable success but is often painful and may be complicated by infiltration of the sclerosing agent.

The treatment approach for benign nodules is similar to that for MNG. TSH suppression with levothyroxine decreases the size of about 30% of nodules and may prevent further growth. If a nodule has not decreased in size after 6每12 months of suppressive therapy, treatment should be discontinued because little benefit is likely to accrue from long-term treatment; the risk of iatrogenic subclinical thyrotoxicosis should also be considered.
 
Thyroid Cancer

Thyroid carcinoma is the most common malignancy of the endocrine system. Malignant tumors derived from the follicular epithelium are classified according to histologic features. Differentiated tumors, such as papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) or follicular thyroid cancer (FTC), are often curable, and the prognosis is good for patients identified with early-stage disease. In contrast, anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is aggressive, responds poorly to treatment, and is associated with a bleak prognosis.

The incidence of thyroid cancer (9/100,000 per year) increases with age, plateauing after about age 50 (Fig. 341-11). Age is also an important prognostic factor〞thyroid cancer at a young age (<20) or in older persons (>45) is associated with a worse prognosis. Thyroid cancer is twice as common in women as men, but male gender is associated with a worse prognosis. Additional important risk factors include a history of childhood head or neck irradiation, large nodule size (4 cm), evidence for local tumor fixation or invasion into lymph nodes, and the presence of metastases (Table 341-10).

Several unique features of thyroid cancer facilitate its management: (1) thyroid nodules are readily palpable, allowing early detection and biopsy by FNA; (2) iodine radioisotopes can be used to diagnose (123I) and treat (131I) differentiated thyroid cancer, reflecting the unique uptake of this anion by the thyroid gland; and (3) serum markers allow the detection of residual or recurrent disease, including the use of Tg levels for PTC and FTC and calcitonin for medullary thyroid cancer (MTC).

Classification

Thyroid neoplasms can arise in each of the cell types that populate the gland, including thyroid follicular cells, calcitonin-producing C cells, lymphocytes, and stromal and vascular elements, as well as metastases from other sites (Table 341-9). The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) has designated a staging system using the TNM classification (Table 341-11). Several other classification and staging systems are also widely used, some of which place greater emphasis on histologic features or risk factors such as age or gender.

Pathogenesis and Genetic Basis

Radiation

Early studies of the pathogenesis of thyroid cancer focused on the role of external radiation, which predisposes to chromosomal breaks, leading to genetic rearrangements and loss of tumor-suppressor genes. External radiation of the mediastinum, face, head, and neck region was administered in the past to treat an array of conditions, including acne and enlargement of the thymus, tonsils, and adenoids. Radiation exposure increases the risk of benign and malignant thyroid nodules, is associated with multicentric cancers, and shifts the incidence of thyroid cancer to an earlier age group. Radiation from nuclear fallout also increases the risk of thyroid cancer. Children seem more predisposed to the effects of radiation than adults. Of note, radiation derived from 131I therapy appears to contribute minimal increased risk of thyroid cancer.

TSH and Growth Factors

Many differentiated thyroid cancers express TSH receptors and, therefore, remain responsive to TSH. This observation provides the rationale for T4 suppression of TSH in patients with thyroid cancer. Residual expression of TSH receptors also allows TSH-stimulated uptake of 131I therapy (see below).

Oncogenes and Tumor-Suppressor Genes

Thyroid cancers are monoclonal in origin, consistent with the idea that they originate as a consequence of mutations that confer a growth advantage to a single cell. In addition to increased rates of proliferation, some thyroid cancers exhibit impaired apoptosis and features that enhance invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Thyroid neoplasms have been analyzed for a variety of genetic alterations, but without clear evidence of an ordered acquisition of somatic mutations as they progress from the benign to the malignant state. On the other hand, certain mutations are relatively specific for thyroid neoplasia, some of which correlate with histologic classification (Table 341-12).

As described above, activating mutations of the TSH-R and the GS subunit are associated with autonomously functioning nodules. Though these mutations induce thyroid cell growth, this type of nodule is almost always benign.

Activation of the RET-RAS-BRAF signaling pathway is seen in most PTCs, though the types of mutations are heterogeneous. A variety of rearrangements involving the RET gene on chromosome 10 brings this receptor tyrosine kinase under the control of other promoters, leading to receptor overexpression. RET rearrangements occur in 20每40% of PTCs in different series and were observed with increased frequency in tumors developing after the Chernobyl radiation accident. Rearrangements in PTC have also been observed for another tyrosine kinase gene, TRK1, which is located on chromosome 1. To date, the identification of PTC with RET or TRK1 rearrangements has not proven useful for predicting prognosis or treatment responses. BRAF mutations appear to be the most common genetic alteration in PTC. These mutations activate the kinase, which stimulates the mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade. RAS mutations, which also stimulate the MAPK cascade, are found in about 20每30% of thyroid neoplasms, including both PTC and FTC. Of note, simultaneous RET, BRAF, and RAS mutations do not occur in the same tumor, suggesting that activation of the MAPK cascade is critical for tumor development, independent of the step that initiates the cascade.

RAS mutations also occur in FTCs. In addition, a rearrangement of the thyroid developmental transcription factor PAX8 with the nuclear receptor PPAR is identified in a significant fraction of FTCs. Loss of heterozygosity of 3p or 11q, consistent with deletions of tumor-suppressor genes, is also common in FTCs.

Most of the mutations seen in differentiated thyroid cancers have also been detected in ATCs. BRAF mutations are seen in up to 50% of ATCs. Mutations in CTNNB1, which encodes -catenin, occur in about two-thirds of ATCs, but not in PTC or FTC. Mutations of the tumor suppressor p53 also play an important role in the development of ATC. Because p53 plays a role in cell cycle surveillance, DNA repair, and apoptosis, its loss may contribute to the rapid acquisition of genetic instability as well as poor treatment responses (Chap. 84) (Table 341-12).

The role of molecular diagnostics in the clinical management of thyroid cancer is under investigation. In principle, analyses of specific mutations might aid in classification, prognosis, or choice of treatment. However, there is no clear evidence to date that this information alters clinical decision making.

MTC, when associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2, harbors an inherited mutation of the RET gene. Unlike the rearrangements of RET seen in PTC, the mutations in MEN2 are point mutations that induce constitutive activity of the tyrosine kinase (Chap. 351). MTC is preceded by hyperplasia of the C cells, raising the likelihood that as-yet-unidentified "second hits" lead to cellular transformation. A subset of sporadic MTC contain somatic mutations that activate RET.

Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer

Papillary

PTC is the most common type of thyroid cancer, accounting for 70每90% of well-differentiated thyroid malignancies. Microscopic PTC is present in up to 25% of thyroid glands at autopsy, but most of these lesions are very small (several millimeters) and are not clinically significant. Characteristic cytologic features of PTC help make the diagnosis by FNA or after surgical resection; these include psammoma bodies, cleaved nuclei with an "orphan-Annie" appearance caused by large nucleoli, and the formation of papillary structures.

PTC tends to be multifocal and to invade locally within the thyroid gland as well as through the thyroid capsule and into adjacent structures in the neck. It has a propensity to spread via the lymphatic system but can metastasize hematogenously as well, particularly to bone and lung. Because of the relatively slow growth of the tumor, a significant burden of pulmonary metastases may accumulate, sometimes with remarkably few symptoms. The prognostic implication of lymph node spread is debated. Lymph node involvement by thyroid cancer can be well tolerated but appears to increase the risk of recurrence and mortality, particularly in older patients. The staging of PTC by the TNM system is outlined in Table 341-11. Most papillary cancers are identified in the early stages (>80% stages I or II) and have an excellent prognosis, with survival curves similar to expected survival (Fig. 341-12A). Mortality is markedly increased in stage IV disease (distant metastases), but this group comprises only about 1% of patients. The treatment of PTC is described below.

Follicular

The incidence of FTC varies widely in different parts of the world; it is more common in iodine-deficient regions. FTC is difficult to diagnose by FNA because the distinction between benign and malignant follicular neoplasms rests largely on evidence of invasion into vessels, nerves, or adjacent structures. FTC tends to spread by hematogenous routes leading to bone, lung, and central nervous system metastases. Mortality rates associated with FTC are less favorable than for PTC, in part because a larger proportion of patients present with stage IV disease (Fig. 341-12B). Poor prognostic features include distant metastases, age >50 years, primary tumor size >4 cm, H邦rthle cell histology, and the presence of marked vascular invasion.

Treatment: Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer


Surgery

All well-differentiated thyroid cancers should be surgically excised. In addition to removing the primary lesion, surgery allows accurate histologic diagnosis and staging, and multicentric disease is commonly found in the contralateral thyroid lobe. Lymph node spread can also be assessed at the time of surgery, and involved nodes can be removed. Recommendations about the extent of surgery vary for stage I disease, as survival rates are similar for lobectomy and near-total thyroidectomy. Lobectomy is associated with a lower incidence of hypoparathyroidism and injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerves. However, it is not possible to monitor Tg levels or to perform whole-body 131I scans in the presence of the residual lobe. Moreover, if final staging or subsequent follow-up indicates the need for radioiodine scanning or treatment, repeat surgery is necessary to remove the remaining thyroid tissue. Therefore, near-total thyroidectomy is preferable in almost all patients; complication rates are acceptably low if the surgeon is highly experienced in the procedure. Postsurgical radioablation of the remnant thyroid tissue is increasingly being used because it may destroy remaining or multifocal thyroid carcinoma, and it facilitates the use of Tg determinations and radioiodine scanning for long-term follow-up by eliminating residual normal or neoplastic tissue.

TSH Suppression Therapy

As most tumors are still TSH-responsive, levothyroxine suppression of TSH is a mainstay of thyroid cancer treatment. Though TSH suppression clearly provides therapeutic benefit, there are no prospective studies that identify the optimal level of TSH suppression. A reasonable goal is to suppress TSH as much as possible without subjecting the patient to unnecessary side effects from excess thyroid hormone, such as atrial fibrillation, osteopenia, anxiety, and other manifestations of thyrotoxicosis. For patients at low risk of recurrence, TSH should be suppressed into the low but detectable range (0.1每0.5 mIU/L). For patients at high risk of recurrence or with known metastatic disease, complete TSH suppression is indicated if there are no strong contraindications to mild thyrotoxicosis. In this instance, unbound T4 must also be monitored to avoid excessive treatment.

Radioiodine Treatment

Well-differentiated thyroid cancer still incorporates radioiodine, though less efficiently than normal thyroid follicular cells. Radioiodine uptake is determined primarily by expression of the NIS and is stimulated by TSH, requiring expression of the TSH-R. The retention time for radioactivity is influenced by the extent to which the tumor retains differentiated functions such as iodide trapping and organification. After near-total thyroidectomy, substantial thyroid tissue often remains, particularly in the thyroid bed and surrounding the parathyroid glands. Consequently, 131I ablation is necessary to eliminate remaining normal thyroid tissue and to treat residual tumor cells.

Indications

The use of therapeutic doses of radioiodine remains an area of controversy in thyroid cancer management. However, postoperative thyroid ablation and radioiodine treatment of known residual PTC or FTC clearly reduces recurrence rates but has a smaller impact on mortality, particularly in patients at relatively low risk. This low-risk group includes most patients with stage 1 PTC with primary tumors <1.5 cm in size. For patients with larger papillary tumors, spread to the adjacent lymph nodes, FTC, or evidence of metastases, thyroid ablation and radioiodine treatment are generally indicated.

131I Thyroid Ablation and Treatment

As noted above, the decision to use 131I for thyroid ablation should be coordinated with the surgical approach, as radioablation is much more effective when there is minimal remaining normal thyroid tissue. A typical strategy is to treat the patient for several weeks postoperatively with liothyronine (25 g bid or tid), followed by thyroid hormone withdrawal. Ideally, the TSH level should increase to >50 mU/L over 3每4 weeks. The level to which TSH rises is dictated largely by the amount of normal thyroid tissue remaining postoperatively. Recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) has also been used to enhance 131I uptake for postsurgical ablation. It appears to be at least as effective as thyroid hormone withdrawal and should be particularly useful as residual thyroid tissue prevents an adequate endogenous TSH rise.

A pretreatment scanning dose of 131I [usually 111每185 MBq (3每5 mCi)] can reveal the amount of residual tissue and provides guidance about the dose needed to accomplish ablation. However, because of concerns about radioactive "stunning" that impairs subsequent treatment, there is a trend to avoid pretreatment scanning and to proceed directly to ablation, unless there is suspicion that the amount of residual tissue will alter therapy. A maximum outpatient 131I dose is 1110 MBq (29.9 mCi) in the United States, though ablation is often more complete using greater doses [1850每3700 MBq (50每100 mCi)]. Patients should be placed on a low-iodine diet (<50 g/d urinary iodine) to increase radioiodine uptake. In patients with known residual cancer, the larger doses ensure thyroid ablation and may destroy remaining tumor cells. A whole-body scan following the high-dose radioiodine treatment is useful to identify possible metastatic disease.

Follow-Up Whole-Body Thyroid Scanning and Thyroglobulin Determinations

An initial whole-body scan should be performed about 6 months after thyroid ablation. The strategy for follow-up management of thyroid cancer has been altered by the availability of rhTSH to stimulate 131I uptake and by the improved sensitivity of Tg assays to detect residual or recurrent disease. A scheme for using either rhTSH or thyroid hormone withdrawal for thyroid scanning is summarized in Fig. 341-13. After thyroid ablation, rhTSH can be used in follow-up to stimulate Tg and 131I uptake without subjecting patients to thyroid hormone withdrawal and its associated symptoms of hypothyroidism as well as the risk of tumor growth after prolonged TSH stimulation. Alternatively, in patients who are likely to require 131I treatment, the traditional approach of thyroid hormone withdrawal can be used to increase TSH. This involves switching patients from levothyroxine (T4) to the more rapidly cleared hormone liothyronine (T3), thereby allowing TSH to increase more quickly. Because TSH stimulates Tg levels, Tg measurements should be obtained after administration of rhTSH or when TSH levels have risen after thyroid hormone withdrawal.

In low-risk patients who have no clinical evidence of residual disease after ablation and a basal Tg <1 ng/ml, increasing evidence supports the use of rhTSH-stimulated Tg levels one year after ablation, without the need for radioiodine scanning. If stimulated Tg levels are low (<2 ng/ml) and, ideally, undetectable, these patients can be managed with suppressive therapy and measurements of unstimulated Tg every 6每12 months. The absence of Tg antibodies should be confirmed in these patients. On the other hand, patients with residual disease on whole-body scanning or those with elevated Tg levels require additional 131I therapy. In addition, most authorities advocate radioiodine treatment for scan-negative, Tg-positive (Tg >5每10 ng/mL) patients, as many derive therapeutic benefit from a large dose of 131I.

In addition to radioiodine, external beam radiotherapy is also used to treat specific metastatic lesions, particularly when they cause bone pain or threaten neurologic injury (e.g., vertebral metastases).

New Potential Therapies

Kinase inhibitors are being explored as a means to target pathways known to be active in thyroid cancer, including the Ras, BRAF, EGFR, VEGFR, and angiogenesis pathways. Partial responses have been seen in small trials using motesaniv, sorafenib, and other agents, but the efficacy of these agents awaits larger studies.

Anaplastic and Other Forms of Thyroid Cancer

Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer

As noted above, ATC is a poorly differentiated and aggressive cancer. The prognosis is poor, and most patients die within 6 months of diagnosis. Because of the undifferentiated state of these tumors, the uptake of radioiodine is usually negligible, but it can be used therapeutically if there is residual uptake. Chemotherapy has been attempted with multiple agents, including anthracyclines and paclitaxel, but it is usually ineffective. External beam radiation therapy can be attempted and continued if tumors are responsive.

Thyroid Lymphoma

Lymphoma in the thyroid gland often arises in the background of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. A rapidly expanding thyroid mass suggests the possibility of this diagnosis. Diffuse large-cell lymphoma is the most common type in the thyroid. Biopsies reveal sheets of lymphoid cells that can be difficult to distinguish from small-cell lung cancer or ATC. These tumors are often highly sensitive to external radiation. Surgical resection should be avoided as initial therapy because it may spread disease that is otherwise localized to the thyroid. If staging indicates disease outside of the thyroid, treatment should follow guidelines used for other forms of lymphoma (Chap. 110).

Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma

MTC can be sporadic or familial and accounts for about 5% of thyroid cancers. There are three familial forms of MTC: MEN 2A, MEN 2B, and familial MTC without other features of MEN (Chap. 351). In general, MTC is more aggressive in MEN 2B than in MEN 2A, and familial MTC is more aggressive than sporadic MTC. Elevated serum calcitonin provides a marker of residual or recurrent disease. It is reasonable to test all patients with MTC for RET mutations, as genetic counseling and testing of family members can be offered to those individuals who test positive for mutations.

The management of MTC is primarily surgical. Unlike tumors derived from thyroid follicular cells, these tumors do not take up radioiodine. External radiation treatment and chemotherapy may provide palliation in patients with advanced disease (Chap. 351).
 
Approach to the Patient

A Thyroid Nodule

Palpable thyroid nodules are found in about 5% of adults, but the prevalence varies considerably worldwide. Given this high prevalence rate, practitioners commonly identify thyroid nodules. The main goal of this evaluation is to identify, in a cost-effective manner, the small subgroup of individuals with malignant lesions.

Nodules are more common in iodine-deficient areas, in women, and with aging. Most palpable nodules are >1 cm in diameter, but the ability to feel a nodule is influenced by its location within the gland (superficial versus deeply embedded), the anatomy of the patient's neck, and the experience of the examiner. More sensitive methods of detection, such as CT, thyroid ultrasound, and pathologic studies, reveal thyroid nodules in >20% of glands. The presence of these thyroid incidentalomas has led to much debate about how to detect nodules and which nodules to investigate further. Most authorities still rely on physical examination to detect thyroid nodules, reserving ultrasound for monitoring nodule size or as an aid in thyroid biopsy.

An approach to the evaluation of a solitary nodule is outlined in Fig. 341-14. Most patients with thyroid nodules have normal thyroid function tests. Nonetheless, thyroid function should be assessed by measuring a TSH level, which may be suppressed by one or more autonomously functioning nodules. If the TSH is suppressed, a radionuclide scan is indicated to determine if the identified nodule is "hot," as lesions with increased uptake are almost never malignant and FNA is unnecessary. Otherwise, FNA biopsy, ideally performed with ultrasound guidance, should be the first step in the evaluation of a thyroid nodule. FNA has good sensitivity and specificity when performed by physicians familiar with the procedure and when the results are interpreted by experienced cytopathologists. The technique is particularly useful for detecting PTC. The distinction of benign and malignant follicular lesions is often not possible using cytology alone.

Figure 341-14 Approach to the Patient with a Thyroid Nodule.

 
 
 
See text and references for details. *About one-third of nodules are cystic or mixed solid-cystic. US, ultrasound; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; FNA, fine-needle aspiration.
 
 

In several large studies, FNA biopsies yielded the following findings: 70% benign, 10% malignant or suspicious for malignancy, and 20% nondiagnostic or yielding insufficient material for diagnosis. Characteristic features of malignancy mandate surgery. A diagnosis of follicular neoplasm also warrants surgery, as benign and malignant lesions cannot be distinguished based on cytopathology or frozen section. The management of patients with benign lesions is more variable. Many authorities advocate TSH suppression, whereas others monitor nodule size without suppression. With either approach, thyroid nodule size should be monitored, ideally using ultrasound. Repeat FNA is indicated if a nodule enlarges, and a second biopsy should be performed within 2每5 years to confirm the benign status of the nodule.

Nondiagnostic biopsies occur for many reasons, including a fibrotic reaction with relatively few cells available for aspiration, a cystic lesion in which cellular components reside along the cyst margin, or a nodule that may be too small for accurate aspiration. For these reasons, ultrasound-guided FNA is indicated when the FNA is repeated. Ultrasound characteristics are also useful for deciding which nodules to biopsy when multiple nodules are present. Sonographic characteristics suggestive of malignancy include microcalcifications, increased vascularity, and hypoechogenicity within the nodule.

The evaluation of a thyroid nodule is stressful for most patients. They are concerned about the possibility of thyroid cancer, whether verbalized or not. It is constructive, therefore, to review the diagnostic approach and to reassure patients when no malignancy is found. When a suspicious lesion or thyroid cancer is identified, the generally favorable prognosis and available treatment options can be reassuring.

Chapter 342. Disorders of the Adrenal Cortex >
 

Disorders of the Adrenal Cortex: Introduction

The adrenal cortex produces three classes of corticosteroid hormones: glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol), mineralocorticoids (e.g., aldosterone), and adrenal androgen precursors (e.g., dehydroepiandrosterone, DHEA) (Fig. 342-1). Glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids act through specific nuclear receptors, regulating aspects of the physiologic stress response as well as blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis. Adrenal androgen precursors are converted in the gonads and peripheral target cells to sex steroids that act via nuclear androgen and estrogen receptors.

Disorders of the adrenal cortex are characterized by deficiency or excess of one or several of the three major corticosteroid classes. Hormone deficiency can be caused by inherited glandular or enzymatic disorders or by destruction of the pituitary or adrenal gland by autoimmune disorders, infection, infarction, or by iatrogenic events such as surgery or hormonal suppression. Hormone excess is usually the result of neoplasia, leading to increased production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary or neuroendocrine cells (ectopic ACTH), or increased production of glucocorticoids or mineralocorticoids by adrenal nodules. Adrenal nodules are increasingly identified incidentally during abdominal imaging performed for other reasons.

Adrenal Anatomy and Development

The normal adrenal glands weigh 6每11 g each. They are located above the kidneys and have their own blood supply. Arterial blood flows initially to the subcapsular region and then meanders from the outer cortical zona glomerulosa through the intermediate zona fasciculata to the inner zona reticularis and eventually to the adrenal medulla. The right suprarenal vein drains directly into the vena cava while the left suprarenal vein drains into the left renal vein.

During early embryonic development, the adrenals originate from the urogenital ridge and then separate from gonads and kidneys about the 6th week of gestation. Concordant with the time of sexual differentiation (seventh to ninth week of gestation, see Chap. 349), the adrenal cortex starts to produce cortisol and the adrenal sex steroid precursor DHEA. The orphan nuclear receptors SF1 (steroidogenic factor 1) and DAX1 (dosage-sensitive sex reversal gene 1), among others, play a crucial role during this period of development, as they regulate a multitude of adrenal genes involved in steroidogenesis.

Regulatory Control of Steroidogenesis

Production of glucocorticoids and adrenal androgens is under the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, whereas mineralocorticoids are regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system.

Glucocorticoid synthesis is under inhibitory feedback control by the hypothalamus and the pituitary (Fig. 342-2). Hypothalamic release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) occurs in response to endogenous or exogenous stress. CRH stimulates the cleavage of the 241每amino acid polypeptide pro opiomelanocortin (POMC) by pituitary-specific prohormone convertase, yielding adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH is released by the corticotrope cells of the anterior pituitary and acts as the pivotal regulator of cortisol synthesis, with additional short-term effects on mineralocorticoid and adrenal androgen synthesis. The release of CRH, and subsequently ACTH, occurs in a pulsatile fashion that follows a circadian rhythm under the control of the hypothalamus, specifically its suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), with additional regulation by a complex network of cell-specific clock genes. Reflecting the pattern of ACTH secretion, adrenal cortisol secretion exhibits a distinct circadian rhythm, with peak levels in the morning and low levels in the evening (Fig. 342-3).

Diagnostic tests assessing the HPA axis make use of the fact that it is regulated by negative feedback. Glucocorticoid excess is diagnosed by employing a dexamethasone suppression test. Dexamethasone, a potent glucocorticoid, suppresses CRH/ACTH and, therefore, endogenous cortisol. Various versions of the dexamethasone suppression test are described in detail in Chap. 339. If cortisol production is autonomous (e.g., adrenal nodule), ACTH is already suppressed and dexamethasone has little additional effect. If cortisol production is driven by an ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma, dexamethasone suppression is ineffective at low doses but usually induces suppression at high doses. If cortisol production is driven by an ectopic source of ACTH, the tumors are usually resistant to dexamethasone suppression. Thus, the dexamethasone suppression test is useful to establish the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome and to assist with the differential diagnosis of cortisol excess.

Conversely, to assess glucocorticoid deficiency, ACTH stimulation of cortisol production is used. The ACTH peptide contains 39 amino acids but the first 24 are sufficient to elicit a physiologic response. The standard ACTH stimulation test involves administration of cosyntropin (ACTH 1-24), 0.25 mg IM or IV, and collection of blood samples at 0, 30, and 60 minutes for cortisol. A normal response is defined as a cortisol level >20 g/dL or an increment of >10 g/dL over baseline. A low-dose (1 g cosyntropin IV) version of this test has been advocated to avoid overstimulation of the adrenal gland. Alternatively, an insulin tolerance test (ITT) can be used to assess adrenal insufficiency. It involves injection of insulin to induce hypoglycemia, which represents a strong stress signal that triggers hypothalamic CRH release and activation of the entire HPA axis. The ITT involves administration of regular insulin 0.1 U/kg IV (dose should be lower if hypopituitarism is likely) and collection of blood samples at 0, 30, 60, and 120 minutes for glucose, cortisol, and growth hormone (GH), if also assessing the GH axis. Oral or IV glucose is administered after the patient has achieved symptomatic hypoglycemia (usually glucose <40 mg/dL). A normal response is defined as a cortisol >20 g/dL and GH >5.1 g/L. The ITT requires careful clinical monitoring and sequential measurements of glucose. It is contraindicated in patients with coronary disease, cerebrovascular disease, or seizure disorders, which has made the short cosyntropin test the commonly accepted first-line test.

Mineralocorticoid production is controlled by the RAA regulatory cycle, which is initiated by the release of renin from the juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney, resulting in cleavage of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I in the liver (Fig. 342-4). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) cleaves angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which binds and activates the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1 receptor), resulting in increased aldosterone production and vasoconstriction. Aldosterone enhances sodium retention and potassium excretion, and increases the arterial perfusion pressure, which in turn regulates renin release. Because mineralocorticoid synthesis is primarily under the control of the RAA system, hypothalamic-pituitary damage does not significantly impact the capacity of the adrenal to synthesize aldosterone.

Similar to the HPA axis, the assessment of the RAA system can be used for diagnostic purposes. If mineralocorticoid excess is present, there is a counter-regulatory downregulation of plasma renin (see below for testing). Conversely, in mineralocorticoid deficiency, plasma renin is markedly increased. Physiologically, oral or IV sodium loading results in suppression of aldosterone, a response that is attenuated or absent in patients with autonomous mineralocorticoid excess.

Steroid Hormone Synthesis, Metabolism, and Action

ACTH stimulation is required for the initiation of steroidogenesis. The ACTH receptor MC2R (melanocortin 2 receptor) interacts with the MC2R-accessory protein MRAP, and the complex is transported to the adrenocortical cell membrane, where it binds to ACTH (Fig. 342-5). ACTH stimulation generates cyclic AMP (cAMP), which upregulates the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway. PKA activation impacts steroidogenesis in three distinct ways: (1) increases the import of cholesterol esters; (2) increases the activity of hormone- sensitive lipase, which cleaves cholesterol esters to cholesterol for import into the mitochondrion; and (3) increases the availability and phosphorylation of CREB (cAMP response element binding), a transcription factor that enhances transcription of CYP11A1 and other enzymes required for glucocorticoid synthesis.

Adrenal steroidogenesis occurs in a zone-specific fashion, with mineralocorticoid synthesis occurring in the outer zona glomerulosa, glucocorticoid synthesis in the zona fasciculata, and adrenal androgen synthesis in the inner zona reticularis (Fig. 342-1). All steroidogenic pathways require cholesterol import into the mitochondrion, a process initiated by the action of the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein, which shuttles cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane. The majority of steroidogenic enzymes are cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, which are either located in the mitochondrion (side chain cleavage enzyme, CYP11A1; 11-hydroxylase, CYP11B1; aldosterone synthase, CYP11B2) or in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (17-hydroxylase, CYP17A1; 21-hydroxylase, CYP21A2; aromatase, CYP19A1). These enzymes require electron donation via specific redox cofactor enzymes, P450 oxidoreductase (POR), and adrenodoxin/adrenodoxin reductase (ADX/ADR) for the microsomal and mitochondrial CYP enzymes, respectively. In addition, the short-chain dehydrogenase 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (3-HSD2), also termed 4,5 isomerase, plays a major role in adrenal steroidogenesis.

The cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme CYP11A1 generates pregnenolone. Glucocorticoid synthesis requires conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone by 3-HSD2, followed by conversion to 17-hydroxyprogesterone by CYP17A1, further hydroxylation at carbon 21 by 21-hydroxylase, and eventually, 11-hydroxylation by CYP11B1 to generate active cortisol (Fig. 342-1). Mineralocorticoid synthesis also requires progesterone, which is first converted to deoxycorticosterone by CYP21A2 and then converted via corticosterone and 18-hydroxycorticosterone to aldosterone in three steps catalyzed by CYP11B2. For adrenal androgen synthesis, pregnenolone undergoes conversion by CYP17A1, which uniquely catalyzes two enzymatic reactions. Via its 17-hydroxylase activity, CYP17A1 converts pregnenolone to 17-hydroxypregnenolone, followed by generation of the universal sex steroid precursor DHEA via CYP17A1 17,20 lyase activity. The majority of DHEA is secreted by the adrenal in the form of its sulfate ester, DHEAS, generated by DHEA sulfotransferase (SULT2A1).

Following its release from the adrenal, cortisol circulates in the bloodstream mainly bound to cortisol-binding globulin (CBG) and to a lesser extent to albumin, with only a minor fraction circulating as free, unbound hormone. Free cortisol is thought to enter cells directly, not requiring active transport. In addition, in a multitude of peripheral target tissues of glucocorticoid action, including adipose, liver, muscle, and brain, cortisol is generated from inactive cortisone within the cell by the enzyme 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11-HSD1) (Fig. 342-6). Thereby, 11-HSD1 functions as a tissue-specific prereceptor regulator of glucocorticoid action. For the conversion of inactive cortisone to active cortisol, 11-HSD1 requires nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NADPH (reduced form)], which is provided by the enzyme hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH). Like the catalytic domain of 11-HSD1, H6PDH is located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, and converts glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to 6-phosphogluconate (6PGL), thereby regenerating NADP+ to NADPH, which drives the activation of cortisol from cortisone by 11-HSD1.

In the cytosol of target cells, cortisol binds and activates the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which results in dissociation of heat shock proteins (HSP) from the receptor and subsequent dimerization (Fig. 342-6). Cortisol-bound GR dimers translocate to the nucleus and activate glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the DNA sequence, thereby enhancing transcription of glucocorticoid-regulated genes (GR transactivation). However, cortisol-bound GR can also form heterodimers with transcription factors such as AP-1 or NF-B, resulting in transrepression of proinflammatory genes, a mechanism of major importance for the anti-inflammatory action of glucocorticoids. It is important to note that corticosterone also exerts glucocorticoid activity, albeit much weaker than cortisol itself. However, in rodents corticosterone is the major glucocorticoid and in patients with 17-hydroxylase deficiency, lack of cortisol can be compensated for by higher concentrations of corticosterone that accumulates as a consequence of the enzymatic block.

Cortisol is inactivated to cortisone by the microsomal enzyme 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11-HSD2) (Fig. 342-7), mainly in the kidney, but also in the colon, salivary glands, and other target tissues. Cortisol and aldosterone bind the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) with equal affinity; however, cortisol circulates in the bloodstream at about a thousandfold higher concentration. Thus, only rapid inactivation of cortisol to cortisone by 11-HSD2 prevents MR activation by excess cortisol, thereby acting as a tissue-specific modulator of the MR pathway. In addition to cortisol and aldosterone, deoxycorticosterone (DOC) (Fig. 342-1) also exerts mineralocorticoid activity. DOC accumulation due to 11-hydroxylase deficiency or due to tumor-related excess production can result in mineralocorticoid excess.

Analogous to cortisol action via the GR, aldosterone (or cortisol) binding to the MR dissociates the HSP每receptor complex, allowing homodimerization of the MR, and translocation of the hormone-bound MR dimer to the nucleus (Fig. 342-7). The activated MR enhances transcription of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and serum glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK-1). In the cytosol, interaction of ENaC with Nedd4 prevents cell surface expression of ENaC. However, SGK-1 phosphorylates serine residues within the Nedd4 protein, reduces the interaction between Nedd4 and ENaC and consequently enhances the trafficking of ENaC to the cell surface, where it mediates sodium retention.

Cushing's Syndrome

(See also Chap. 339) Cushing's syndrome reflects a constellation of clinical features that result from chronic exposure to excess glucocorticoids of any etiology. The disorder can be ACTH-dependent (e.g., pituitary corticotrope adenoma, ectopic secretion of ACTH by nonpituitary tumor) or ACTH-independent (e.g., adrenocortical adenoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, nodular adrenal hyperplasia), as well as iatrogenic (e.g., administration of exogenous glucocorticoids to treat various inflammatory conditions). The term Cushing's disease refers specifically to Cushing's syndrome caused by a pituitary corticotrope adenoma.

Epidemiology

Cushing's syndrome is generally considered a rare disease. It occurs with an incidence of 1每2 per 100,000 population per year. However, it is debated whether mild cortisol excess may be more prevalent among patients with several features of Cushing's such as centripetal obesity, type 2 diabetes, and osteoporotic vertebral fractures, recognizing that these are relatively nonspecific and common in the population.

In the overwhelming majority of patients, Cushing's syndrome is caused by an ACTH-producing corticotrope adenoma of the pituitary (Table 342-1), as initially described by Harvey Cushing in 1912. Cushing's disease more frequently affects women, with the exception of prepubertal cases, where it is more common in boys. By contrast, ectopic ACTH syndrome is more frequently identified in men. Only 10% of patients with Cushing's syndrome have a primary, adrenal cause of their disease (e.g., autonomous cortisol excess independent of ACTH), and most of these patients are women. Overall, the medical use of glucocorticoids for immunosuppression, or for the treatment of inflammatory disorders, is the most common cause of Cushing's syndrome.

Abbreviations: ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; AIMAH, ACTH-independent macronodular hyperplasia; PPNAD, primary pigmented nodular adrenal disease.
 

Etiology

In at least 90% of patients with Cushing's disease, ACTH excess is caused by a corticotrope pituitary microadenoma, often only a few millimeters in diameter. Pituitary macroadenomas (i.e. tumors >1 cm in size), are found in only 5每10% of patients. Pituitary corticotrope adenomas usually occur sporadically, but very rarely can be found in the context of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) (Chap. 351).

Ectopic ACTH production is predominantly caused by occult carcinoid tumors, most frequently in the lung, but also in thymus or pancreas. Because of their small size, these tumors are often difficult to locate. Advanced small cell lung cancer can cause ectopic ACTH production. In rare cases, ectopic ACTH production has been found to originate from medullary thyroid carcinoma or pheochromocytoma, the latter co-secreting catecholamines and ACTH.

The majority of patients with ACTH-independent cortisol excess harbor a cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma. Adrenocortical carcinomas may also cause ACTH-independent disease and are often large, with excess production of several corticosteroid classes. A rare but notable cause of adrenal cortisol excess is ACTH-independent macronodular hyperplasia (AIMAH), generally characterized by ectopic expression of receptors not usually found in the adrenal, including receptors for luteinizing hormone, vasopressin, serotonin, interleukin-1, or gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), the cause of food-dependent Cushing's. Activation of these receptors results in upregulation of PKA signaling, as physiologically occurs with ACTH, with a subsequent increase in cortisol production. Mutations in a regulatory subunit of PKA (PRKAR1A) are found in patients with primary pigmented nodular adrenal disease (PPNAD) as part of Carney's complex, an autosomal dominant multiple neoplasia condition associated with cardiac myxomas, hyperlentiginosis, Sertoli's cell tumors, and PPNAD. PPNAD can present as micronodular or macronodular hyperplasia, or both. Another rare cause of ACTH-independent Cushing's is McCune-Albright syndrome, also associated with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, unilateral caf谷-au-lait spots, and precocious puberty. McCune-Albright syndrome is caused by activating mutations in GNAS-1 (guanine nucleotide binding protein alpha stimulating activity polypeptide 1), and such mutations have also been found in bilateral macronodular hyperplasia without other McCune-Albright features (Table 342-1; see also Chap. 355).

Clinical Manifestations

Glucocorticoids affect almost all cells of the body and thus signs of cortisol excess impact multiple physiologic systems (Table 342-2), with upregulation of gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, and protein catabolism causing the most prominent features. In addition, excess glucocorticoid secretion overcomes the ability of 11-HSD2 to rapidly inactivate cortisol to cortisone in the kidney, thereby exerting mineralocorticoid actions, manifest as diastolic hypertension, hypokalemia, and edema. Excess glucocorticoids also interfere with central regulatory systems, leading to suppression of gonadotropins with subsequent hypogonadism and amenorrhea, and suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, resulting in decreased TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) secretion.

The majority of clinical signs and symptoms observed in Cushing's syndrome are relatively nonspecific and include features such as obesity, diabetes, diastolic hypertension, hirsutism, and depression that are commonly found in patients who do not have Cushing's. Therefore, careful clinical assessment is an important aspect of evaluating suspected cases. A diagnosis of Cushing's should be considered when several clinical features are found in the same patient, in particular when more specific features are found. These include fragility of the skin, with easy bruising and broad (>1 cm), purplish striae (Fig. 342-8), and signs of proximal myopathy, which becomes most obvious when trying to stand up from a chair without the use of hands or when climbing stairs. Clinical manifestations of Cushing's do not differ substantially among the different causes of Cushing's. In ectopic ACTH syndrome, hyperpigmentation of the knuckles, scars, or skin areas exposed to increased friction can be observed (Fig. 342-8), and is caused by stimulatory effects of excess ACTH and other POMC cleavage products on melanocyte pigment production. Furthermore, patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome, and some with adrenocortical carcinoma as the cause of Cushing's, may have a more brisk onset and rapid progression of clinical signs and symptoms.

Patients with Cushing's syndrome can be acutely endangered by deep vein thrombosis, with subsequent pulmonary embolism due to a hypercoagulable state associated with Cushing's. The majority of patients also experience psychiatric symptoms, mostly in the form of anxiety or depression, but acute paranoid or depressive psychosis may also occur. Even after cure, long-term health may be affected by an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis with vertebral fractures, depending on the duration and degree of exposure to significant cortisol excess.

Diagnosis

The most important first step in the management of patients with suspected Cushing's syndrome is to establish the correct diagnosis. Most mistakes in clinical management, leading to unnecessary imaging or surgery, are made because the diagnostic protocol is not followed (Fig. 342-9). This protocol requires establishing the diagnosis of Cushing's beyond doubt prior to employing any tests used for the differential diagnosis of the condition. In principle, after excluding exogenous glucocorticoid use as the cause of clinical signs and symptoms, suspected cases should be tested if there are multiple and progressive features of Cushing's, particularly features with a potentially higher discriminatory value. Exclusion of Cushing's is also indicated in patients with incidentally discovered adrenal masses.

A diagnosis of Cushing's can be considered as established if the results of several tests are consistently suggestive of Cushing's. These tests may include increased 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion in three separate collections, failure to appropriately suppress morning cortisol after overnight exposure to dexamethasone, and evidence of loss of diurnal cortisol secretion with high levels at midnight, the time of the physiologically lowest secretion (Fig. 342-9). Factors potentially affecting the outcome of these diagnostic tests have to be excluded such as incomplete 24-hour urine collection or rapid inactivation of dexamethasone due to concurrent intake of CYP3A4-inducing drugs (e.g., antiepileptics, rifampicin). Concurrent intake of oral contraceptives that raise CBG and thus total cortisol can cause failure to suppress after dexamethasone. If in doubt, testing should be repeated after 4每6 weeks off estrogens. Patients with pseudo-Cushing states, i.e., alcohol-related, and those with cyclic Cushing's may require further testing to safely confirm or exclude the diagnosis of Cushing's. In addition, the biochemical assays employed can affect the test results, with specificity representing a common problem with antibody-based assays for the measurement of urinary free cortisol. These assays have been greatly improved by the introduction of highly specific tandem mass spectrometry.

Differential Diagnosis

The evaluation of patients with confirmed Cushing's should be carried out by an endocrinologist and begins with the differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent and ACTH-independent cortisol excess (Fig. 342-9). Generally, plasma ACTH levels are suppressed in cases of autonomous adrenal cortisol excess, as a consequence of enhanced negative feedback to the hypothalamus and pituitary. By contrast, patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing's have normal or increased plasma ACTH, with very high levels being found in some patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome. Importantly, imaging should only be used after it is established whether the cortisol excess is ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent, as nodules in the pituitary or the adrenal are a common finding in the general population. In patients with confirmed ACTH-independent excess, adrenal imaging is indicated (Fig. 342-10), preferably using an unenhanced CT scan. This allows assessment of adrenal morphology and determination of tumor density in Hounsfield Units (HU), which helps to distinguish between benign and malignant adrenal lesions.

MRI showing bilateral macronodular hyperplasia causing Cushing's syndrome.
 
 

For ACTH-dependent cortisol excess (Chap. 339), an MRI of the pituitary is the investigation of choice, but it may not show an abnormality in up to 40% of cases because small tumors are below the sensitivity of detection. Characteristically, pituitary corticotrope adenomas fail to enhance following gadolinium administration on T1-weighted MRI images. In all cases of confirmed ACTH-dependent Cushing's, further tests are required for the differential diagnosis of pituitary Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome. These tests exploit the fact that most pituitary corticotrope adenomas still display regulatory features, including residual ACTH suppression by high-dose glucocorticoids and CRH responsiveness. In contrast, ectopic sources of ACTH are typically resistant to dexamethasone suppression and unresponsive to CRH (Fig. 342-9). However, it should be noted that a small minority of ectopic ACTH-producing tumors exhibit dynamic responses similar to pituitary corticotrope tumors. If the two tests show discordant results, or if there is any other reason for doubt, the differential diagnosis can be further clarified by performing bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) with concurrent blood sampling for ACTH in the right and left inferior petrosal sinus and a peripheral vein. An increased central/peripheral plasma ACTH ratio >2 at baseline and >3 after CRH injection is indicative of Cushing's disease (Fig. 342-9), with very high sensitivity and specificity. Of note, the results of the IPSS cannot be reliably used for lateralization (i.e. prediction of the location of the tumor within the pituitary), because there is broad interindividual variability in the venous drainage of the pituitary region. Importantly, no cortisol-lowering agents should be used prior to IPSS.

If the differential diagnostic testing indicates ectopic ACTH syndrome, then further imaging should include high-resolution, fine-cut CT scanning of the chest and abdomen for scrutiny of the lung, thymus, and pancreas. If no lesions are identified, an MRI of the chest can be considered as carcinoid tumors usually show high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Furthermore, octreotide scintigraphy can be helpful in some cases as ectopic ACTH-producing tumors often express somatostatin receptors. Depending on the suspected cause, patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome should also undergo blood sampling for fasting gut hormones, chromogranin A, calcitonin, and biochemical exclusion of pheochromocytoma.

Treatment: Cushing's Syndrome

Overt Cushing's is associated with a poor prognosis if left untreated. In ACTH-independent disease, treatment consists of surgical removal of the adrenal tumor. For smaller tumors, a minimally invasive approach can be employed, whereas for larger tumors and those suspected of malignancy, an open approach is preferred.

In Cushing's disease, the treatment of choice is selective removal of the pituitary corticotrope tumor, usually via a transsphenoidal approach. This results in an initial cure rate of 70每80% when performed by a highly experienced surgeon. However, even after initial remission following surgery, long-term follow-up is important as late relapse occurs in a significant number of patients. If pituitary disease recurs, there are several options, including second surgery, radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, and bilateral adrenalectomy. These options need to be applied in a highly individualized fashion.

In some with very severe, overt Cushing's (e.g., difficult to control hypokalemic hypertension or acute psychosis), it may be necessary to introduce medical therapy to rapidly control the cortisol excess during the period leading up to surgery. Similarly, patients with metastasized, glucocorticoid-producing carcinomas may require long-term antiglucocorticoid drug treatment. In case of ectopic ACTH syndrome, in which the tumor cannot be located, one must carefully weigh whether drug treatment or bilateral adrenalectomy is the most appropriate choice, with the latter facilitating immediate cure but requiring life-long corticosteroid replacement. In this instance, it is paramount to ensure regular imaging follow-up for identification of the ectopic ACTH source.

Oral agents with established efficacy in Cushing's syndrome are metyrapone and ketoconazole. Metyrapone inhibits cortisol synthesis at the level of 11-hydroxylase (Fig. 342-1), whereas the antimycotic drug ketoconazole inhibits the early steps of steroidogenesis. Typical starting doses are 500 mg/tid for metyrapone (maximum dose, 6 g) and 200 mg/tid for ketoconazole (maximum dose, 1200 mg). Mitotane, a derivative of the insecticide o,p'DDD, is an adrenolytic agent that is also effective for reducing cortisol. Because of its side effect profile, it is most commonly used in the context of adrenocortical carcinoma, but low-dose treatment (500每1000 mg per day) has also been used in benign Cushing's. In severe cases of cortisol excess, etomidate can be used to lower cortisol. It is administered by continuous IV infusion in low, nonanesthetic doses.

After the successful removal of an ACTH- or cortisol-producing tumor, the HPA axis will remain suppressed. Thus, hydrocortisone replacement needs to be initiated at the time of surgery and slowly tapered following recovery, to allow physiologic adaptation to normal cortisol levels. Depending on degree and duration of cortisol excess, the HPA axis may require many months or even years to resume normal function.

Mineralocorticoid Excess

Epidemiology

Following the first description of a patient with an aldosterone-producing adrenal adenoma (Conn's syndrome), mineralocorticoid excess was thought to represent a rare cause of hypertension. However, in studies systematically screening all patients with hypertension, a much higher prevalence is now recognized, ranging from 5 to 12%. The prevalence is higher when patients are preselected for hypokalemic hypertension.

Etiology

The most common cause of mineralocorticoid excess is primary hyperaldosteronism, reflecting excess production of aldosterone by the adrenal zona glomerulosa. Bilateral micronodular hyperplasia is somewhat more common than unilateral adrenal adenomas (Table 342-3). Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia is usually micronodular but can also contain larger nodules that might be mistaken for a unilateral adenoma. In rare instances, primary hyperaldosteronism is caused by an adrenocortical carcinoma. Carcinomas should be considered in younger patients and in those with larger tumors, as benign aldosterone-producing adenomas usually measure <1 cm in diameter.

Abbreviations: DOC, deoxycorticosterone; ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; MR, mineralocorticoid receptor.
 

A rare cause of aldosterone excess is glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA), which is caused by a chimeric gene resulting from cross-over of promoter sequences between the CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 genes that are involved in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid synthesis, respectively (Fig. 342-1). This rearrangement brings CYP11B2 under the control of ACTH receptor signaling; consequently, aldosterone production is regulated by ACTH rather than by renin. The family history can be helpful as there may be evidence for dominant transmission of hypertension. Recognition of the disorder is important because it can be associated with early-onset hypertension and strokes. In addition, glucocorticoid suppression can reduce aldosterone production.

Other rare causes of mineralocorticoid excess are listed in Table 342-3. An important cause is excess binding and activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor by a steroid other than aldosterone. Cortisol acts as a potent mineralocorticoid if it escapes efficient inactivation to cortisone by 11-HSD2 in the kidney (Fig. 342-7). This can be caused by inactivating mutations in the HSD11B2 gene resulting in the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME) that characteristically manifests with severe hypokalemic hypertension in childhood. However, milder mutations may cause normokalemic hypertension manifesting in adulthood (Type II AME). Inhibition of 11-HSD2 by excess licorice ingestion also results in hypokalemic hypertension, as does overwhelming of 11-HSD2 conversion capacity by cortisol excess in Cushing's syndrome. Desoxycorticosterone (DOC) also binds and activates the mineralocorticoid receptor and can cause hypertension if its circulating concentrations are increased. This can arise through autonomous DOC secretion by an adrenocortical carcinoma, but also when DOC accumulates as a consequence of an adrenal enzymatic block, as seen in congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to CYP11B1 (11-hydroxylase) or CYP17A1 (17-hdyroxylase) deficiency (Fig. 342-1). Progesterone can cause hypokalemic hypertension in rare individuals who harbor a mineralocorticoid receptor mutation that enhances binding and activation by progesterone; physiologically, progesterone normally exerts antimineralocorticoid activity. Finally, excess mineralocorticoid activity can be caused by mutations in the  or  subunits of the ENaC, disrupting its interaction with Nedd4 (Fig. 342-7), and thereby decreasing receptor internalization and degradation. The constitutively active ENAC drives hypokalemic hypertension, resulting in an autosomal dominant disorder termed Liddle's syndrome.

Clinical Manifestations

Excess activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor leads to potassium depletion and increased sodium retention, with the latter causing an expansion of extracellular and plasma volume. Increased ENaC activity also results in hydrogen depletion that can cause metabolic alkalosis. Aldosterone also has direct effects on the vascular system, where it increases cardiac remodeling and decreases compliance. Aldosterone excess may cause direct damage to the myocardium and the kidney glomeruli, in addition to secondary damage due to systemic hypertension.

The clinical hallmark of mineralocorticoid excess is hypokalemic hypertension; serum sodium tends to be normal due to the concurrent fluid retention, which in some cases can lead to peripheral edema. Hypokalemia can be exacerbated by thiazide drug treatment, which leads to increased delivery of sodium to the distal renal tubule, thereby driving potassium excretion. Severe hypokalemia can be associated with muscle weakness, overt proximal myopathy, or even hypokalemic paralysis. Severe alkalosis contributes to muscle cramps and, in severe cases, can cause tetany.

Diagnosis

Diagnostic screening for mineralocorticoid excess is not currently recommended for all patients with hypertension, but should be restricted to those who exhibit hypertension associated with drug resistance, hypokalemia, an adrenal mass, or hypertension before the age of 40 years (Fig. 342-11). The accepted screening test is concurrent measurement of plasma renin and aldosterone with subsequent calculation of the aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR) (Fig. 342-11); serum potassium needs to be normalized prior to testing. Stopping antihypertensive medication can be cumbersome, particularly in patients with severe hypertension. Thus, for practical purposes, in the first instance the patient can remain on the usual antihypertensive medications, with the exception that mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists need to be ceased at least 4 weeks prior to ARR measurement. The remaining antihypertensive drugs usually do not affect the outcome of ARR testing, except that -blocker treatment can cause false-positive results and ACE/AT1R inhibitors can cause false-negative results in milder cases (Table 342-4).

ARR screening is positive if the ratio is lower than 750 pmol/L: ng/mL per hour, with a concurrently high normal or increased aldosterone (Fig. 342-11). If one relies on the ARR only, the likelihood of a false-positive ARR becomes greater when renin levels are very low. The characteristics of the biochemical assays are also important. Some labs measure plasma renin activity whereas others measure plasma renin concentrations. Antibody-based assays for the measurement of serum aldosterone lack the reliability of tandem mass spectrometry assays but these are not yet ubiquitously available.

Diagnostic confirmation of mineralocorticoid excess in a patient with positive ARR screening result should be undertaken by an endocrinologist as the tests lack optimized validation. The most straightforward is the saline infusion test, which involves the IV administration of 2 L of physiologic saline over a 4-hour period. Failure of aldosterone to suppress below 140 pmol/L (5 ng/dL) is indicative of autonomous mineralocorticoid excess. Alternative tests are the oral sodium loading test (300 mmol NaCl/d for 3 days) or the fludrocortisone suppression test (0.1 mg q6h with 30 mmol NaCl q8h for 4 days); the latter can be difficult because of the risk of profound hypokalemia and increased hypertension. In patients with overt hypokalemic hypertension, strongly positive ARR, and concurrently increased aldosterone levels, confirmatory testing is usually not necessary.

Differential Diagnosis and Treatment

After the diagnosis of hyperaldosteronism is established, the next step is to use adrenal imaging to further assess the cause. Fine-cut CT scanning of the adrenal region is the method of choice as it provides excellent visualization of adrenal morphology. CT will readily identify larger tumors suspicious of malignancy but may miss lesions smaller than 5 mm. The differentiation between bilateral micronodular hyperplasia and a unilateral adenoma is only required if a surgical approach is feasible and desired. Consequently, selective adrenal vein sampling (AVS) should only be carried out in surgical candidates with either no obvious lesion on CT or evidence of a unilateral lesion in patients older than 40 years, as the latter patients have a high likelihood of harboring a coincidental, endocrine inactive adrenal adenoma (Fig. 342-11). AVS is used to compare aldosterone levels in the inferior vena cava and between the right and left adrenal veins. AVS requires concurrent measurement of cortisol to document correct placement of the catheter in the adrenal veins and should demonstrate a cortisol gradient >3 between the vena cava and each adrenal vein. Lateralization is confirmed by an aldosterone/cortisol ratio that is at least twofold higher on one side than the other. AVS is a complex procedure that requires a highly skilled interventional radiologist. Even then, the right adrenal vein can be difficult to cannulate correctly, which invalidates the procedure. There is also no agreement as to whether the two adrenal veins should be cannulated simultaneously or successively and whether ACTH stimulation enhances the diagnostic value of AVS.

Patients younger than 40 years with confirmed mineralocorticoid excess and a unilateral lesion can go straight to surgery, which is also indicated in patients with confirmed lateralization documented by a valid AVS procedure. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is the preferred approach. Patients who are not surgical candidates, or with evidence of bilateral hyperplasia based on CT or AVS, should be treated medically (Fig. 342-11). Medical treatment, which can also be considered prior to surgery to avoid postsurgical hypoaldosteronism, consists primarily of the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone. It can be started at 12.5每50 mg bid and titrated up to a maximum of 400 mg/d to control blood pressure and normalize potassium. Side effects include menstrual irregularity, decreased libido, and gynecomastia. The more selective MR antagonist eplerenone can also be used. Doses start at 25 mg bid and it can be titrated up to 200 mg/d. Another useful drug is the sodium channel blocker amiloride (5每10 mg/bid).

In patients with normal adrenal morphology and family history of early-onset, severe hypertension, a diagnosis of GRA should be considered and can be evaluated using genetic testing. Treatment of GRA consists of administering dexamethasone, using the lowest dose possible to control blood pressure. Some patients also require additional MR antagonist treatment.

The diagnosis of nonaldosterone-related mineralocorticoid excess is based on documentation of suppressed renin and suppressed aldosterone in the presence of hypokalemic hypertension. This testing is best carried out by employing urinary steroid metabolite profiling by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). An increased free cortisol over free cortisone ratio is suggestive of AME and can be treated with dexamethasone. Steroid profiling by GC/MS also detects the steroids associated with CYP11B1 and CYP17A1 deficiency or the irregular steroid secretion pattern in a DOC-producing adrenocortical carcinoma (Fig. 342-11). If the GC/MS profile is normal, then Liddle's syndrome should be considered. It is very sensitive to amiloride treatment but will not respond to MR antagonist treatment, as the defect is due to a constitutively active ENaC.

Approach to the Patient: Incidentally Discovered Adrenal Mass

Epidemiology

Incidentally discovered adrenal masses, commonly termed adrenal "incidentalomas," are common, with a prevalence of at least 2% in the general population as documented in CT and autopsy series. The prevalence increases with age, with 1% of 40-year-olds and 7% of 70-year-olds harboring an adrenal mass.

Etiology

Most solitary adrenal tumors are monoclonal neoplasms. Several genetic syndromes, including MEN-1 (MEN1), MEN-2 (RET), Carney's complex (PRKAR1A), and McCune-Albright (GNAS1), can have adrenal tumors as one of their features. Somatic mutations in MEN1, GNAS1, and PRKAR1A have been identified in a small proportion of sporadic adrenocortical adenomas. Aberrant expression of membrane receptors (gastric inhibitory peptide, -adrenergic, luteinizing hormone, vasopressin V1 and interleukin-I receptors) have been identified in some sporadic cases of macronodular adrenocortical hyperplasia.

The majority of adrenal nodules are endocrine inactive adrenocortical adenomas. However, larger series suggest that up to 25% of adrenal nodules are hormonally active, due to a cortisol- or aldosterone-producing adrenocortical adenoma or a pheochromocytoma associated with catecholamine excess (Table 342-5). Adrenocortical carcinoma is rare but it is the cause of an adrenal mass in 5% of patients. However, the most common cause of a malignant adrenal mass is metastasis originating from another solid tissue tumor (Table 342-5).

Differential Diagnosis and Treatment

Patients with an adrenal mass >1 cm require a diagnostic evaluation. Two key questions need to be addressed: (1) Does the tumor autonomously secrete hormones that could have a detrimental effect on health?, and (2) Is the adrenal mass benign or malignant?

Hormone secretion by an adrenal mass occurs along a continuum, with a gradual increase in clinical manifestations in parallel with hormone levels. Exclusion of catecholamine excess from a pheochromocytoma arising from the adrenal medulla is a mandatory part of the diagnostic workup (Fig. 342-12). Furthermore, autonomous cortisol and aldosterone secretion resulting in Cushing's syndrome or primary hyperaldosteronism, respectively, require exclusion. Adrenal incidentalomas are associated with lower levels of autonomous cortisol secretion, and patients may lack overt clinical features of Cushing's syndrome. Nonetheless, they may exhibit one or more components of the metabolic syndrome (e.g., obesity, type 2 diabetes, or hypertension). There is ongoing debate about the optimal treatment for these patients with mild or subclinical Cushing's syndrome. Overproduction of adrenal androgen precursors, DHEA and its sulfate, is rare and is most frequently seen in the context of adrenocortical carcinoma, as are increased levels of steroid precursors such as 17-hydroxyprogesterone.

For the differentiation of benign from malignant adrenal masses, imaging is relatively sensitive though specificity is suboptimal. CT is the procedure of choice for imaging the adrenal glands (Fig. 342-12). The risk of adrenocortical carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and benign adrenal myelolipoma increases with the diameter of the adrenal mass. However, size alone is of poor predictive value, with only 80% sensitivity and 60% specificity for the differentiation of benign from malignant masses when using a 4-cm cut-off. Metastases are found with similar frequency in adrenal masses of all sizes. Tumor density on unenhanced CT is of additional diagnostic value, with most adrenocortical adenomas being lipid rich and thus presenting with low attenuation values [i.e., densities of <10 Hounsfield Units (HU)]. By contrast, adrenocortical carcinomas, but also pheochromocytomas, usually have high attenuation values (i.e. densities >20 HU on precontrast scans). Generally, benign lesions are rounded and homogenous whereas most malignant lesions appear lobulated and inhomogeneous. Pheochromocytoma and adrenomyelolipoma may also exhibit lobulated and inhomogeneous features. Additional information can be obtained from CT by assessment of contrast wash-out after 15 minutes, which is >50% in benign lesions but <40% in malignant lesions, which usually have a more extensive vascularization. MRI also allows for the visualization of the adrenal glands with somewhat lower resolution than CT. However, as it does not involve exposure to ionizing radiation, it is preferred in children, young adults, and during pregnancy. MRI has a valuable role in the characterization of indeterminate adrenal lesions using chemical shift analysis, with malignant tumors rarely showing loss of signal on opposed-phase MRI.

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or CT-guided biopsy of an adrenal mass is almost never indicated. FNA of a pheochromocytoma can cause a life-threatening hypertensive crisis. FNA of an adrenocortical carcinoma violates the tumor capsule. FNA should only be considered in a patient with a history of nonadrenal malignancy and a newly detected adrenal mass. FNA should be carried out only after careful exclusion of pheochromocytoma and if the outcome will influence therapeutic management. It is important to recognize that in 25% of patients with a previous history of nonadrenal malignancy, a newly detected mass on CT is not a metastasis.

Adrenal masses associated with confirmed hormone excess or suspected malignancy are usually treated surgically (Fig. 342-12) or, if adrenalectomy is not feasible or desired, with medication. Preoperative exclusion of glucocorticoid excess is particularly important for the prediction of postoperative suppression of the contralateral adrenal gland, which requires glucocorticoid replacement before surgery. If the initial decision is for observation, imaging and biochemical testing should be repeated about a year after the first assessment. However, this may be performed earlier in patients with borderline imaging or hormonal findings. There is no agreement with regard to the required long-term follow-up beyond 1 year and in patients with normal biochemistry and no evidence of increased tumor size at follow-up.

Adrenocortical Carcinoma

Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignancy with an annual incidence of 1每2 per million population. ACC is generally considered a highly malignant tumor; however, it presents with broad interindividual variability with regard to biologic characteristics and clinical behavior. Somatic mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 are found in 25% of apparently sporadic ACC. Germline TP53 mutations are the cause of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome associated with multiple solid organ cancers including ACC and are found in 25% of pediatric ACC cases; the TP53 mutation R337H is found in almost all pediatric ACC in Brazil. Other genetic changes identified in ACC include alterations in the Wnt/-catenin pathway and in the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) cluster; IGF2 overexpression is found in 90% of ACC.

Patients with large adrenal tumors suspicious of malignancy should be managed by a multidisciplinary specialist team, including an endocrinologist, an oncologist, a surgeon, a radiologist, and a histopathologist. FNA is not indicated in suspected ACC: first, cytology and also histopathology of a core biopsy cannot differentiate between benign and malignant primary adrenal masses; second, FNA violates the tumor capsule and may even cause needle canal metastasis. Even when the entire tumor specimen is available, the histopathologic differentiation between benign and malignant lesions is a diagnostic challenge. The most common histopathologic classification is the Weiss score, taking into account high nuclear grade; mitotic rate (>5/HPF); atypical mitosis; <25% clear cells; diffuse architecture; and presence of necrosis, venous invasion, and invasion of sinusoidal structures and tumor capsule. The presence of three or more elements suggests ACC.

Although 60每70% of ACCs are biochemically found to overproduce hormones, this is not clinically apparent in many patients due to the relatively inefficient steroid production by the adrenocortical cancer cells. Excess production of glucocorticoids and adrenal androgen precursors are most common. Mixed excess production of several corticosteroid classes by an adrenal tumor is generally indicative of malignancy.

Tumor staging at diagnosis (Table 342-6) has important prognostic implications and requires scanning of the chest and abdomen for local organ invasion, lymphadenopathy, and metastases. Intravenous contrast medium is necessary for maximum sensitivity for hepatic metastases. An adrenal origin may be difficult to determine on standard axial CT imaging if the tumors are large and invasive, but CT reconstructions or MRI are more informative (Fig. 342-13) using multiple planes and different sequences. Vascular and adjacent organ invasion is diagnostic of malignancy. 18-Fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucosepositron emission tomography (18-FDG PET) is highly sensitive for the detection of malignancy and can be used to detect small metastases or local recurrence that may not be obvious on CT (Fig. 342-13). However, FDG PET is not specific and therefore cannot be used for differentiating benign from malignant adrenal lesions. Metastasis in ACC most frequently occurs to liver and lung.

ACC carries a poor prognosis and cure can be achieved only by complete surgical removal. Capsule violation during primary surgery, metastasis at diagnosis, and primary treatment in a nonspecialist center are major determinants of poor survival. If the primary tumor invades adjacent organs, en bloc removal of kidney and spleen should be considered to reduce the risk of recurrence. Surgery can also be considered in a patient with metastases if there is severe tumor-related hormone excess. This indication needs to be carefully weighed against surgical risk, including thromboembolic complications, and the resulting delay in the introduction of other therapeutic options. Patients with confirmed ACC and successful removal of the primary tumor should receive adjuvant treatment with mitotane (o,p'DDD), particularly in patients with a high risk of recurrence as determined by tumor size >8 cm, histopathologic signs of vascular invasion, capsule invasion or violation, and a Ki67 proliferation index 10%. Mitotane is usually started at 500 mg qid, with doses increased by 1000 mg/d every 1每2 weeks as tolerated. The maximum tolerated dose is usually 8每10 g/m2 per day. Adjuvant mitotane should be continued for at least 2 years, if the patient can tolerate side effects. Regular monitoring of plasma mitotane levels is mandatory (therapeutic range 14每20 mg/L; neurotoxic complications more frequent >20 mg/L), as is concurrent replacement with hydrocortisone. The latter should be given at higher doses than usually employed in adrenal insufficiency (e.g., 20 mg tid), as mitotane increases glucocorticoid inactivation due to the induction of hepatic CYP3A4 activity. It also increases circulating cortisol-binding globulin, thereby decreasing the available free cortisol fraction. Single metastases can be addressed surgically or with radiofrequency ablation as appropriate. If the tumor recurs or progresses during mitotane treatment, chemotherapy should be considered (e.g., cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin plus continuing mitotane, the so-called Berrutti regimen); painful bone metastasis responds to irradiation. Overall survival in ACC is still poor, with 5-year survival rates of 30每40%.

Adrenal Insufficiency

Epidemiology

The prevalence of well-documented, permanent adrenal insufficiency is 5 in 10,000 in the general population. Hypothalamic-pituitary origin of disease is most frequent, with a prevalence of 3 in 10,000, whereas primary adrenal insufficiency has a prevalence of 2 in 10,000. Approximately one-half of the latter cases are acquired, mostly caused by autoimmune destruction of the adrenal glands; the other one-half are genetic, most commonly caused by distinct enzymatic blocks in adrenal steroidogenesis affecting glucocorticoid synthesis (i.e. congenital adrenal hyperplasia.)

Adrenal insufficiency arising from suppression of the HPA axis as a consequence of exogenous glucocorticoid treatment is much more common, occurring in 0.5每2% of the population in developed countries.

Etiology

Primary adrenal insufficiency is most commonly caused by autoimmune adrenalitis. Isolated autoimmune adrenalitis accounts for 30每40%, whereas 60每70% develop adrenal insufficiency as part of autoimmune polyglandular syndromes (APS) (Chap. 351) (Table 342-7). APS1, also termed APECED (autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy), is the underlying cause in 10% of patients affected by APS. APS1 is transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator gene AIRE. Associated autoimmune conditions overlap with those seen in APS2, but may also include total alopecia, primary hypoparathyroidism, and, in rare cases, lymphoma. APS1 patients invariably develop chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, usually manifest in childhood, and preceding adrenal insufficiency by years or decades. The much more prevalent APS2 is of polygenic inheritance, with confirmed associations with the HLA-DR3 gene region in the major histocompatibility complex and distinct gene regions involved in immune regulation (CTLA-4, PTPN22, CLEC16A). Coincident autoimmune disease most frequently includes thyroid autoimmune disease, vitiligo, and premature ovarian failure. Less commonly, additional features may include type 1 diabetes and pernicious anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency.

X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy has an incidence of 1:20,000 males and is caused by mutations in the X-ALD gene encoding the peroxisomal membrane transporter protein ABCD1; its disruption results in accumulation of very long chain (>24 carbon atoms) fatty acids. Approximately 50% of cases manifest in early childhood with rapidly progressive white matter disease (cerebral ALD); 35% present during adolescence or in early adulthood with neurologic features indicative of myelin and peripheral nervous system involvement (adrenomyeloneuropathy, AMN). In the remaining 15%, adrenal insufficiency is the sole manifestation of disease. Of note, distinct mutations manifest with variable penetrance within affected families.

Rarer causes of adrenal insufficiency involve destruction of the adrenal glands as a consequence of infection, hemorrhage, or infiltration (Table 342-7); tuberculous adrenalitis is still a frequent cause of disease in developing countries. Adrenal metastases rarely cause adrenal insufficiency, and this occurs only with bilateral, bulky metastases.

Inborn causes of primary adrenal insufficiency other than congenital adrenal hyperplasia are rare, causing less than 1% of cases. However, their elucidation provides important insights into adrenal gland development and physiology. Mutations causing primary adrenal insufficiency (Table 342-7) include factors regulating adrenal development and steroidogenesis (DAX-1, SF-1), cholesterol synthesis, import and cleavage (DHCR7, StAR, CYP11A1), and elements of the adrenal ACTH response pathway (MC2R, MRAP) (Fig. 342-5).

Secondary adrenal insufficiency is the consequence of dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary component of the HPA axis (Table 342-8). Excluding iatrogenic suppression, the overwhelming majority of cases are caused by pituitary or hypothalamic tumors, or their treatment by surgery or irradiation (Chap. 339). Rarer causes include pituitary apoplexy, either as a consequence of an infarcted pituitary adenoma or transient reduction in the blood supply of the pituitary during surgery or after rapid blood loss associated with parturition, also termed Sheehan's syndrome. Isolated ACTH deficiency is rarely caused by autoimmune disease or pituitary infiltration (Table 342-8). Mutations in the ACTH precursor POMC or in factors regulating pituitary development are genetic causes of ACTH deficiency (Table 342-8).

Clinical Manifestations

In principle, the clinical features of primary adrenal insufficiency are characterized by the loss of both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid secretion (Table 342-9). In secondary adrenal insufficiency, only glucocorticoid deficiency is present, as the adrenal itself is intact and thus still amenable to regulation by the RAA system. Adrenal androgen secretion is disrupted in both primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency (Table 342-9). Hypothalamic-pituitary disease can lead to additional clinical manifestations due to involvement of other endocrine axes (thyroid, gonads, growth hormone, prolactin) or visual impairment with bitemporal hemianopia caused by chiasmal compression. It is important to recognize that iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency caused by exogenous glucocorticoid suppression of the HPA axis may result in all symptoms associated with glucocorticoid deficiency (Table 342-9), if exogenous glucocorticoids are stopped abruptly. However, patients will appear clinically Cushingoid as a result of the preceding overexposure to glucocorticoids.

Chronic adrenal insufficiency manifests with relatively nonspecific signs and symptoms such as fatigue and loss of energy, often resulting in delayed or missed diagnoses (e.g., as depression or anorexia). A distinguishing feature of primary adrenal insufficiency is hyperpigmentation, which is caused by excess ACTH stimulation of melanocytes. Hyperpigmentation is most pronounced in skin areas exposed to increased friction or shear stress and is increased by sunlight (Fig. 342-14). Conversely, in secondary adrenal insufficiency, the skin has an alabaster-like paleness due to lack of ACTH secretion.

Clinical features of Addison's disease. Note the hyperpigmentation in areas of increased friction including (A) palmar creases, (B) dorsal foot, (C) nipples and axillary region, and (D) patchy hyperpigmentation of the oral mucosa.
 
 

Hyponatremia is a characteristic biochemical feature in primary adrenal insufficiency and is found in 80% of patients at presentation. Hyperkalemia is present in 40% of patients at initial diagnosis. Hyponatremia is primarily caused by mineralocorticoid deficiency but can also occur in secondary adrenal insufficiency due to diminished inhibition of ADH by cortisol, resulting in mild syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Glucocorticoid deficiency also results in slightly increased TSH concentrations that normalize within days to weeks after initiation of glucocorticoid replacement.

Acute adrenal insufficiency usually occurs after a prolonged period of nonspecific complaints and is more frequently observed in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency, due to the loss of both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid secretion. Postural hypotension may progress to hypovolemic shock. Adrenal insufficiency may mimic features of acute abdomen with abdominal tenderness, nausea, vomiting, and fever. In some cases, the primary presentation may resemble neurologic disease, with decreased responsiveness, progressing to stupor and coma. An adrenal crisis can be triggered by an intercurrent illness, surgical or other stress, or increased glucocorticoid inactivation (e.g., hyperthyroidism).

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is established by the short cosyntropin test, a safe and reliable tool with excellent predictive diagnostic value (Fig. 342-15). The cut-off for failure is usually defined at cortisol levels of <500每550 nmol/L (18每20 g/dL) sampled 30每60 minutes after ACTH stimulation; the exact cut-off is dependent on the locally available assay. During the early phase of HPA disruption (e.g., within 4 weeks of pituitary insufficiency), patients may still respond to exogenous ACTH stimulation. In this circumstance, the insulin tolerance test is an alternative choice but is more invasive and should be carried out only under a specialist's supervision (see above). Induction of hypoglycemia is contraindicated in individuals with diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, or history of seizures. Random serum cortisol measurements are of limited diagnostic value, as baseline cortisol levels may be coincidentally low due to the physiologic diurnal rhythm of cortisol secretion (Fig. 342-3). Similarly, many patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency have relatively normal baseline cortisol levels but fail to mount an appropriate cortisol response to ACTH, which can only be revealed by stimulation testing. Importantly, tests to establish the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency should never delay treatment. Thus, in a patient with suspected adrenal crisis, it is reasonable to draw baseline cortisol levels, provide replacement therapy, and defer formal stimulation testing until a later time.

Figure 342-15

Once adrenal insufficiency is confirmed, measurement of plasma ACTH is the next step, with increased or inappropriately low levels defining primary and secondary origin of disease, respectively (Fig. 342-15). In primary adrenal insufficiency, increased plasma renin will confirm the presence of mineralocorticoid deficiency. At initial presentation, patients with primary adrenal insufficiency should undergo screening for steroid autoantibodies as a marker of autoimmune adrenalitis. If these tests are negative, adrenal imaging by CT is indicated to investigate possible hemorrhage, infiltration, or masses. In male patients with negative autoantibodies in the plasma, very long chain fatty acids should be measured to exclude X-ALD. Patients with inappropriately low ACTH, in the presence of confirmed cortisol deficiency, should undergo hypothalamic-pituitary imaging by MRI. Features suggestive of preceding pituitary apoplexy such as sudden-onset severe headache, or history of previous head trauma, should be carefully explored, particularly in patients with no obvious MRI lesion.

Treatment: Acute Adrenal Insufficiency

Acute adrenal insufficiency requires immediate initiation of rehydration, usually carried out by saline infusion at initial rates of 1 L/h with continuous cardiac monitoring. Glucocorticoid replacement should be initiated by bolus injection of 100 mg hydrocortisone, followed by the administration of 100每200 mg hydrocortisone over 24 h, either by continuous infusion or provided by several IV or IM injections. Mineralocorticoid replacement can be initiated once the daily hydrocortisone dose has been reduced to <50 mg because at higher doses hydrocortisone provides sufficient stimulation of mineralocorticoid receptors.

Glucocorticoid replacement for the treatment of chronic adrenal insufficiency should be administered at a dose that replaces the physiologic daily cortisol production, which is usually achieved by the oral administration of 15每25 mg hydrocortisone in two to three divided doses. Pregnancy may require an increase in hydrocortisone dose by 50% during the last trimester. In all patients, at least one-half of the daily dose should be administered in the morning. Currently available glucocorticoid preparations fail to mimic the physiologic cortisol secretion rhythm (Fig. 342-3). Long-acting glucocorticoids such as prednisolone or dexamethasone are not preferred as they result in increased glucocorticoid exposure due to extended glucocorticoid receptor activation at times of physiologically low cortisol secretion. There are no well-established dose equivalencies, but as a guide, equipotency can be assumed for 1 mg hydrocortisone, 1.6 mg cortisone acetate, 0.2 mg prednisolone, 0.25 mg prednisone, and 0.025 mg dexamethasone.

Monitoring of glucocorticoid replacement is mainly based on the history and examination for signs and symptoms suggestive of glucocorticoid over- or under-replacement, including assessment of body weight and blood pressure. Plasma ACTH, 24-hour urinary free cortisol, or serum cortisol day curves reflect whether hydrocortisone has been taken or not, but do not convey reliable information about replacement quality. In patients with isolated primary adrenal insufficiency, monitoring should include screening for autoimmune thyroid disease, and female patients should be made aware of the possibility of premature ovarian failure. Supraphysiologic glucocorticoid treatment with doses equivalent to 30 mg hydrocortisone or more will affect bone metabolism, and these patients should undergo regular bone mineral density evaluation. All patients with adrenal insufficiency need to be instructed about the requirement for stress-related glucocorticoid dose adjustments. These generally consist of doubling the routine oral glucocorticoid dose in the case of intercurrent illness with fever and bedrest and the need for IV hydrocortisone injection at a daily dose of 100 mg in cases of prolonged vomiting, surgery, or trauma. Patients living or traveling in regions with delayed access to acute health care should carry a hydrocortisone self-injection emergency kit, in addition to their usual steroid emergency cards and bracelets.

Mineralocorticoid replacement in primary adrenal insufficiency should be initiated at a dose of 100每150 g fludrocortisone. The adequacy of treatment can be evaluated by measuring blood pressure, sitting and standing, to detect a postural drop indicative of hypovolemia. In addition, serum sodium, potassium, and plasma renin should be measured regularly. Renin levels should be kept in the upper normal reference range. Changes in glucocorticoid dose may also impact on mineralocorticoid replacement as cortisol also binds the mineralocorticoid receptor; 40 mg hydrocortisone is equivalent to 100 g fludrocortisone. In patients living or traveling in areas with hot or tropical weather conditions, the fludrocortisone dose should be increased by 50每100 g during the summer. Mineralocorticoid dose may also need to be adjusted during pregnancy, due to the antimineralocorticoid activity of progesterone, but this is less often required than hydrocortisone dose adjustment. Plasma renin cannot serve as a monitoring tool during pregnancy, as renin rises physiologically during gestation.

Adrenal androgen replacement is an option in patients with lack of energy, despite optimized glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement. It may also be indicated in women with features of androgen deficiency, including loss of libido. Adrenal androgen replacement can be achieved by once-daily administration of 25每50 mg DHEA. Treatment is monitored by measurement of DHEAS, androstenedione, testosterone, and SHBG 24 hours after the last DHEA dose.

Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia

(See also Chap. 349) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is caused by mutations in genes encoding steroidogenic enzymes involved in glucocorticoid synthesis (CYP21A2, CYP17A1, HSD3B2, CYP11B1) or in the cofactor enzyme P450 oxidoreductase that serves as an electron donor to CYP21A2 and CYP17A1 (Fig. 342-1). Invariably, patients affected by CAH exhibit glucocorticoid deficiency. Depending on the exact step of enzymatic block, they may also have excess production mineralocorticoids or deficient production of sex steroids (Table 342-10). The diagnosis of CAH is readily established by measurement of the steroids accumulating before the distinct enzymatic block, either in serum or in urine, preferably by the use of mass spectrometry每based assays (Table 342-10).

Mutations in CYP21A2 are the most prevalent cause of CAH, responsible for 90每95% of cases. 21-Hydroxylase deficiency disrupts glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid synthesis (Fig. 342-1), resulting in diminished negative feedback via the HPA axis. This leads to increased pituitary ACTH release, which drives increased synthesis of adrenal androgen precursors and subsequent androgen excess. The degree of impairment of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid secretion depends on the severity of mutations. Major loss-of-function mutations result in combined glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiency (classic CAH, neonatal presentation), whereas less severe mutations affect glucocorticoid synthesis only (simple virilizing CAH, neonatal or early childhood presentation). The mildest mutations result in the least severe clinical phenotype, nonclassical CAH, usually presenting during adolescence and early adulthood and with preserved glucocorticoid production.

Androgen excess is present in all patients and manifests with broad phenotypic variability, ranging from severe virilization of the external genitalia in neonatal girls (e.g., 46,XX DSD) to hirsutism and oligomenorrhea resembling a polycystic ovary syndrome phenotype in young women with nonclassic CAH. In countries without neonatal screening for CAH, boys with classic CAH usually present with life-threatening adrenal crisis in the first few weeks of life (salt-wasting crisis); a simple-virilizing genotype manifests with precocious pseudo-puberty and advanced bone age in early childhood, whereas men with nonclassic CAH are usually detected only through family screening.

Glucocorticoid treatment is more complex than for other causes of primary adrenal insufficiency. It not only needs to replace missing glucocorticoids but also aims to suppress the increased ACTH drive and subsequent androgen excess. Current treatment is hampered by the lack of glucocorticoid preparations that mimic the diurnal cortisol secretion profile, resulting in a prolonged period of ACTH stimulation and subsequent androgen production during the early morning hours. In childhood, optimization of growth and pubertal development are important goals of glucocorticoid treatment, in addition to prevention of adrenal crisis and treatment of 46,XX DSD. In adults, the focus shifts to preserving fertility and preventing side effects of glucocorticoid overtreatment, namely, the metabolic syndrome and osteoporosis. Fertility can be compromised in women due to oligo/amenorrhea with chronic anovulation as a consequence of androgen excess. Men may develop so-called testicular adrenal rest tumors (Fig. 342-16). These consist of hyperplastic cells with adrenocortical characteristics located in the rete testis and should not be confused with testicular tumors. Testicular adrenal rest tumors can compromise sperm production and induce fibrosis that may be irreversible.

Treatment: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia

Hydrocortisone is a good treatment option for the prevention of adrenal crisis but longer-acting prednisolone may be needed to control androgen excess. In children, hydrocortisone is given in divided doses at 1每1.5 times the normal cortisol production rate (about 10每13 mg/m2 per day). In adults, intermediate-acting glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) may be given, using the lowest dose necessary to suppress excess androgen production. For achieving fertility, dexamethasone treatment may be required, but should be only given for the shortest possible time period to limit metabolic side effects. Biochemical monitoring should include androstenedione and testosterone, aiming for the normal sex-specific reference range. 17-Hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) is a useful marker of overtreatment, indicated by 17OHP levels within the normal range of healthy controls. Glucocorticoid overtreatment may suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Thus, treatment needs to be carefully titrated against clinical features of disease control. Stress dose glucocorticoids should be given at double or triple the daily dose for surgery, acute illness, or severe trauma. Poorly controlled CAH can result in adrenocortical hyperplasia, which gave the disease its name, and may present as macronodular hyperplasia subsequent to long-standing ACTH excess (Fig. 342-15). The nodular areas can develop autonomous adrenal androgen production, and may be unresponsive to glucocorticoid treatment.

Mineralocorticoid requirements change during life and are higher in children, explained by relative mineralocorticoid resistance that diminishes with ongoing maturation of the kidney. Children with CAH usually receive mineralocorticoid and salt replacement. However, young adults with CAH should undergo reassessment of their mineralocorticoid reserve. Plasma renin should be regularly monitored and kept within the upper half of the normal reference range.

Chapter 343. Pheochromocytoma >
 

Pheochromocytoma: Introduction

Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are catecholamine- producing tumors derived from the sympathetic or parasympathetic nervous system. These tumors may arise sporadically or be inherited as features of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 or several other pheochromocytoma-associated syndromes. The diagnosis of pheochromocytomas provides a potentially correctable cause of hypertension, and their removal can prevent hypertensive crises that can be lethal. The clinical presentation is variable, ranging from an adrenal incidentaloma to a patient in hypertensive crisis with associated cerebrovascular or cardiac complications.

Epidemiology

Pheochromocytoma is estimated to occur in 2每8 of 1 million persons per year, and about 0.1% of hypertensive patients harbor a pheochromocytoma. Autopsy series reveal prevalence of 0.2%. The mean age at diagnosis is about 40 years, although the tumors can occur from early childhood until late in life. The "rule of tens" for pheochromocytomas states that about 10% are bilateral, 10% are extraadrenal, and 10% are malignant. However, these percentages are higher in the inherited syndromes.

Etiology and Pathogenesis

Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are well-vascularized tumors that arise from cells derived from the sympathetic (e.g., adrenal medulla) or parasympathetic (e.g., carotid body, glomus vagale) paraganglia (Fig. 343-1). The name pheochromocytoma reflects the black-colored staining caused by chromaffin oxidation of catecholamines. Although a variety of terms have been used to describe these tumors, most clinicians use the term pheochromocytoma to describe symptomatic catecholamine-producing tumors, including those in extraadrenal retroperitoneal, pelvic, and thoracic sites. The term paraganglioma is used to describe catecholamine-producing tumors in the head and neck. These tumors may secrete little or no catecholamines.

Washington, DC, AFIP, 1974.]
 
 

The etiology of sporadic pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas is unknown. However, about 25% of patients have an inherited condition, including germ-line mutations in the RET, VHL, NF1, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, or SDHAF2 genes. Biallelic gene inactivation has been demonstrated for the VHL, NF1, and SDH genes, whereas RET mutations activate the receptor tyrosine kinase activity. SDH is an enzyme of the Krebs cycle and the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The VHL protein is a component of a ubiquitin E3 ligase. VHL mutations reduce protein degradation, resulting in upregulation of components involved in cell cycle progression, glucose metabolism, and oxygen sensing.

Clinical Features

The clinical presentation is so variable that pheochromocytoma has been termed "the great masquerader" (Table 343-1). Among the presenting symptoms, episodes of palpitations, headaches, and profuse sweating are typical and constitute a classic triad. The presence of all three symptoms in association with hypertension makes pheochromocytoma a likely diagnosis. However, a pheochromocytoma can be asymptomatic for years, and some tumors grow to a considerable size before patients note symptoms.

Table 343-1 Clinical Features Associated with Pheochromocytoma

 
 
Headaches 
Sweating attacks 
Palpitations and tachycardia 
Hypertension, sustained or paroxysmal 
Anxiety and panic attacks 
Pallor 
Nausea 
Abdominal pain 
Weakness

Paradoxical response to antihypertensive drugs 
Polyuria and polydipsia

Orthostatic hypotension 
Dilated cardiomyopathy 
Erythrocytosis 
Elevated blood sugar 
Hypercalcemia 
 

 

The dominant sign is hypertension. Classically, patients have episodic hypertension, but sustained hypertension is also common. Catecholamine crises can lead to heart failure, pulmonary edema, arrhythmias, and intracranial hemorrhage. During episodes of hormone release, which can occur at very divergent intervals, patients are anxious and pale, and they experience tachycardia and palpitations. These paroxysms generally last less than an hour and may be precipitated by surgery, positional changes, exercise, pregnancy, urination (particularly bladder pheochromocytomas), and various medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, opiates, metoclopramide).

Diagnosis

The diagnosis is based on documentation of catecholamine excess by biochemical testing and localization of the tumor by imaging. Both are of equal importance, although measurement of catecholamines is traditionally the first step.

Biochemical Testing

Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas synthesize and store catecholamines, which include norepinephrine (noradrenaline), epinephrine (adrenaline), and dopamine. Elevated plasma and urinary levels of catecholamines and the methylated metabolites, metanephrines, are the cornerstone for the diagnosis. The hormonal activity of tumors fluctuates, resulting in considerable variation in serial catecholamine measurements. Thus, there is some value in obtaining tests during or soon after a symptomatic crisis. However, most tumors continuously leak O-methylated metabolites, which are detected by measurements of metanephrines.

Catecholamines and metanephrines can be measured by using different methods (e.g., high-performance liquid chromatography, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry). In a clinical context suspicious for pheochromocytoma, when values are increased three times the upper limit of normal, a pheochromocytoma is highly likely regardless of the assay used. However, as summarized in Table 343-2, the sensitivity and specificity of available biochemical tests vary greatly, and these differences are important in assessing patients with borderline elevations of different compounds. Urinary tests for vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), metanephrines (total or fractionated), and catecholamines are widely available and are used commonly for initial testing. Among these tests, the fractionated metanephrines and catecholamines are the most sensitive. Plasma tests are more convenient and include measurements of catecholamines and metanephrines. Measurements of plasma metanephrine are the most sensitive and are less susceptible to false-positive elevations from stress, including venipuncture. Although the incidence of false-positive test results has been reduced by the introduction of newer assays, physiologic stress responses and medications that increase catecholamines still can confound testing. Because the tumors are relatively rare, borderline elevations are likely to be false positives. In this circumstance, it is important to exclude diet or drug exposure (withdrawal of levodopa, sympathomimetics, diuretics, tricyclic antidepressants, alpha and beta blockers) that might cause false positives and then repeat testing or perform a clonidine suppression test (measurement of plasma metanephrines 3 h after oral administration of 300 g of clonidine). Other pharmacologic tests, such as the phentolamine test and the glucagon provocation test, are of relatively low sensitivity and are not recommended.

Diagnostic Imaging

A variety of methods have been used to localize pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (Table 343-2). CT and MRI are similar in sensitivity. CT should be performed with contrast. T2-weighted MRI with gadolinium contrast is optimal for detecting pheochromocytomas and is somewhat better than CT for imaging extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. About 5% of adrenal incidentalomas, which usually are detected by CT or MRI, prove to be pheochromocytomas after endocrinologic evaluation.

Tumors also can be localized by using radioactive tracers, including 131I- or 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), 111In-somatostatin analogues, or 18F-dopa (or dopamine) positron emission tomography (PET). Because these agents exhibit selective uptake in paragangliomas, nuclear imaging is particularly useful in the hereditary syndromes.

Differential Diagnosis

When one is entertaining the possibility of a pheochromocytoma, other disorders to consider include essential hypertension, anxiety attacks, use of cocaine or amphetamines, mastocytosis or carcinoid syndrome (usually lacking hypertension), intracranial lesions, clonidine withdrawal, autonomic epilepsy, and factitious crises (usually from sympathomimetic amines). When an asymptomatic adrenal mass is identified, likely diagnoses other than pheochromocytoma include a nonfunctioning adrenal adenoma, aldosteronoma, and cortisol-producing adenoma (Cushing's syndrome).

Treatment: Pheochromocytoma

Complete tumor removal is the ultimate therapeutic goal. Preoperative patient preparation is essential for safe surgery. -Adrenergic blockers (phenoxybenzamine) should be initiated at relatively low doses (e.g., 5每10 mg orally three times per day) and increased as tolerated every few days. Because patients are volume-constricted, liberal salt intake and hydration are necessary to avoid orthostasis. Adequate alpha blockade generally requires 7 days, with a typical final dose of 20每30 mg phenoxybenzamine three times per day. Oral prazosin or intravenous phentolamine can be used to manage paroxysms while awaiting adequate alpha blockade. Before surgery, blood pressure should be consistently below 160/90 mmHg, with moderate orthostasis. Beta blockers (e.g., 10 mg propranolol three to four times per day) can be added after starting alpha blockers and increased as needed if tachycardia persists. Other antihypertensives, such as calcium channel blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, have been used when blood pressure is difficult to control with phenoxybenzamine alone.

Surgery should be performed by teams of anesthesiologists and surgeons with experience in the management of pheochromocytomas. Blood pressure can be labile during surgery, particularly at the onset of intubation or when the tumor is manipulated. Nitroprusside infusion is useful for intraoperative hypertensive crises, and hypotension usually responds to volume infusion. Although laparotomy was the traditional surgical approach, endoscopic surgery, using either a transperitoneal or a retroperitoneal approach, is associated with fewer complications, a faster recovery, and optimal cosmetic results. Atraumatic endoscopic surgery has become the method of choice. It may be possible to preserve the normal adrenal cortex, particularly in hereditary disorders in which bilateral pheochromocytomas are more likely. Extra-adrenal abdominal as well as most thoracic pheochromocytomas also can be removed endoscopically. Postoperatively, catecholamine normalization should be documented. An adrenocorticotropic hormone test should be used to exclude cortisol deficiency when bilateral adrenal cortex每sparing surgery is performed.

Malignant Pheochromocytoma

About 5每10% of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are malignant. The diagnosis of malignant pheochromocytoma is problematic. Typical histologic criteria of cellular atypia, presence of mitoses, and invasion of vessels or adjacent tissues do not reliably identify which tumors have the capacity to metastasize. Thus, the term malignant pheochromocytoma generally is restricted to tumors with distant metastases, most commonly found in lungs, bone, or liver, suggesting a vascular pathway of spread. Because hereditary syndromes are associated with multifocal tumor sites, these features should be anticipated in patients with germ-line mutations of RET, VHL, SDHD, or SDHB. However, distant metastases also occur in these syndromes, especially in carriers of SDHB mutations.

Treatment of malignant pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma is challenging. Options include tumor mass reduction, alpha blockers for symptoms, chemotherapy, and nuclear medicine radiotherapy. Averbuch's chemotherapy protocol includes dacarbazine (600 mg/m2 days 1 and 2), cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m2 day 1), and vincristine (1.4 mg/m2 day 1), repeated every 21 days for three to six cycles. Palliation (stable disease to shrinkage) is achieved in about one-half of patients. Other chemotherapeutic protocols remain in the experimental stage. An alternative is 131I-MIBG treatment using 200-mCi doses at monthly intervals over three to six cycles. The prognosis of metastatic pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma is variable, with a 5-year survival of 30每60%.

Pheochromocytoma in Pregnancy

Pheochromocytomas occasionally are diagnosed in pregnancy. Endoscopic removal, preferably in the forth to sixth month of gestation, is possible and can be followed by uneventful childbirth. Regular screening in families with inherited pheochromocytomas provides an opportunity to identify and remove asymptomatic tumors in women of reproductive age.

Pheochromocytoma-Associated Syndromes

About 25每33% of patients with a pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma have an inherited syndrome. The mean age at diagnosis is about 15 years lower in patients with inherited syndromes compared with patients with sporadic tumors.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1) was the first described pheochromocytoma-associated syndrome (Chap. 379). The NF1 gene functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating the Ras signaling cascade. Classic features of neurofibromatosis include multiple neurofibromas, caf谷 au lait spots, axillary freckling of the skin, and Lisch nodules of the iris (Fig. 343-2). Pheochromocytomas occur in only about 1% of these patients and are located predominantly in the adrenals. Malignant pheochromocytoma is not uncommon.

The best-known pheochromocytoma-associated syndrome is the autosomal dominant disorder multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A and type 2B (MEN 2A, MEN 2B) (Chap. 351). Both types of MEN 2 are caused by mutations in RET (REarranged during Transfection), which encodes a tyrosine kinase. The locations of RET mutations correlate with the severity of disease and the type of MEN 2 (Chap. 351). MEN 2A is characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism; MEN 2B also includes MTC and pheochromocytoma, as well as multiple mucosal neuromas, marfanoid habitus, and other developmental disorders, though it typically lacks hyperparathyroidism. MTC is seen in virtually all patients with MEN 2, but pheochromocytoma occurs in only about 50% of these patients. Nearly all pheochromocytomas are benign and located in the adrenals, often bilateral (Fig. 343-3). Pheochromocytoma may be symptomatic before MTC. Prophylactic thyroidectomy is being performed in many carriers of RET mutations; pheochromocytomas should be excluded before any surgery in these patients.

Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) is an autosomal dominant disorder that predisposes to retinal and cerebellar hemangioblastomas, which also occur in the brainstem and spinal cord (Fig. 343-4). Other important features of VHL are clear cell renal carcinomas, pancreatic islet cell tumors, endolymphatic sac tumors (ELSTs) of the inner ear, cystadenomas of the epididymis and broad ligament, and multiple pancreatic or renal cysts.

The VHL gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), among other genes. Loss of VHL is associated with increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that induces angiogenesis. Although the VHL gene can be inactivated by all types of mutations, patients with pheochromocytoma predominantly have missense mutations. About 20每30% of patients with VHL have pheochromocytomas, but in some families the incidence can reach 90%. The recognition of pheochromocytoma as a VHL-associated feature provides an opportunity to diagnose retinal, central nervous system, renal, and pancreatic tumors at a stage when effective treatment may still be possible

The paraganglioma syndromes (PGL) have been classified by genetic analyses of families with head and neck paragangliomas. The susceptibility genes encode subunits of the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), a component in the Krebs cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain. SDH is formed by four subunits (A每D). Mutations of SDHB (PGL4), SDHC (PGL3), SDHD (PGL1), and SDHAF2 (PGL2) predispose to the paraganglioma syndromes. Mutations of SDHA do not predispose to paraganglioma tumors but instead cause Leigh's disease, a form of encephalopathy. The transmission of the disease in carriers of SDHB, SDHC, and SDHAF2 germ-line mutations is autosomal dominant. In contrast, in SDHD families, only the progeny of affected fathers develop tumors if they inherit the mutation. In a small number of patients with familial pheochromocytoma, a mutation has not been identified. PGL1 is most common, followed by PGL4; PGL2 and PGL3 are rare. Adrenal, extra-adrenal abdominal, and thoracic pheochromocytomas that are components of PGL1 and PGL4, are rare in PGL3, but absent in PGL2 (Fig. 343-5). About one-third of the patients with PGL4 develop metastases.

In addition to family history, general features suggesting an inherited syndrome include young age, multifocal tumors, extra-adrenal tumors, and malignant tumors (Fig. 343-6). Because of the relatively high prevalence of familial syndromes among patients who present with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma, it is useful to identify germline mutations even in patients without a known family history. A first step is to search for clinical features of inherited syndromes and to perform an in-depth, multigenerational family history. Each of these syndromes exhibits autosomal dominant transmission with variable penetrance, but a proband with a mother affected by paraganglial tumors is not predisposed to PLG1 (SDHD mutation carrier). Cutaneous neurofibromas, caf谷 au lait spots, and axillary freckling suggest neurofibromatosis. Germ-line mutations in NF1 have not been reported in patients with sporadic pheochromocytomas. Thus, NF1 testing does not have to be performed in the absence of other clinical features of neurofibromatosis. A personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer or elevation of serum calcitonin strongly suggest MEN 2 and should prompt testing for RET mutations. A history of visual impairment, or tumors of the cerebellum, kidney, brainstem, or spinal cord, suggests the possibility of VHL. A personal and/or family history for head and neck paraganglioma suggests PGL1 or PGL4.

A single adrenal pheochromocytoma in a patient with an otherwise unremarkable history may still be associated with mutations of VHL, RET, SDHB, or SDHD (in decreasing order of frequency). Two-thirds of extra-adrenal tumors are associated with one of these syndromes, and multifocal tumors occur with decreasing frequency in carriers of RET, SDHD, VHL, and SDHB mutations. About 30% of head and neck paragangliomas are associated with germ-line mutations of one of the SDH subunit genes (particularly SDHD) and are rare in carriers of VHL and RET mutations.

Once the underlying syndrome is diagnosed, the benefit of genetic testing can be extended to relatives. For this purpose, it is necessary to identify the germ-line mutation in the proband and, after genetic counseling, perform DNA sequence analyses of the responsible gene in relatives to determine whether they are affected (Chap. 63). Other family members may benefit from biochemical screening for paraganglial tumors in individuals who carry a germ-line mutation.

 Chapter 344. Diabetes Mellitus >
 

Diabetes Mellitus: Introduction

Diabetes mellitus (DM) refers to a group of common metabolic disorders that share the phenotype of hyperglycemia. Several distinct types of DM are caused by a complex interaction of genetics and environmental factors. Depending on the etiology of the DM, factors contributing to hyperglycemia include reduced insulin secretion, decreased glucose utilization, and increased glucose production. The metabolic dysregulation associated with DM causes secondary pathophysiologic changes in multiple organ systems that impose a tremendous burden on the individual with diabetes and on the health care system. In the United States, DM is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), nontraumatic lower extremity amputations, and adult blindness. It also predisposes to cardiovascular diseases. With an increasing incidence worldwide, DM will be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality for the foreseeable future.
 
Classification

DM is classified on the basis of the pathogenic process that leads to hyperglycemia, as opposed to earlier criteria such as age of onset or type of therapy (Fig. 344-1). The two broad categories of DM are designated type 1 and type 2 (Table 344-1). Both types of diabetes are preceded by a phase of abnormal glucose homeostasis as the pathogenic processes progress. Type 1 DM is the result of complete or near-total insulin deficiency. Type 2 DM is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by variable degrees of insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion, and increased glucose production. Distinct genetic and metabolic defects in insulin action and/or secretion give rise to the common phenotype of hyperglycemia in type 2 DM and have important potential therapeutic implications now that pharmacologic agents are available to target specific metabolic derangements. Type 2 DM is preceded by a period of abnormal glucose homeostasis classified as impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).

Figure 344-1

 
 
 
Spectrum of glucose homeostasis and diabetes mellitus (DM). The spectrum from normal glucose tolerance to diabetes in type 1 DM, type 2 DM, other specific types of diabetes, and gestational DM is shown from left to right. In most types of DM, the individual traverses from normal glucose tolerance to impaired glucose tolerance to overt diabetes (these should be viewed not as abrupt categories but as a spectrum). Arrows indicate that changes in glucose tolerance may be bidirectional in some types of diabetes. For example, individuals with type 2 DM may return to the impaired glucose tolerance category with weight loss; in gestational DM, diabetes may revert to impaired glucose tolerance or even normal glucose tolerance after delivery. The fasting plasma glucose (FPG), the 2-h plasma glucose (PG) after a glucose challenge, and the A1C for the different categories of glucose tolerance are shown at the lower part of the figure. These values do not apply to the diagnosis of gestational DM. The World Health Organization uses an FPG of 110每125 mg/dL for the prediabetes category. Some types of DM may or may not require insulin for survival. *Some use the term "increased risk for diabetes" (ADA) or "intermediate hyperglycemia" (WHO) rather than "prediabetes." (Adapted from the American Diabetes Association, 2007.)

Two features of the current classification of DM diverge from previous classifications. First, the terms insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) are obsolete. Since many individuals with type 2 DM eventually require insulin treatment for control of glycemia, the use of the term NIDDM generated considerable confusion. A second difference is that age is not a criterion in the classification system. Although type 1 DM most commonly develops before the age of 30, an autoimmune beta cell destructive process can develop at any age. It is estimated that between 5 and 10% of individuals who develop DM after age 30 years have type 1 DM. Although type 2 DM more typically develops with increasing age, it is now being diagnosed more frequently in children and young adults, particularly in obese adolescents.

Other Types of DM

Other etiologies for DM include specific genetic defects in insulin secretion or action, metabolic abnormalities that impair insulin secretion, mitochondrial abnormalities, and a host of conditions that impair glucose tolerance (Table 344-1). Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a subtype of DM characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, early onset of hyperglycemia (usually <25 years), and impairment in insulin secretion (discussed below). Mutations in the insulin receptor cause a group of rare disorders characterized by severe insulin resistance.

DM can result from pancreatic exocrine disease when the majority of pancreatic islets are destroyed. Cystic fibrosis-related DM is an important consideration in this patient population. Hormones that antagonize insulin action can also lead to DM. Thus, DM is often a feature of endocrinopathies such as acromegaly and Cushing's disease. Viral infections have been implicated in pancreatic islet destruction but are an extremely rare cause of DM. A form of acute onset of type 1 diabetes, termed fulminant diabetes, has been noted in Japan and may be related to viral infection of islets.

Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM)

Glucose intolerance developing during pregnancy is classified as gestational diabetes. Insulin resistance is related to the metabolic changes of late pregnancy, and the increased insulin requirements may lead to IGT or diabetes. GDM occurs in 7% (range 2每10%) of pregnancies in the United States; most women revert to normal glucose tolerance postpartum but have a substantial risk (35每60%) of developing DM in the next 10每20 years. The International Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups now recommends that diabetes diagnosed at the initial prenatal visit should be classified as "overt" diabetes rather than gestational diabetes.
 
Epidemiology

The worldwide prevalence of DM has risen dramatically over the past two decades, from an estimated 30 million cases in 1985 to 285 million in 2010. Based on current trends, the International Diabetes Federation projects that 438 million individuals will have diabetes by the year 2030 (Fig. 344-2). Although the prevalence of both type 1 and type 2 DM is increasing worldwide, the prevalence of type 2 DM is rising much more rapidly, presumably because of increasing obesity, reduced activity levels as countries become more industrialized, and the aging of the population. In 2010, the prevalence of diabetes ranged from 11.6 to 30.9% in the 10 countries with the highest prevalence (Naurua, United Arab Emigrates, Saudi Arabia, Mauritius, Bahrain, Reunion, Kuwait, Oman, Tonga, Malaysia〞in descending prevalence; Fig. 344-2). In the most recent estimate for the United States (2010), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that 25.8 million persons, or 8.3% of the population, had diabetes (27% of the individuals with diabetes were undiagnosed). Approximately 1.6 million individuals (>20 years) were newly diagnosed with diabetes in 2010. DM increases with aging. In 2010, the prevalence of DM in the United Sates was estimated to be 0.2% in individuals aged <20 years and 11.3% in individuals aged >20 years. In individuals aged >65 years, the prevalence of DM was 26.9%. The prevalence is similar in men and women throughout most age ranges (11.8% and 10.8%, respectively, in individuals aged >20 years). Worldwide estimates project that in 2030 the greatest number of individuals with diabetes will be aged 45每64 years.

There is considerable geographic variation in the incidence of both type 1 and type 2 DM. Scandinavia has the highest incidence of type 1 DM (e.g., in Finland, the incidence is 57.4/100,000 per year). The Pacific Rim has a much lower rate of type 1 DM (in Japan and China, the incidence is 0.6每2.4/100,000 per year); Northern Europe and the United States have an intermediate rate (8每20/100,000 per year). Much of the increased risk of type 1 DM is believed to reflect the frequency of high-risk human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles among ethnic groups in different geographic locations. The prevalence of type 2 DM and its harbinger, IGT, is highest in certain Pacific islands and the Middle East and intermediate in countries such as India and the United States. This variability is likely due to genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors. DM prevalence also varies among different ethnic populations within a given country. For example, the CDC estimated that the age-adjusted prevalence of DM in the United States (age > 20 years; 2007每2009) was 7.1% in non-Hispanic whites, 7.5% in Asian Americans, 11.8% in Hispanics, and 12.6% in non-Hispanic blacks. Comparable statistics for individuals belonging to American Indian, Alaska Native, or Pacific-Islander ethnic groups are not available, but the prevalence likely exceeds the rate in non-Hispanic whites. The onset of type 2 DM occurs, on average, at an earlier age in ethnic groups other than non-Hispanic whites. In Asia, the prevalence of diabetes is increasing rapidly and the diabetes phenotype appears to be different from that in the United States and Europe〞onset at a lower BMI and younger age, greater visceral adiposity, and reduced insulin secretory capacity.

Diabetes is a major cause of mortality, but several studies indicate that diabetes is likely underreported as a cause of death. In the United States, diabetes was listed as the seventh leading cause of death in 2007; a recent estimate suggested that diabetes was the fifth leading cause of death worldwide and was responsible for almost 4 million deaths in 2010 (6.8% of deaths were attributed to diabetes worldwide).
 
Diagnosis

Glucose tolerance is classified into three broad categories: normal glucose homeostasis, diabetes mellitus, and impaired glucose homeostasis. Glucose tolerance can be assessed using the fasting plasma glucose (FPG), the response to oral glucose challenge, or the hemoglobin A1C (A1C). An FPG <5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL), a plasma glucose <140 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) following an oral glucose challenge, and an A1C <5.6% are considered to define normal glucose tolerance. The International Expert Committee with members appointed by the American Diabetes Association, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, and the International Diabetes Federation has issued diagnostic criteria for DM (Table 344-2) based on the following premises: (1) the FPG, the response to an oral glucose challenge (OGTT〞oral glucose tolerance test), and A1C differ among individuals, and (2) DM is defined as the level of glycemia at which diabetes-specific complications occur rather than on deviations from a population-based mean. For example, the prevalence of retinopathy in Native Americans (Pima Indian population) begins to increase at an FPG >6.4 mmol/L (116 mg/dL) (Fig. 344-3).

An FPG 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL), a glucose >11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) 2 h after an oral glucose challenge, or an A1C 6.5% warrant the diagnosis of DM (Table 344-2). A random plasma glucose concentration 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) accompanied by classic symptoms of DM (polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss) also is sufficient for the diagnosis of DM (Table 344-2).

Note: In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia and acute metabolic decompensation, these criteria should be confirmed by repeat testing on a different day.

This figure shows the incidence of retinopathy in Pima Indians as a function of the fasting plasma glucose (FPG), the 2-h plasma glucose after a 75-g oral glucose challenge (2-h PG), or the A1C. Note that the incidence of retinopathy greatly increases at a fasting plasma glucose >116 mg/dL, or a 2-h plasma glucose of 185 mg/dL, or an A1C > 6.5%. (Blood glucose values are shown in mg/dL; to convert to mmol/L, divide value by 18.) (Copyright 2002, American Diabetes Association. From Diabetes Care 25(Suppl 1): S5每S20, 2002.)
 
 

Abnormal glucose homeostasis (Fig. 344-1) is defined as (1) FPG = 5.6每6.9 mmol/L (100每125 mg/dL), which is defined as IFG (note that the World Health Organization uses an FPG of 6.1每6.9 mmol/L (110每125 mg/dL); (2) plasma glucose levels between 7.8 and 11 mmol/L (140 and 199 mg/dL) following an oral glucose challenge, which is termed impaired glucose tolerance (IGT); or (3) A1C of 5.7每6.4%. An A1C of 5.7每6.4%, IFG, and IGT do not identify the same individuals, but individuals in all three groups are at greater risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes and have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Some use the term "prediabetes," "increased risk of diabetes" (ADA), or "intermediate hyperglycemia" (WHO) for this category. The current criteria for the diagnosis of DM emphasize that the A1C or the FPG as the most reliable and convenient tests for identifying DM in asymptomatic individuals. Oral glucose tolerance testing, although still a valid means for diagnosing DM, is not often used in routine clinical care.

The diagnosis of DM has profound implications for an individual from both a medical and a financial standpoint. Thus, abnormalities on screening tests for diabetes should be repeated before making a definitive diagnosis of DM, unless acute metabolic derangements or a markedly elevated plasma glucose are present (Table 344-2). These criteria also allow for the diagnosis of DM to be withdrawn in situations when the glucose intolerance reverts to normal.

Screening

Widespread use of the FPG or the A1C as a screening test for type 2 DM is recommended because (1) a large number of individuals who meet the current criteria for DM are asymptomatic and unaware that they have the disorder, (2) epidemiologic studies suggest that type 2 DM may be present for up to a decade before diagnosis, (3) some individuals with type 2 DM have one or more diabetes-specific complications at the time of their diagnosis, and (4) treatment of type 2 DM may favorably alter the natural history of DM. The ADA recommends screening all individuals >45 years every 3 years and screening individuals at an earlier age if they are overweight [body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m2] and have one additional risk factor for diabetes (Table 344-3). In contrast to type 2 DM, a long asymptomatic period of hyperglycemia is rare prior to the diagnosis of type 1 DM. A number of immunologic markers for type 1 DM are becoming available (discussed below), but their routine use is discouraged pending the identification of clinically beneficial interventions for individuals at high risk for developing type 1 DM.

Insulin Biosynthesis, Secretion, and Action

Biosynthesis

Insulin is produced in the beta cells of the pancreatic islets. It is initially synthesized as a single-chain 86-amino-acid precursor polypeptide, preproinsulin. Subsequent proteolytic processing removes the amino-terminal signal peptide, giving rise to proinsulin. Proinsulin is structurally related to insulin-like growth factors I and II, which bind weakly to the insulin receptor. Cleavage of an internal 31-residue fragment from proinsulin generates the C peptide and the A (21 amino acids) and B (30 amino acids) chains of insulin, which are connected by disulfide bonds. The mature insulin molecule and C peptide are stored together and co-secreted from secretory granules in the beta cells. Because C peptide is cleared more slowly than insulin, it is a useful marker of insulin secretion and allows discrimination of endogenous and exogenous sources of insulin in the evaluation of hypoglycemia (Chaps. 345 and 350). Pancreatic beta cells co-secrete islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) or amylin, a 37-amino-acid peptide, along with insulin. The role of IAPP in normal physiology is incompletely defined, but it is the major component of the amyloid fibrils found in the islets of patients with type 2 diabetes, and an analogue is sometimes used in treating type 1 and type 2 DM. Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology; structural alterations at one or more amino acid residues modify its physical and pharmacologic characteristics (see below).

Secretion

Glucose is the key regulator of insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta cell, although amino acids, ketones, various nutrients, gastrointestinal peptides, and neurotransmitters also influence insulin secretion. Glucose levels >3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) stimulate insulin synthesis, primarily by enhancing protein translation and processing. Glucose stimulation of insulin secretion begins with its transport into the beta cell by a facilitative glucose transporter (Fig. 344-4). Glucose phosphorylation by glucokinase is the rate-limiting step that controls glucose-regulated insulin secretion. Further metabolism of glucose-6-phosphate via glycolysis generates ATP, which inhibits the activity of an ATP-sensitive K+ channel. This channel consists of two separate proteins: one is the binding site for certain oral hypoglycemics (e.g., sulfonyl-ureas, meglitinides); the other is an inwardly rectifying K+ channel protein (Kir6.2). Inhibition of this K+ channel induces beta cell membrane depolarization, which opens voltage-dependent calcium channels (leading to an influx of calcium), and stimulates insulin secretion. Insulin secretory profiles reveal a pulsatile pattern of hormone release, with small secretory bursts occurring about every 10 min, superimposed upon greater amplitude oscillations of about 80每150 min. Incretins are released from neuroendocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract following food ingestion and amplify glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and suppress glucagon secretion. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), the most potent incretin, is released from L cells in the small intestine and stimulates insulin secretion only when the blood glucose is above the fasting level. Incretin analogues, are used to enhance endogenous insulin secretion (see below).

Figure 344-4

 
 
 
Mechanisms of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and abnormalities in diabetes. Glucose and other nutrients regulate insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta cell. Glucose is transported by a glucose transporter (GLUT1 in humans, GLUT2 in rodents); subsequent glucose metabolism by the beta cell alters ion channel activity, leading to insulin secretion. The SUR receptor is the binding site for some drugs that act as insulin secretagogues. Mutations in the events or proteins underlined are a cause of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) or other forms of diabetes. SUR, sulfonylurea receptor; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; ADP, adenosine diphosphate, cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate. IAPP, islet amyloid polypeptide or amylin.
 
 

Action

Once insulin is secreted into the portal venous system, 50% is removed and degraded by the liver. Unextracted insulin enters the systemic circulation where it binds to receptors in target sites. Insulin binding to its receptor stimulates intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, leading to receptor autophosphorylation and the recruitment of intracellular signaling molecules, such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) (Fig. 344-5). IRS and other adaptor proteins initiate a complex cascade of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions, resulting in the widespread metabolic and mitogenic effects of insulin. As an example, activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3∩-kinase (PI-3-kinase) pathway stimulates translocation of a facilitative glucose transporter (e.g., GLUT4) to the cell surface, an event that is crucial for glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and fat. Activation of other insulin receptor signaling pathways induces glycogen synthesis, protein synthesis, lipogenesis, and regulation of various genes in insulin-responsive cells.

Figure 344-5

 
 
 
Insulin signal transduction pathway in skeletal muscle. The insulin receptor has intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and interacts with insulin receptor substrates (IRS and Shc) proteins. A number of "docking" proteins bind to these cellular proteins and initiate the metabolic actions of insulin [GrB-2, SOS, SHP-2, p110, and phosphatidylinositol-3∩-kinase (PI-3-kinase)]. Insulin increases glucose transport through PI-3-kinase and the Cbl pathway, which promotes the translocation of intracellular vesicles containing GLUT4 glucose transporter to the plasma membrane.
 
 

Glucose homeostasis reflects a balance between hepatic glucose production and peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Insulin is the most important regulator of this metabolic equilibrium, but neural input, metabolic signals, and other hormones (e.g., glucagon) result in integrated control of glucose supply and utilization (Chap. 345; see Fig. 345-1). In the fasting state, low insulin levels increase glucose production by promoting hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis and reduce glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissues (skeletal muscle and fat), thereby promoting mobilization of stored precursors such as amino acids and free fatty acids (lipolysis). Glucagon, secreted by pancreatic alpha cells when blood glucose or insulin levels are low, stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis by the liver and renal medulla. Postprandially, the glucose load elicits a rise in insulin and fall in glucagon, leading to a reversal of these processes. Insulin, an anabolic hormone, promotes the storage of carbohydrate and fat and protein synthesis. The major portion of postprandial glucose is utilized by skeletal muscle, an effect of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Other tissues, most notably the brain, utilize glucose in an insulin-independent fashion.
 
Pathogenesis

Type 1 DM

Type 1 DM is the result of interactions of genetic, environmental, and immunologic factors that ultimately lead to the destruction of the pancreatic beta cells and insulin deficiency. Type 1 DM results from autoimmune beta cell destruction, and most, but not all, individuals have evidence of islet-directed autoimmunity. Some individuals who have the clinical phenotype of type 1 DM lack immunologic markers indicative of an autoimmune process involving the beta cells and the genetic markers of type 1 diabetes. These individuals are thought to develop insulin deficiency by unknown, nonimmune mechanisms and are ketosis prone; many are African American or Asian in heritage. The temporal development of type 1 DM is shown schematically as a function of beta cell mass in Fig. 344-6. Individuals with a genetic susceptibility have normal beta cell mass at birth but begin to lose beta cells secondary to autoimmune destruction that occurs over months to years. This autoimmune process is thought to be triggered by an infectious or environmental stimulus and to be sustained by a beta cell每specific molecule. In the majority, immunologic markers appear after the triggering event but before diabetes becomes clinically overt. Beta cell mass then begins to decrease, and insulin secretion progressively declines, although normal glucose tolerance is maintained. The rate of decline in beta cell mass varies widely among individuals, with some patients progressing rapidly to clinical diabetes and others evolving more slowly. Features of diabetes do not become evident until a majority of beta cells are destroyed (70每80%). At this point, residual functional beta cells exist but are insufficient in number to maintain glucose tolerance. The events that trigger the transition from glucose intolerance to frank diabetes are often associated with increased insulin requirements, as might occur during infections or puberty. After the initial clinical presentation of type 1 DM, a "honeymoon" phase may ensue during which time glycemic control is achieved with modest doses of insulin or, rarely, insulin is not needed. However, this fleeting phase of endogenous insulin production from residual beta cells disappears as the autoimmune process destroys remaining beta cells, and the individual becomes insulin deficient. Some individuals with long-standing type 1 diabetes produce a small amount of insulin (as reflected by C-peptide production) and some individuals have insulin-positive cells in the pancreas at autopsy.

Temporal model for development of type 1 diabetes. Individuals with a genetic predisposition are exposed to an immunologic trigger that initiates an autoimmune process, resulting in a gradual decline in beta cell mass. The downward slope of the beta cell mass varies among individuals and may not be continuous. This progressive impairment in insulin release results in diabetes when 80% of the beta cell mass is destroyed. A "honeymoon" phase may be seen in the first 1 or 2 years after the onset of diabetes and is associated with reduced insulin requirements.

Genetic Considerations

Susceptibility to type 1 DM involves multiple genes. The concordance of type 1 DM in identical twins ranges between 40 and 60%, indicating that additional modifying factors are likely involved in determining whether diabetes develops. The major susceptibility gene for type 1 DM is located in the HLA region on chromosome 6. Polymorphisms in the HLA complex account for 40每50% of the genetic risk of developing type 1 DM. This region contains genes that encode the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, which present antigen to helper T cells and thus are involved in initiating the immune response (Chap. 315). The ability of class II MHC molecules to present antigen is dependent on the amino acid composition of their antigen-binding sites. Amino acid substitutions may influence the specificity of the immune response by altering the binding affinity of different antigens for class II molecules.

Most individuals with type 1 DM have the HLA DR3 and/or DR4 haplotype. Refinements in genotyping of HLA loci have shown that the haplotypes DQA1*0301, DQB1*0302, and DQB1*0201 are most strongly associated with type 1 DM. These haplotypes are present in 40% of children with type 1 DM as compared to 2% of the normal U.S. population. However, most individuals with predisposing haplotypes do not develop diabetes.

In addition to MHC class II associations, genome association studies have identified at least 20 different genetic loci that contribute susceptibility to type 1 DM (polymorphisms in the promoter region of the insulin gene, the CTLA-4 gene, interleukin-2 receptor, CTLA4, and PTPN22, etc.). Genes that confer protection against the development of the disease also exist. The haplotype DQA1*0102, DQB1*0602 is extremely rare in individuals with type 1 DM (<1%) and appears to provide protection from type 1 DM.

Although the risk of developing type 1 DM is increased tenfold in relatives of individuals with the disease, the risk is relatively low: 3每4% if the parent has type 1 diabetes and 5每15% in a sibling (depending on which HLA haplotypes are shared). Hence, most individuals with type 1 DM do not have a first-degree relative with this disorder.

Pathophysiology

Although other islet cell types [alpha cells (glucagon-producing), delta cells (somatostatin-producing), or PP cells (pancreatic polypeptide-producing)] are functionally and embryologically similar to beta cells and express most of the same proteins as beta cells, they are spared from the autoimmune destruction. Pathologically, the pancreatic islets are infiltrated with lymphocytes (a process termed insulitis). After all beta cells are destroyed, the inflammatory process abates, the islets become atrophic, and most immunologic markers disappear. Studies of the autoimmune process in humans and in animal models of type 1 DM (NOD mouse and BB rat) have identified the following abnormalities in the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system: (1) islet cell autoantibodies; (2) activated lymphocytes in the islets, peripancreatic lymph nodes, and systemic circulation; (3) T lymphocytes that proliferate when stimulated with islet proteins; and (4) release of cytokines within the insulitis. Beta cells seem to be particularly susceptible to the toxic effect of some cytokines [tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-), interferon , and interleukin 1 (IL-1)]. The precise mechanisms of beta cell death are not known but may involve formation of nitric oxide metabolites, apoptosis, and direct CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity. The islet destruction is mediated by T lymphocytes rather than islet autoantibodies, as these antibodies do not generally react with the cell surface of islet cells and are not capable of transferring DM to animals. Suppression of the autoimmune process at the time of diagnosis of diabetes slows the decline in beta cell destruction, but the safety of such interventions is unknown.

Pancreatic islet molecules targeted by the autoimmune process include insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD, the biosynthetic enzyme for the neurotransmitter GABA), ICA-512/IA-2 (homology with tyrosine phosphatases), and a beta cell每specific zinc transporter (ZnT-8). Most of the autoantigens are not beta cell每specific, which raises the question of how the beta cells are selectively destroyed. Current theories favor initiation of an autoimmune process directed at one beta cell molecule, which then spreads to other islet molecules as the immune process destroys beta cells and creates a series of secondary autoantigens. The beta cells of individuals who develop type 1 DM do not differ from beta cells of normal individuals, since islets transplanted from a genetically identical twin are destroyed by a recurrence of the autoimmune process of type 1 DM.

Immunologic Markers

Islet cell autoantibodies (ICAs) are a composite of several different antibodies directed at pancreatic islet molecules such as GAD, insulin, IA-2/ICA-512, and ZnT-8, and serve as a marker of the autoimmune process of type 1 DM. Assays for autoantibodies to GAD-65 are commercially available. Testing for ICAs can be useful in classifying the type of DM as type 1 and in identifying nondiabetic individuals at risk for developing type 1 DM. ICAs are present in the majority of individuals (>85%) diagnosed with new-onset type 1 DM, in a significant minority of individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 DM (5每10%), and occasionally in individuals with GDM (<5%). ICAs are present in 3每4% of first-degree relatives of individuals with type 1 DM. In combination with impaired insulin secretion after IV glucose tolerance testing, they predict a >50% risk of developing type 1 DM within 5 years. At present, the measurement of ICAs in nondiabetic individuals is a research tool because no treatments have been approved to prevent the occurrence or progression to type 1 DM. Clinical trials are testing interventions to slow the autoimmune beta cell destruction.

Environmental Factors

Numerous environmental events have been proposed to trigger the autoimmune process in genetically susceptible individuals; however, none have been conclusively linked to diabetes. Identification of an environmental trigger has been difficult because the event may precede the onset of DM by several years (Fig. 344-6). Putative environmental triggers include viruses (coxsackie, rubella, enteroviruses most prominently), bovine milk proteins, and nitrosourea compounds.

Prevention of Type 1 DM

A number of interventions have successfully delayed or prevented diabetes in animal models. Some interventions have targeted the immune system directly (immunosuppression, selective T cell subset deletion, induction of immunologic tolerance to islet proteins), whereas others have prevented islet cell death by blocking cytotoxic cytokines or increasing islet resistance to the destructive process. Though results in animal models are promising, these interventions have not been successful in preventing type 1 DM in humans. The Diabetes Prevention Trial〞type 1 concluded that administering insulin (IV or PO) to individuals at high risk for developing type 1 DM did not prevent type 1 DM.

In patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes, treatment with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies, a GADvaccine, and anti-B lymphocyte monoclonal antibody have been shown to slow the decline in C-peptide levels. This is an area of active clinical investigation.

Type 2 DM

Insulin resistance and abnormal insulin secretion are central to the development of type 2 DM. Although the primary defect is controversial, most studies support the view that insulin resistance precedes an insulin secretory defect but that diabetes develops only when insulin secretion becomes inadequate. Type 2 DM likely encompasses a range of disorders with common phenotype of hyperglycemia. Most of our current understanding (and the discussion below) of the pathophysiology and genetics is based on studies of individuals of European descent. It is becoming increasing apparent that DM in other ethnic groups (Asian, African, and Latin American) has a different, but yet undefined, pathophysiology. In these groups, DM that is ketosisprone (often obese) or ketosis-resistant (often lean) is commonly seen.

Genetic Considerations

Type 2 DM has a strong genetic component. The concordance of type 2 DM in identical twins is between 70 and 90%. Individuals with a parent with type 2 DM have an increased risk of diabetes; if both parents have type 2 DM, the risk approaches 40%. Insulin resistance, as demonstrated by reduced glucose utilization in skeletal muscle, is present in many nondiabetic, first-degree relatives of individuals with type 2 DM. The disease is polygenic and multifactorial, since in addition to genetic susceptibility, environmental factors (such as obesity, nutrition, and physical activity) modulate the phenotype. The genes that predispose to type 2 DM are incompletely identified, but recent genome-wide association studies have identified a large number of genes that convey a relatively small risk for type 2 DM (>20 genes, each with a relative risk of 1.06每1.5). Most prominent is a variant of the transcription factor 7每like 2 gene that has been associated with type 2 diabetes in several populations and with impaired glucose tolerance in one population at high risk for diabetes. Genetic polymorphisms associated with type 2 diabetes have also been found in the genes encoding the peroxisome proliferators每activated receptor-, inward rectifying potassium channel, zinc transporter, IRS, and calpain 10. The mechanisms by which these genetic loci increase the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes are not clear, but most are predicted to alter islet function or development or insulin secretion. While the genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes is under active investigation (estimation that <10% of genetic risk is determined by loci identified thus far), it is currently not possible to use a combination of known genetic loci to predict type 2 diabetes.

Pathophysiology

Type 2 DM is characterized by impaired insulin secretion, insulin resistance, excessive hepatic glucose production, and abnormal fat metabolism. Obesity, particularly visceral or central (as evidenced by the hip-waist ratio), is very common in type 2 DM (80% or more are obese). In the early stages of the disorder, glucose tolerance remains near-normal, despite insulin resistance, because the pancreatic beta cells compensate by increasing insulin output (Fig. 344-7). As insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia progress, the pancreatic islets in certain individuals are unable to sustain the hyperinsulinemic state. IGT, characterized by elevations in postprandial glucose, then develops. A further decline in insulin secretion and an increase in hepatic glucose production lead to overt diabetes with fasting hyperglycemia. Ultimately, beta cell failure ensues.

Figure 344-7

 
 
 
Metabolic changes during the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity are related, and as an individual becomes more insulin resistant (by moving from point A to point B), insulin secretion increases. A failure to compensate by increasing the insulin secretion results initially in impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; point C) and ultimately in type 2 DM (point D).

Metabolic Abnormalities

Abnormal Muscle and Fat Metabolism

Insulin resistance, the decreased ability of insulin to act effectively on target tissues (especially muscle, liver, and fat), is a prominent feature of type 2 DM and results from a combination of genetic susceptibility and obesity. Insulin resistance is relative, however, since supranormal levels of circulating insulin will normalize the plasma glucose. Insulin dose-response curves exhibit a rightward shift, indicating reduced sensitivity, and a reduced maximal response, indicating an overall decrease in maximum glucose utilization (30每60% lower than in normal individuals). Insulin resistance impairs glucose utilization by insulin-sensitive tissues and increases hepatic glucose output; both effects contribute to the hyperglycemia. Increased hepatic glucose output predominantly accounts for increased FPG levels, whereas decreased peripheral glucose usage results in postprandial hyperglycemia. In skeletal muscle, there is a greater impairment in nonoxidative glucose usage (glycogen formation) than in oxidative glucose metabolism through glycolysis. Glucose metabolism in insulin-independent tissues is not altered in type 2 DM.

The precise molecular mechanism leading to insulin resistance in type 2 DM has not been elucidated. Insulin receptor levels and tyrosine kinase activity in skeletal muscle are reduced, but these alterations are most likely secondary to hyperinsulinemia and are not a primary defect. Therefore, "postreceptor" defects in insulin-regulated phosphorylation/dephosphorylation appear to play the predominant role in insulin resistance (Fig. 344-5). For example, a PI-3-kinase signaling defect might reduce translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. Other abnormalities include the accumulation of lipid within skeletal myocytes, which may impair mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and reduce insulin-stimulated mitochondrial ATP production. Impaired fatty acid oxidation and lipid accumulation within skeletal myocytes also may generate reactive oxygen species such as lipid peroxides. Of note, not all insulin signal transduction pathways are resistant to the effects of insulin (e.g., those controlling cell growth and differentiation using the mitogenic-activated protein kinase pathway). Consequently, hyperinsulinemia may increase the insulin action through these pathways, potentially accelerating diabetes-related conditions such as atherosclerosis.

The obesity accompanying type 2 DM, particularly in a central or visceral location, is thought to be part of the pathogenic process. The increased adipocyte mass leads to increased levels of circulating free fatty acids and other fat cell products (Chap. 77). For example, adipocytes secrete a number of biologic products (nonesterified free fatty acids, retinol-binding protein 4, leptin, TNF-, resistin, and adiponectin). In addition to regulating body weight, appetite, and energy expenditure, adipokines also modulate insulin sensitivity. The increased production of free fatty acids and some adipokines may cause insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and liver. For example, free fatty acids impair glucose utilization in skeletal muscle, promote glucose production by the liver, and impair beta cell function. In contrast, the production by adipocytes of adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing peptide, is reduced in obesity, and this may contribute to hepatic insulin resistance. Adipocyte products and adipokines also produce an inflammatory state and may explain why markers of inflammation such as IL-6 and C-reactive protein are often elevated in type 2 DM. In addition, inflammatory cells have been found infiltrating adipose tissue. Inhibition of inflammatory signaling pathways such as the nuclear factor B (NF-B) pathway appears to reduce insulin resistance and improve hyper-glycemia in animal models.

Impaired Insulin Secretion

Insulin secretion and sensitivity are interrelated (Fig. 344-7). In type 2 DM, insulin secretion initially increases in response to insulin resistance to maintain normal glucose tolerance. Initially, the insulin secretory defect is mild and selectively involves glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The response to other nonglucose secretagogues, such as arginine, is preserved. Abnormalities in proinsulin processing is reflected by increased secretion of proinsulin in type 2 diabetes. Eventually, the insulin secretory defect progresses to a state of inadequate insulin secretion.

The reason(s) for the decline in insulin secretory capacity in type 2 DM is unclear. The assumption is that a second genetic defect〞superimposed upon insulin resistance〞leads to beta cell failure. Beta cell mass is decreased by approximately 50% in individuals with long-standing type 2 diabetes. Islet amyloid polypeptide or amylin is co-secreted by the beta cell and forms the amyloid fibrillar deposit found in the islets of individuals with long-standing type 2 DM. Whether such islet amyloid deposits are a primary or secondary event is not known. The metabolic environment of diabetes may also negatively impact islet function. For example, chronic hyperglycemia paradoxically impairs islet function ("glucose toxicity") and leads to a worsening of hyperglycemia. Improvement in glycemic control is often associated with improved islet function. In addition, elevation of free fatty acid levels ("lipotoxicity") and dietary fat may also worsen islet function.

Increased Hepatic Glucose and Lipid Production

In type 2 DM, insulin resistance in the liver reflects the failure of hyperinsulinemia to suppress gluconeogenesis, which results in fasting hyperglycemia and decreased glycogen storage by the liver in the postprandial state. Increased hepatic glucose production occurs early in the course of diabetes, though likely after the onset of insulin secretory abnormalities and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. As a result of insulin resistance in adipose tissue, lipolysis and free fatty acid flux from adipocytes are increased, leading to increased lipid [very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and triglyceride] synthesis in hepatocytes. This lipid storage or steatosis in the liver may lead to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (Chap. 309) and abnormal liver function tests. This is also responsible for the dyslipidemia found in type 2 DM [elevated triglycerides, reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and increased small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles].

Insulin Resistance Syndromes

The insulin resistance condition comprises a spectrum of disorders, with hyperglycemia representing one of the most readily diagnosed features. The metabolic syndrome, the insulin resistance syndrome, or syndrome X are terms used to describe a constellation of metabolic derangements that includes insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia (decreased HDL and elevated triglycerides), central or visceral obesity, type 2 diabetes or IGT/IFG, and accelerated cardiovascular disease. This syndrome is discussed in Chap. 242.

A number of relatively rare forms of severe insulin resistance include features of type 2 DM or IGT (Table 344-1). Mutations in the insulin receptor that interfere with binding or signal transduction are a rare cause of insulin resistance. Acanthosis nigricans and signs of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, acne, and oligomenorrhea in women) are also common physical features. Two distinct syndromes of severe insulin resistance have been described in adults: (1) type A, which affects young women and is characterized by severe hyperinsulinemia, obesity, and features of hyperandrogenism; and (2) type B, which affects middle-aged women and is characterized by severe hyperinsulinemia, features of hyperandrogenism, and autoimmune disorders. Individuals with the type A insulin resistance syndrome have an undefined defect in the insulin-signaling pathway; individuals with the type B insulin resistance syndrome have autoantibodies directed at the insulin receptor. These receptor autoantibodies may block insulin binding or may stimulate the insulin receptor, leading to intermittent hypoglycemia.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disorder that affects premenopausal women and is characterized by chronic anovulation and hyperandrogenism (Chap. 347). Insulin resistance is seen in a significant subset of women with PCOS, and the disorder substantially increases the risk for type 2 DM, independent of the effects of obesity.

Prevention

Type 2 DM is preceded by a period of IGT or IFG, and a number of lifestyle modifications and pharmacologic agents prevent or delay the onset of DM. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) demonstrated that intensive changes in lifestyle (diet and exercise for 30 min/d five times/week) in individuals with IGT prevented or delayed the development of type 2 DM by 58% compared to placebo. This effect was seen in individuals regardless of age, sex, or ethnic group. In the same study, metformin prevented or delayed diabetes by 31% compared to placebo. The lifestyle intervention group lost 5每7% of their body weight during the 3 years of the study. Studies in Finnish and Chinese populations noted similar efficacy of diet and exercise in preventing or delaying type 2 DM; -glucosidase inhibitors, metformin, thiazolidinediones, and orlistat prevent or delay type 2 DM but are not approved for this purpose. Individuals with a strong family history of type 2 DM and individuals with IFG or IGT should be strongly encouraged to maintain a normal BMI and engage in regular physical activity. Pharmacologic therapy for individuals with prediabetes is currently controversial because its cost-effectiveness and safety profile are not known. The ADA has suggested that metformin be considered in individuals with both IFG and IGT who are at very high risk for progression to diabetes (age <60 years, BMI 35 kg/m2, family history of diabetes in first-degree relative, elevated triglycerides, reduced HDL, hypertension, or A1C >6.0%). Individuals with IFG, IGT, or an A1C of 5.7每6.4% should be monitored annually to determine if diagnostic criteria for diabetes are present.
 
Genetically Defined, Monogenic

Forms of Diabetes Mellitus

Several monogenic forms of DM have been identified. Six different variants of MODY, caused by mutations in genes encoding islet-enriched transcription factors or glucokinase (Fig. 344-4; Table 344-1), are transmitted as autosomal dominant disorders. MODY 1, MODY 3, and MODY 5 are caused by mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear transcription factor (HNF) 4, HNF-1, and HNF-1, respectively. As their names imply, these transcription factors are expressed in the liver but also in other tissues, including the pancreatic islets and kidney. These factors most likely affect islet development or the expression of genes important in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion or the maintenance of beta cell mass. For example, individuals with an HNF-1 mutation (MODY 3) have a progressive decline in glycemic control but may respond to sulfonylureas. In fact, some of these patients were initially thought to have type 1 DM but were later shown to respond to a sulfonylurea, and insulin was discontinued. Individuals with a HNF-1 mutation have progressive impairment of insulin secretion, hepatic insulin resistance, and require insulin treatment (minimal response to sulfonylureas). These individuals often have other abnormalities such as renal cysts, mild pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, and abnormal liver function tests. Individuals with MODY 2, the result of mutations in the glucokinase gene, have mild-to-moderate, stable hyperglycemia that does not respond to oral hypoglycemic agents. Glucokinase catalyzes the formation of glucose-6-phosphate from glucose, a reaction that is important for glucose sensing by the beta cells and for glucose utilization by the liver. As a result of glucokinase mutations, higher glucose levels are required to elicit insulin secretory responses, thus altering the set point for insulin secretion. MODY 4 is a rare variant caused by mutations in the insulin promoter factor (IPF) 1, which is a transcription factor that regulates pancreatic development and insulin gene transcription. Homozygous inactivating mutations cause pancreatic agenesis, whereas heterozygous mutations may result in DM. Studies of populations with type 2 DM suggest that mutations in MODY-associated genes are an uncommon (<5%) cause of type 2 DM.

Transient or permanent neonatal diabetes (onset <6 months of age) occurs. Permanent neonatal diabetes may be caused by several genetic mutations and usually requires treatment with insulin. Mutations in the ATP-sensitive potassium channel subunits (Kir6.2 and ABCC8) and the insulin gene (interfere with proinsulin folding and processing) (Fig. 344-4) are the major causes of permanent neonatal diabetes. Although these activating mutations in the ATP-sensitive potassium channel subunits impair glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, these individuals may respond to sulfonylureas and be treated with these agents. These mutations are associated with a spectrum of neurologic dysfunction. Homozygous glucokinase mutations cause a severe form of neonatal diabetes.
 
Acute Complications of DM

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) are acute complications of diabetes. DKA was formerly considered a hallmark of type 1 DM, but also occurs in individuals who lack immunologic features of type 1 DM and who can sometimes subsequently be treated with oral glucose-lowering agents (these obese individuals with type 2 DM are often of Hispanic or African-American descent. The initial management of DKA is similar. HHS is primarily seen in individuals with type 2 DM. Both disorders are associated with absolute or relative insulin deficiency, volume depletion, and acid-base abnormalities. DKA and HHS exist along a continuum of hyperglycemia, with or without ketosis. The metabolic similarities and differences in DKA and HHS are highlighted in Table 344-4. Both disorders are associated with potentially serious complications if not promptly diagnosed and treated.

Clinical Features

The symptoms and physical signs of DKA are listed in Table 344-5 and usually develop over 24 h. DKA may be the initial symptom complex that leads to a diagnosis of type 1 DM, but more frequently it occurs in individuals with established diabetes. Nausea and vomiting are often prominent, and their presence in an individual with diabetes warrants laboratory evaluation for DKA. Abdominal pain may be severe and can resemble acute pancreatitis or ruptured viscus. Hyperglycemia leads to glucosuria, volume depletion, and tachycardia. Hypotension can occur because of volume depletion in combination with peripheral vasodilatation. Kussmaul respirations and a fruity odor on the patient's breath (secondary to metabolic acidosis and increased acetone) are classic signs of the disorder. Lethargy and central nervous system depression may evolve into coma with severe DKA but should also prompt evaluation for other reasons for altered mental status (infection, hypoxemia, etc.). Cerebral edema, an extremely serious complication of DKA, is seen most frequently in children. Signs of infection, which may precipitate DKA, should be sought on physical examination, even in the absence of fever. Tissue ischemia (heart, brain) can also be a precipitating factor. Omission of insulin because of an eating disorder may sometimes precipitate DKA.

Pathophysiology

DKA results from relative or absolute insulin deficiency combined with counterregulatory hormone excess (glucagon, catecholamines, cortisol, and growth hormone). Both insulin deficiency and glucagon excess, in particular, are necessary for DKA to develop. The decreased ratio of insulin to glucagon promotes gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and ketone body formation in the liver, as well as increases in substrate delivery from fat and muscle (free fatty acids, amino acids) to the liver. Markers of inflammation (cytokines, C-reactive protein) are elevated in both DKA and HHS

The combination of insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia reduces the hepatic level of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, which alters the activity of phosphofructokinase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Glucagon excess decreases the activity of pyruvate kinase, whereas insulin deficiency increases the activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. These changes shift the handling of pyruvate toward glucose synthesis and away from glycolysis. The increased levels of glucagon and catecholamines in the face of low insulin levels promote glycogenolysis. Insulin deficiency also reduces levels of the GLUT4 glucose transporter, which impairs glucose uptake into skeletal muscle and fat and reduces intracellular glucose metabolism (Fig. 344-5).

Ketosis results from a marked increase in free fatty acid release from adipocytes, with a resulting shift toward ketone body synthesis in the liver. Reduced insulin levels, in combination with elevations in catecholamines and growth hormone, increase lipolysis and the release of free fatty acids. Normally, these free fatty acids are converted to triglycerides or VLDL in the liver. However, in DKA, hyperglucagonemia alters hepatic metabolism to favor ketone body formation, through activation of the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase I. This enzyme is crucial for regulating fatty acid transport into the mitochondria, where beta oxidation and conversion to ketone bodies occur. At physiologic pH, ketone bodies exist as ketoacids, which are neutralized by bicarbonate. As bicarbonate stores are depleted, metabolic acidosis ensues. Increased lactic acid production also contributes to the acidosis. The increased free fatty acids increase triglyceride and VLDL production. VLDL clearance is also reduced because the activity of insulin-sensitive lipoprotein lipase in muscle and fat is decreased. Hypertriglyceridemia may be severe enough to cause pancreatitis.

DKA is often precipitated by increased insulin requirements, as occurs during a concurrent illness (Table 344-5). Failure to augment insulin therapy often compounds the problem. Complete omission or inadequate administration of insulin by the patient or health care team (in a hospitalized patient with type 1 DM) may precipitate DKA. Patients using insulin infusion devices with short-acting insulin may develop DKA, since even a brief interruption in insulin delivery (e.g., mechanical malfunction) quickly leads to insulin deficiency.

Laboratory Abnormalities and Diagnosis

The timely diagnosis of DKA is crucial and allows for prompt initiation of therapy. DKA is characterized by hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis (increased anion gap) along with a number of secondary metabolic derangements (Table 344-4). Occasionally, the serum glucose is only minimally elevated. Serum bicarbonate is frequently <10 mmol/L, and arterial pH ranges between 6.8 and 7.3, depending on the severity of the acidosis. Despite a total-body potassium deficit, the serum potassium at presentation may be mildly elevated, secondary to the acidosis. Total-body stores of sodium, chloride, phosphorus, and magnesium are reduced in DKA but are not accurately reflected by their levels in the serum because of dehydration and hyperglycemia. Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine levels reflect intravascular volume depletion. Interference from acetoacetate may falsely elevate the serum creatinine measurement. Leukocytosis, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperlipoproteinemia are commonly found as well. Hyperamylasemia may suggest a diagnosis of pancreatitis, especially when accompanied by abdominal pain. However, in DKA the amylase is usually of salivary origin and thus is not diagnostic of pancreatitis. Serum lipase should be obtained if pancreatitis is suspected.

The measured serum sodium is reduced as a consequence of the hyperglycemia [1.6-mmol/L (1.6 meq) reduction in serum sodium for each 5.6-mmol/L (100 mg/dL) rise in the serum glucose]. A normal serum sodium in the setting of DKA indicates a more profound water deficit. In "conventional" units, the calculated serum osmolality [2 x (serum sodium + serum potassium) + plasma glucose (mg/dL)/18 + BUN/2.8] is mildly to moderately elevated, though to a lesser degree than that found in HHS (see below).

In DKA, the ketone body, -hydroxybutyrate, is synthesized at a threefold greater rate than acetoacetate; however, acetoacetate is preferentially detected by a commonly used ketosis detection reagent (nitroprusside). Serum ketones are present at significant levels (usually positive at serum dilution of 1:8). The nitroprusside tablet, or stick, is often used to detect urine ketones; certain medications such as captopril or penicillamine may cause false-positive reactions. Serum or plasma assays for -hydroxybutyrate are preferred since they more accurately reflect the true ketone body level.

The metabolic derangements of DKA exist along a spectrum, beginning with mild acidosis with moderate hyperglycemia evolving into more severe findings. The degree of acidosis and hyperglycemia do not necessarily correlate closely since a variety of factors determine the level of hyperglycemia (oral intake, urinary glucose loss). Ketonemia is a consistent finding in DKA and distinguishes it from simple hyperglycemia. The differential diagnosis of DKA includes starvation ketosis, alcoholic ketoacidosis (bicarbonate usually >15 meq/L) and other forms of increased anion-gap acidosis (Chap. 47).

Treatment: Diabetic Ketoacidosis

The management of DKA is outlined in Table 344-6. After initiating IV fluid replacement and insulin therapy, the agent or event that precipitated the episode of DKA should be sought and aggressively treated. If the patient is vomiting or has altered mental status, a nasogastric tube should be inserted to prevent aspiration of gastric contents. Central to successful treatment of DKA is careful monitoring and frequent reassessment to ensure that the patient and the metabolic derangements are improving. A comprehensive flow sheet should record chronologic changes in vital signs, fluid intake and output, and laboratory values as a function of insulin administered.

Table 344-6 Management of Diabetic Ketoacidosis

 
 
1. Confirm diagnosis (plasma glucose, positive serum ketones, metabolic acidosis). 
2. Admit to hospital; intensive-care setting may be necessary for frequent monitoring or if pH <7.00 or unconscious. 
3. Assess:

    Serum electrolytes (K+, Na+, Mg2+, Cl每, bicarbonate, phosphate)

    Acid-base status〞pH, HCO3每, PCO2, -hydroxybutyrate

    Renal function (creatinine, urine output)
 
4. Replace fluids: 2每3 L of 0.9% saline over first 1每3 h ? (15每20 mL/kg per hour); subsequently, 0.45% saline at 250每500 mL/h; change to 5% glucose and 0.45% saline at 150每250 mL/h when plasma glucose reaches 200 mg/dL (11.2 mmol/L). 
5. Administer short-acting insulin: IV (0.1 units/kg), then 0.1 units/kg per hour by continuous IV infusion; increase two- to threefold if no response by 2每4 h. If the initial serum potassium is <3.3 mmol/L (3.3 meq/L), do not administer insulin until the potassium is corrected. If the initial serum potassium is >5.2 mmol/L (5.2 meq/L), do not supplement K+ until the potassium is corrected.
  
6. Assess patient: What precipitated the episode (noncompliance, infection, trauma, infarction, cocaine)? Initiate appropriate workup for precipitating event (cultures, CXR, ECG). 
7. Measure capillary glucose every 1每2 h; measure electrolytes (especially K+, bicarbonate, phosphate) and anion gap every 4 h for first 24 h.
  
8. Monitor blood pressure, pulse, respirations, mental status, fluid intake and output every 1每4 h. 
9. Replace K+: 10 meq/h when plasma K+ < 5.0每5.2 meq/L (or 20每30 meq/L of infusion fluid), ECG normal, urine flow and normal creatinine documented; administer 40每80 meq/h when plasma K+ < 3.5 meq/L or if bicarbonate is given. See text about bicarbonate or phosphate supplementation.
  
10. Continue above until patient is stable, glucose goal is 8.3每13.9 mmol/L (150每250 mg/dL), and acidosis is resolved. Insulin infusion may be decreased to 0.05每0.1 units/kg per hour. 
11. Administer long-acting insulin as soon as patient is eating. Allow for overlap in insulin infusion and SC insulin injection.

After the initial bolus of normal saline, replacement of the sodium and free water deficit is carried out over the next 24 h (fluid deficit is often 3每5 L). When hemodynamic stability and adequate urine output are achieved, IV fluids should be switched to 0.45% saline depending on the calculated volume deficit. The change to 0.45% saline helps to reduce the trend toward hyperchloremia later in the course of DKA. Alternatively, initial use of lactated Ringer's IV solution may reduce the hyperchloremia that commonly occurs with normal saline.

A bolus of IV (0.1 units/kg) short-acting insulin should be administered immediately (Table 344-6), and subsequent treatment should provide continuous and adequate levels of circulating insulin. IV administration is preferred (0.1 units/kg of regular insulin per hour), because it ensures rapid distribution and allows adjustment of the infusion rate as the patient responds to therapy. In mild episodes of DKA, short-acting insulin analogues can be used SC. IV insulin should be continued until the acidosis resolves and the patient is metabolically stable. As the acidosis and insulin resistance associated with DKA resolve, the insulin infusion rate can be decreased (to 0.05每0.1 units/kg per hour). Long-acting insulin, in combination with SC short-acting insulin, should be administered as soon as the patient resumes eating, as this facilitates transition to an outpatient insulin regimen and reduces length of hospital stay. It is crucial to continue the insulin infusion until adequate insulin levels are achieved by administering long-acting insulin by the SC route. Even relatively brief periods of inadequate insulin administration in this transition phase may result in DKA relapse.

Hyperglycemia usually improves at a rate of 4.2每5.6 mmol/L (75每100 mg/dL) per hour as a result of insulin-mediated glucose disposal, reduced hepatic glucose release, and rehydration. The latter reduces catecholamines, increases urinary glucose loss, and expands the intravascular volume. The decline in the plasma glucose within the first 1每2 h may be more rapid and is mostly related to volume expansion. When the plasma glucose reaches 11.2 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), glucose should be added to the 0.45% saline infusion to maintain the plasma glucose in the 8.3每13.9 mmol/L (150每250 mg/dL) range, and the insulin infusion should be continued. Ketoacidosis begins to resolve as insulin reduces lipolysis, increases peripheral ketone body use, suppresses hepatic ketone body formation, and promotes bicarbonate regeneration. However, the acidosis and ketosis resolve more slowly than hyperglycemia. As ketoacidosis improves, -hydroxybutyrate is converted to acetoacetate. Ketone body levels may appear to increase if measured by laboratory assays that use the nitroprusside reaction, which only detects acetoacetate and acetone. The improvement in acidosis and anion gap, a result of bicarbonate regeneration and decline in ketone bodies, is reflected by a rise in the serum bicarbonate level and the arterial pH. Depending on the rise of serum chloride, the anion gap (but not bicarbonate) will normalize. A hyperchloremic acidosis [serum bicarbonate of 15每18 mmol/L (15每18 meq/L)] often follows successful treatment and gradually resolves as the kidneys regenerate bicarbonate and excrete chloride.

Potassium stores are depleted in DKA [estimated deficit 3每5 mmol/kg (3每5 meq/kg)]. During treatment with insulin and fluids, various factors contribute to the development of hypokalemia. These include insulin-mediated potassium transport into cells, resolution of the acidosis (which also promotes potassium entry into cells), and urinary loss of potassium salts of organic acids. Thus, potassium repletion should commence as soon as adequate urine output and a normal serum potassium are documented. If the initial serum potassium level is elevated, then potassium repletion should be delayed until the potassium falls into the normal range. Inclusion of 20每40 meq of potassium in each liter of IV fluid is reasonable, but additional potassium supplements may also be required. To reduce the amount of chloride administered, potassium phosphate or acetate can be substituted for the chloride salt. The goal is to maintain the serum potassium at >3.5 mmol/L (3.5 meq/L).

Despite a bicarbonate deficit, bicarbonate replacement is not usually necessary. In fact, theoretical arguments suggest that bicarbonate administration and rapid reversal of acidosis may impair cardiac function, reduce tissue oxygenation, and promote hypokalemia. The results of most clinical trials do not support the routine use of bicarbonate replacement, and one study in children found that bicarbonate use was associated with an increased risk of cerebral edema. However, in the presence of severe acidosis (arterial pH <6.9), the ADA advises bicarbonate [50 mmol/L (meq/L) of sodium bicarbonate in 200 mL of sterile water with 10 meq/L KCl per hour for 2 h until the pH is >7.0]. Hypophosphatemia may result from increased glucose usage, but randomized clinical trials have not demonstrated that phosphate replacement is beneficial in DKA. If the serum phosphate < 0.32 mmol/L (1 mg/dL), then phosphate supplement should be considered and the serum calcium monitored. Hypomagnesemia may develop during DKA therapy and may also require supplementation.

With appropriate therapy, the mortality rate of DKA is low (<1%) and is related more to the underlying or precipitating event, such as infection or myocardial infarction. Venous thrombosis, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and acute respiratory distress syndrome occasionally complicate DKA. The major nonmetabolic complication of DKA therapy is cerebral edema, which most often develops in children as DKA is resolving. The etiology of and optimal therapy for cerebral edema are not well established, but overreplacement of free water should be avoided.

Following treatment, the physician and patient should review the sequence of events that led to DKA to prevent future recurrences. Foremost is patient education about the symptoms of DKA, its precipitating factors, and the management of diabetes during a concurrent illness. During illness or when oral intake is compromised, patients should (1) frequently measure the capillary blood glucose; (2) measure urinary ketones when the serum glucose > 16.5 mmol/L (300 mg/dL); (3) drink fluids to maintain hydration; (4) continue or increase insulin; and (5) seek medical attention if dehydration, persistent vomiting, or uncontrolled hyperglycemia develop. Using these strategies, early DKA can be prevented or detected and treated appropriately on an outpatient basis.

Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar State

Clinical Features

The prototypical patient with HHS is an elderly individual with type 2 DM, with a several-week history of polyuria, weight loss, and diminished oral intake that culminates in mental confusion, lethargy, or coma. The physical examination reflects profound dehydration and hyperosmolality and reveals hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mental status. Notably absent are symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and the Kussmaul respirations characteristic of DKA. HHS is often precipitated by a serious, concurrent illness such as myocardial infarction or stroke. Sepsis, pneumonia, and other serious infections are frequent precipitants and should be sought. In addition, a debilitating condition (prior stroke or dementia) or social situation that compromises water intake usually contributes to the development of the disorder.

Pathophysiology

Relative insulin deficiency and inadequate fluid intake are the underlying causes of HHS. Insulin deficiency increases hepatic glucose production (through glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis) and impairs glucose utilization in skeletal muscle (see above discussion of DKA). Hyperglycemia induces an osmotic diuresis that leads to intravascular volume depletion, which is exacerbated by inadequate fluid replacement. The absence of ketosis in HHS is not understood. Presumably, the insulin deficiency is only relative and less severe than in DKA. Lower levels of counterregulatory hormones and free fatty acids have been found in HHS than in DKA in some studies. It is also possible that the liver is less capable of ketone body synthesis or that the insulin/glucagon ratio does not favor ketogenesis.

Laboratory Abnormalities and Diagnosis

The laboratory features in HHS are summarized in Table 344-4. Most notable are the marked hyperglycemia [plasma glucose may be >55.5 mmol/L (1000 mg/dL)], hyperosmolality (>350 mosmol/L), and prerenal azotemia. The measured serum sodium may be normal or slightly low despite the marked hyperglycemia. The corrected serum sodium is usually increased [add 1.6 meq to measured sodium for each 5.6-mmol/L (100 mg/dL) rise in the serum glucose]. In contrast to DKA, acidosis and ketonemia are absent or mild. A small anion-gap metabolic acidosis may be present secondary to increased lactic acid. Moderate ketonuria, if present, is secondary to starvation.

Treatment: Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar State

Volume depletion and hyperglycemia are prominent features of both HHS and DKA. Consequently, therapy of these disorders shares several elements (Table 344-6). In both disorders, careful monitoring of the patient's fluid status, laboratory values, and insulin infusion rate is crucial. Underlying or precipitating problems should be aggressively sought and treated. In HHS, fluid losses and dehydration are usually more pronounced than in DKA due to the longer duration of the illness. The patient with HHS is usually older, more likely to have mental status changes, and more likely to have a life-threatening precipitating event with accompanying comorbidities. Even with proper treatment, HHS has a substantially higher mortality rate than DKA (up to 15% in some clinical series).

Fluid replacement should initially stabilize the hemodynamic status of the patient (1每3 L of 0.9% normal saline over the first 2每3 h). Because the fluid deficit in HHS is accumulated over a period of days to weeks, the rapidity of reversal of the hyperosmolar state must balance the need for free water repletion with the risk that too rapid a reversal may worsen neurologic function. If the serum sodium > 150 mmol/L (150 meq/L), 0.45% saline should be used. After hemodynamic stability is achieved, the IV fluid administration is directed at reversing the free water deficit using hypotonic fluids (0.45% saline initially, then 5% dextrose in water, D5W). The calculated free water deficit (which averages 9每10 L) should be reversed over the next 1每2 days (infusion rates of 200每300 mL/h of hypotonic solution). Potassium repletion is usually necessary and should be dictated by repeated measurements of the serum potassium. In patients taking diuretics, the potassium deficit can be quite large and may be accompanied by magnesium deficiency. Hypophosphatemia may occur during therapy and can be improved by using KPO4 and beginning nutrition.

As in DKA, rehydration and volume expansion lower the plasma glucose initially, but insulin is also required. A reasonable regimen for HHS begins with an IV insulin bolus of 0.1 units/kg followed by IV insulin at a constant infusion rate of 0.1 units/kg per hour. If the serum glucose does not fall, increase the insulin infusion rate by twofold. As in DKA, glucose should be added to IV fluid when the plasma glucose falls to 13.9每16.7 mmol/L (250每300 mg/dL), and the insulin infusion rate should be decreased to 0.05每0.1 units/kg per hour. The insulin infusion should be continued until the patient has resumed eating and can be transferred to a SC insulin regimen. The patient should be discharged from the hospital on insulin, though some patients can later switch to oral glucose-lowering agents.
 
Chronic Complications of DM

The chronic complications of DM affect many organ systems and are responsible for the majority of morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Chronic complications can be divided into vascular and nonvascular complications (Table 344-7). The vascular complications of DM are further subdivided into microvascular (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy) and macrovascular complications [coronary heart disease (CHD), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), cerebrovascular disease]. Nonvascular complications include problems such as gastroparesis, infections, and skin changes. Long-standing diabetes may be associated with hearing loss. Whether type 2 DM in elderly individuals is associated with impaired mental function is not clear.

The risk of chronic complications increases as a function of the duration and degree of hyperglycemia; they usually do not become apparent until the second decade of hyperglycemia. Since type 2 DM often has a long asymptomatic period of hyperglycemia, many individuals with type 2 DM have complications at the time of diagnosis.

The microvascular complications of both type 1 and type 2 DM result from chronic hyperglycemia. Large, randomized clinical trials of individuals with type 1 or type 2 DM have conclusively demonstrated that a reduction in chronic hyperglycemia prevents or delays retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. Other incompletely defined factors may modulate the development of complications. For example, despite long-standing DM, some individuals never develop nephropathy or retinopathy. Many of these patients have glycemic control that is indistinguishable from those who develop microvascular complications, suggesting that there is a genetic susceptibility for developing particular complications.

Evidence implicating a causative role for chronic hyperglycemia in the development of macrovascular complications is less conclusive. However, coronary heart disease events and mortality rate are two to four times greater in patients with type 2 DM. These events correlate with fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels as well as with the A1C. Other factors (dyslipidemia and hypertension) also play important roles in macrovascular complications.

Mechanisms of Complications

Although chronic hyperglycemia is an important etiologic factor leading to complications of DM, the mechanism(s) by which it leads to such diverse cellular and organ dysfunction is unknown. At least four prominent theories, which are not mutually exclusive, have been proposed to explain how hyperglycemia might lead to the chronic complications of DM. An emerging hypothesis is that hyperglycemia leads to epigenetic changes in the affected cells.

One theory is that increased intracellular glucose leads to the formation of advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs), which bind to a cell surface receptor, via the nonenzymatic glycosylation of intra- and extracellular proteins. Nonenzymatic glycosylation results from the interaction of glucose with amino groups on proteins. AGEs have been shown to cross-link proteins (e.g., collagen, extracellular matrix proteins), accelerate atherosclerosis, promote glomerular dysfunction, reduce nitric oxide synthesis, induce endothelial dysfunction, and alter extracellular matrix composition and structure. The serum level of AGEs correlates with the level of glycemia, and these products accumulate as the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) declines.

A second theory is based on the observation that hyperglycemia increases glucose metabolism via the sorbitol pathway. Intracellular glucose is predominantly metabolized by phosphorylation and subsequent glycolysis, but when increased, some glucose is converted to sorbitol by the enzyme aldose reductase. Increased sorbitol concentration alters redox potential, increases cellular osmolality, generates reactive oxygen species, and likely leads to other types of cellular dysfunction. However, testing of this theory in humans, using aldose reductase inhibitors, has not demonstrated significant beneficial effects on clinical endpoints of retinopathy, neuropathy, or nephropathy.

A third hypothesis proposes that hyperglycemia increases the formation of diacylglycerol leading to activation of protein kinase C (PKC). Among other actions, PKC alters the transcription of genes for fibronectin, type IV collagen, contractile proteins, and extracellular matrix proteins in endothelial cells and neurons. Inhibitors of PKC are being studied in clinical trials.

A fourth theory proposes that hyperglycemia increases the flux through the hexosamine pathway, which generates fructose-6-phosphate, a substrate for O-linked glycosylation and proteoglycan production. The hexosamine pathway may alter function by glycosylation of proteins such as endothelial nitric oxide synthase or by changes in gene expression of transforming growth factor  (TGF-) or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1).

Growth factors appear to play an important role in some DM-related complications, and their production is increased by most of these proposed pathways. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) is increased locally in diabetic proliferative retinopathy and decreases after laser photocoagulation. TGF- is increased in diabetic nephropathy and stimulates basement membrane production of collagen and fibronectin by mesangial cells. Other growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor I, growth hormone, basic fibroblast growth factor, and even insulin, have been suggested to play a role in DM-related complications. A possible unifying mechanism is that hyperglycemia leads to increased production of reactive oxygen species or superoxide in the mitochondria; these compounds may activate all four of the pathways described above. Although hyperglycemia serves as the initial trigger for complications of diabetes, it is still unknown whether the same pathophysiologic processes are operative in all complications or whether some pathways predominate in certain organs.

Glycemic Control and Complications

The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) provided definitive proof that reduction in chronic hyperglycemia can prevent many of the early complications of type 1 DM. This large multicenter clinical trial randomized more than 1400 individuals with type 1 DM to either intensive or conventional diabetes management and prospectively evaluated the development of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Individuals in the intensive diabetes management group received multiple administrations of insulin each day along with extensive educational, psychological, and medical support. Individuals in the conventional diabetes management group received twice-daily insulin injections and quarterly nutritional, educational, and clinical evaluation. The goal in the former group was normoglycemia; the goal in the latter group was prevention of symptoms of diabetes. Individuals in the intensive diabetes management group achieved a substantially lower hemoglobin A1C (7.3%) than individuals in the conventional diabetes management group (9.1%).

The DCCT demonstrated that improvement of glycemic control reduced nonproliferative and proliferative retinopathy (47% reduction), microalbuminuria (39% reduction), clinical nephropathy (54% reduction), and neuropathy (60% reduction). Improved glycemic control also slowed the progression of early diabetic complications. There was a nonsignificant trend in reduction of macrovascular events during the trial (most individuals were young and had a low risk of cardiovascular disease). The results of the DCCT predicted that individuals in the intensive diabetes management group would gain 7.7 additional years of vision, 5.8 additional years free from ESRD, and 5.6 years free from lower extremity amputations. If all complications of DM were combined, individuals in the intensive diabetes management group would experience 15.3 more years of life without significant microvascular or neurologic complications of DM, compared to individuals who received standard therapy. This translates into an additional 5.1 years of life expectancy for individuals in the intensive diabetes management group. The long-term prognosis for type 1 diabetes continues to improve as shown by 30-year incidence data in the intensively treated group from the DCCT of retinopathy (21%), nephropathy (9%), and cardiovascular disease (9%). During this follow-up, fewer than 1% of the cohort had become blind, lost a limb to amputation, or required dialysis. The benefit of the improved glycemic control during the DCCT persisted even after the study concluded and glycemic control worsened. For example, individuals in the intensive diabetes management group for a mean of 6.5 years had a 42每57% reduction in cardiovascular events [nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or death from a cardiovascular event] at a mean follow-up of 17 years, even though their subsequent glycemic control was the same as those in the conventional diabetes management group from years 6.5每17 (discussed below).

The benefits of an improvement in glycemic control occurred over the entire range of A1C values (Fig. 344-8), suggesting that at any A1C level, an improvement in glycemic control is beneficial. The goal of therapy is to achieve an A1C level as close to normal as possible, without subjecting the patient to excessive risk of hypoglycemia.

The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) studied the course of >5000 individuals with type 2 DM for >10 years. This study utilized multiple treatment regimens and monitored the effect of intensive glycemic control and risk factor treatment on the development of diabetic complications. Newly diagnosed individuals with type 2 DM were randomized to (1) intensive management using various combinations of insulin, a sulfonylurea, or metformin or (2) conventional therapy using dietary modification and pharmacotherapy with the goal of symptom prevention. In addition, individuals were randomly assigned to different antihypertensive regimens. Individuals in the intensive treatment arm achieved an A1C of 7%, compared to a 7.9% A1C in the standard treatment group. The UKPDS demonstrated that each percentage point reduction in A1C was associated with a 35% reduction in microvascular complications. As in the DCCT, there was a continuous relationship between glycemic control and development of complications. Improved glycemic control did not conclusively reduce (nor worsen) cardiovascular mortality rate during the period of the trial, but was associated with improvement with lipoprotein risk profiles, such as reduced triglycerides and increased HDL.

One of the major findings of the UKPDS was that strict blood pressure control significantly reduced both macro- and microvascular complications. In fact, the beneficial effects of blood pressure control were greater than the beneficial effects of glycemic control. Lowering blood pressure to moderate goals (144/82 mmHg) reduced the risk of DM-related death, stroke, microvascular end- points, retinopathy, and heart failure (risk reductions between 32 and 56%).

Similar reductions in the risks of retinopathy and nephropathy were also seen in a small trial of lean Japanese individuals with type 2 DM randomized to either intensive glycemic control or standard therapy with insulin (Kumamoto study). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of improved glycemic control in individuals of different ethnicity and, presumably, a different etiology of DM (i.e., phenotypically different from those in the DCCT and UKPDS).

The findings of the DCCT, UKPDS, and Kumamoto study strongly support the idea that chronic hyperglycemia plays a causative role in the pathogenesis of diabetic microvascular complications. These landmark studies prove the value of metabolic control and emphasize the importance of (1) intensive glycemic control in all forms of DM and (2) early diagnosis and strict blood pressure control in type 2 DM. Optimal targets for glycemic control and blood pressure are not entirely clear (see below).

Ophthalmologic Complications of Diabetes Mellitus

DM is the leading cause of blindness between the ages of 20 and 74 in the United States. The gravity of this problem is highlighted by the finding that individuals with DM are 25 times more likely to become legally blind than individuals without DM. Blindness is primarily the result of progressive diabetic retinopathy and clinically significant macular edema. Diabetic retinopathy is classified into two stages: nonproliferative and proliferative. Nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy usually appears late in the first decade or early in the second decade of the disease and is marked by retinal vascular microaneurysms, blot hemorrhages, and cotton-wool spots (Fig. 344-9). Mild nonproliferative retinopathy progresses to more extensive disease, characterized by changes in venous vessel caliber, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities, and more numerous microaneurysms and hemorrhages. The pathophysiologic mechanisms invoked in nonproliferative retinopathy include loss of retinal pericytes, increased retinal vascular permeability, alterations in retinal blood flow, and abnormal retinal microvasculature, all of which lead to retinal ischemia.

Figure 344-9

 
 
 
Diabetic retinopathy results in scattered hemorrhages, yellow exudates, and neovascularization. This patient has neovascular vessels proliferating from the optic disc, requiring urgent panretinal laser photocoagulation.
 
 

The appearance of neovascularization in response to retinal hypoxemia is the hallmark of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (Fig. 344-9). These newly formed vessels appear near the optic nerve and/or macula and rupture easily, leading to vitreous hemorrhage, fibrosis, and ultimately retinal detachment. Not all individuals with nonproliferative retinopathy develop proliferative retinopathy, but the more severe the nonproliferative disease, the greater the chance of evolution to proliferative retinopathy within 5 years. This creates an important opportunity for early detection and treatment of diabetic retinopathy. Clinically significant macular edema can occur when only nonproliferative retinopathy is present. Fluorescein angiography is useful to detect macular edema, which is associated with a 25% chance of moderate visual loss over the next 3 years.

Duration of DM and degree of glycemic control are the best predictors of the development of retinopathy; hypertension is also a risk factor. Nonproliferative retinopathy is found in many individuals who have had DM for >20 years (25% incidence with 5 years, and 80% incidence with 15 years of type 1 DM). Although there is genetic susceptibility for retinopathy, it confers less influence than either the duration of DM or the degree of glycemic control.

Treatment: Diabetic Retinopathy

The most effective therapy for diabetic retinopathy is prevention. Intensive glycemic and blood pressure control will delay the development or slow the progression of retinopathy in individuals with either type 1 or type 2 DM. Paradoxically, during the first 6每12 months of improved glycemic control, established diabetic retinopathy may transiently worsen. Fortunately, this progression is temporary, and in the long term, improved glycemic control is associated with less diabetic retinopathy. Individuals with known retinopathy are candidates for prophylactic photocoagulation when initiating intensive therapy. Once advanced retinopathy is present, improved glycemic control imparts less benefit, though adequate ophthalmologic care can prevent most blindness.

Regular, comprehensive eye examinations are essential for all individuals with DM. Most diabetic eye disease can be successfully treated if detected early. Routine, nondilated eye examinations by the primary care provider or diabetes specialist are inadequate to detect diabetic eye disease, which requires an ophthalmologist for optimal care of these disorders. Laser photocoagulation is very successful in preserving vision. Proliferative retinopathy is usually treated with panretinal laser photocoagulation, whereas macular edema is treated with focal laser photocoagulation. Although exercise has not been conclusively shown to worsen proliferative diabetic retinopathy, most ophthalmologists advise individuals with advanced diabetic eye disease to limit physical activities associated with repeated Valsalva maneuvers. Aspirin therapy (650 mg/d) does not appear to influence the natural history of diabetic retinopathy.

Renal Complications of Diabetes Mellitus

Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of ESRD in the United States and a leading cause of DM-related morbidity and mortality. Both microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria in individuals with DM are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Individuals with diabetic nephropathy commonly have diabetic retinopathy.

Like other microvascular complications, the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy is related to chronic hyperglycemia. The mechanisms by which chronic hyperglycemia leads to ESRD, though incompletely defined, involve the effects of soluble factors (growth factors, angiotensin II, endothelin, AGEs), hemodynamic alterations in the renal microcirculation (glomerular hyperfiltration or hyperperfusion, increased glomerular capillary pressure), and structural changes in the glomerulus (increased extracellular matrix, basement membrane thickening, mesangial expansion, fibrosis). Some of these effects may be mediated through angiotensin II receptors. Smoking accelerates the decline in renal function. Because only 20每40% of patients with diabetes develop diabetic nephropathy, additional susceptibility factors remain unidentified. One known risk factor is a family history of diabetic nephropathy.

The natural history of diabetic nephropathy is characterized by a fairly predictable sequence of events that was initially defined for individuals with type 1 DM but appears to be similar in type 2 DM (Fig. 344-10). Glomerular hyperperfusion and renal hypertrophy occur in the first years after the onset of DM and are associated with an increase of the GFR. During the first 5 years of DM, thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, glomerular hypertrophy, and mesangial volume expansion occur as the GFR returns to normal. After 5每10 years of type 1 DM, 40% of individuals begin to excrete small amounts of albumin in the urine. Microalbuminuria is defined as 30每299 mg/d in a 24-h collection or 30每299 g/mg creatinine in a spot collection (preferred method). Although the appearance of microalbuminuria in type 1 DM is an important risk factor for progression to macroalbuminuria (>300 mg/d or > 300 g/mg creatinine), only 50% of individuals progress to macroalbuminuria over the next 10 years. In some individuals with type 1 diabetes and microalbuminuria of short duration, the microalbuminuria regresses. Microalbuminuria is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Once macroalbuminuria is present, there is a steady decline in GFR, and 50% of individuals reach ESRD in 7每10 years. Once macroalbuminuria develops, blood pressure rises slightly and the pathologic changes are likely irreversible.

The nephropathy that develops in type 2 DM differs from that of type 1 DM in the following respects: (1) microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria may be present when type 2 DM is diagnosed, reflecting its long asymptomatic period; (2) hypertension more commonly accompanies microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria in type 2 DM; and (3) microalbuminuria may be less predictive of diabetic nephropathy and progression to macroalbuminuria in type 2 DM. Finally, it should be noted that albuminuria in type 2 DM may be secondary to factors unrelated to DM, such as hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF), prostate disease, or infection. Diabetic nephropathy and ESRD secondary to DM develop more commonly in African Americans, Native Americans, and Hispanic individuals than in Caucasians with type 2 DM.

Type IV renal tubular acidosis (hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism) may occur in type 1 or 2 DM. These individuals develop a propensity to hyperkalemia, which may be exacerbated by medications [especially angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)]. Patients with DM are predisposed to radiocontrast-induced nephrotoxicity. Risk factors for radiocontrast-induced nephrotoxicity are preexisting nephropathy and volume depletion. Individuals with DM undergoing radiographic procedures with contrast dye should be well hydrated before and after dye exposure, and the serum creatinine should be monitored for 24每48 h following the procedure.

Treatment: Diabetic Nephropathy

The optimal therapy for diabetic nephropathy is prevention by control of glycemia. As part of comprehensive diabetes care, microalbuminuria should be detected at an early stage when effective therapies can be instituted. The recommended strategy for detecting microalbuminuria is outlined in Fig. 344-11. Since some individuals with type 1 or type 2 DM have a decline in GFR in the absence of micro- or macroalbuminuria, annual measurement of the serum creatinine to estimate GFR should also be performed. Interventions effective in slowing progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria include (1) normalization of glycemia, (2) strict blood pressure control, and (3) administration of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Dyslipidemia should also be treated.

Screening for microalbuminuria should be performed in patients with type 1 diabetes for 5 years, in patients with type 2 diabetes, and during pregnancy. Non-diabetes-related conditions that might increase microalbuminuria are urinary tract infection, hematuria, heart failure, febrile illness, severe hyperglycemia, severe hypertension, and vigorous exercise. (Adapted from RA DeFronzo, in Therapy for Diabetes Mellitus and Related Disorders, 3rd ed. American Diabetes Association, Alexandria, VA, 1998.)
 
 

Improved glycemic control reduces the rate at which microalbuminuria appears and progresses in type 1 and type 2 DM. However, once macroalbuminuria exists, it is unclear whether improved glycemic control will slow progression of renal disease. During the later phase of declining renal function, insulin requirements may fall as the kidney is a site of insulin degradation. Furthermore, many glucose-lowering medications (sulfonylureas and metformin) are contraindicated in advanced renal insufficiency.

Many individuals with type 1 or type 2 DM develop hypertension. Numerous studies in both type 1 and type 2 DM demonstrate the effectiveness of strict blood pressure control in reducing albumin excretion and slowing the decline in renal function. Blood pressure should be maintained at <130/80 mmHg in diabetic individuals.

Either ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be used to reduce the progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria and the associated decline in GFR that accompanies macroalbumin-uria in individuals with type 1 or type 2 DM (see "Hypertension," below). Although direct comparisons of ACE inhibitors and ARBs are lacking, most experts believe that the two classes of drugs are equivalent in the patient with diabetes. ARBs can be used as an alternative in patients who develop ACE inhibitor每associated cough or angioedema. After 2每3 months of therapy in patients with microalbuminuria, the drug dose is increased until either the microalbuminuria disappears or the maximum dose is reached. If use of either ACE inhibitors or ARBs is not possible or the blood pressure is not controlled, then calcium channel blockers (non-dihydropyridine class), beta blockers, or diuretics should be used. However, their efficacy in slowing the fall in the GFR is not proven. Blood pressure control with any agent is extremely important, but a drug-specific benefit in diabetic nephropathy, independent of blood pressure control, has been shown only for ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with DM.

The ADA suggests modest restriction of protein intake in diabetic individuals with microalbuminuria (0.8每1.0 g/kg per day) or macroalbuminuria (<0.8 g/kg per day).

Nephrology consultation should be considered when the estimated GFR <60 mL/min per 1.743 m2. Once macroalbuminuria ensues, the likelihood of ESRD is very high. As compared to nondiabetic individuals, hemodialysis in patients with DM is associated with more frequent complications, such as hypotension (due to autonomic neuropathy or loss of reflex tachycardia), more difficult vascular access, and accelerated progression of retinopathy. Survival after the onset of ESRD is shorter in the diabetic population compared to nondiabetics with similar clinical features. Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death in diabetic individuals on dialysis, and hyperlipidemia should be treated aggressively. Renal transplantation from a living related donor is the preferred therapy but requires chronic immunosuppression. Combined pancreas-kidney transplant offers the promise of normoglycemia and freedom from dialysis.

Neuropathy and Diabetes Mellitus

Diabetic neuropathy occurs in 50% of individuals with long-standing type 1 and type 2 DM. It may manifest as polyneuropathy, mononeuropathy, and/or autonomic neuropathy. As with other complications of DM, the development of neuropathy correlates with the duration of diabetes and glycemic control. Additional risk factors are BMI (the greater the BMI, the greater the risk of neurop-athy) and smoking. The presence of cardiovascular disease, elevated triglycerides, and hypertension is also associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Both myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers are lost. Because the clinical features of diabetic neuropathy are similar to those of other neuropathies, the diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy should be made only after other possible etiologies are excluded (Chap. 384).

Polyneuropathy/Mononeuropathy

The most common form of diabetic neuropathy is distal symmetric polyneuropathy. It most frequently presents with distal sensory loss, but up to 50% of patients do not have symptoms of neuropathy. Hyperesthesia, paresthesia, and dysesthesia also may occur. Any combination of these symptoms may develop as neuropathy progresses. Symptoms may include a sensation of numbness, tingling, sharpness, or burning that begins in the feet and spreads proximally. Neuropathic pain develops in some of these individuals, occasionally preceded by improvement in their glycemic control. Pain typically involves the lower extremities, is usually present at rest, and worsens at night. Both an acute (lasting <12 months) and a chronic form of painful diabetic neuropathy have been described. As diabetic neuropathy progresses, the pain subsides and eventually disappears, but a sensory deficit in the lower extremities persists. Physical examination reveals sensory loss, loss of ankle reflexes, and abnormal position sense.

Diabetic polyradiculopathy is a syndrome characterized by severe disabling pain in the distribution of one or more nerve roots. It may be accompanied by motor weakness. Intercostal or truncal radiculopathy causes pain over the thorax or abdomen. Involvement of the lumbar plexus or femoral nerve may cause severe pain in the thigh or hip and may be associated with muscle weakness in the hip flexors or extensors (diabetic amyotrophy). Fortunately, diabetic polyradiculopathies are usually self-limited and resolve over 6每12 months.

Mononeuropathy (dysfunction of isolated cranial or peripheral nerves) is less common than polyneuropathy in DM and presents with pain and motor weakness in the distribution of a single nerve. A vascular etiology has been suggested, but the pathogenesis is unknown. Involvement of the third cranial nerve is most common and is heralded by diplopia. Physical examination reveals ptosis and ophthalmoplegia with normal pupillary constriction to light. Sometimes other cranial nerves IV, VI, or VII (Bell's palsy) are affected. Peripheral mononeuropathies or simultaneous involvement of more than one nerve (mononeuropathy multiplex) may also occur.

Autonomic Neuropathy

Individuals with long-standing type 1 or 2 DM may develop signs of autonomic dysfunction involving the cholinergic, noradrenergic, and peptidergic (peptides such as pancreatic polypeptide, substance P, etc.) systems. DM-related autonomic neuropathy can involve multiple systems, including the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, sudomotor, and metabolic systems. Autonomic neuropathies affecting the cardiovascular system cause a resting tachycardia and orthostatic hypotension. Reports of sudden death have also been attributed to autonomic neuropathy. Gastroparesis and bladder-emptying abnormalities are often caused by the autonomic neuropathy seen in DM (discussed below). Hyperhidrosis of the upper extremities and anhidrosis of the lower extremities result from sympathetic nervous system dysfunction. Anhidrosis of the feet can promote dry skin with cracking, which increases the risk of foot ulcers. Autonomic neuropathy may reduce counterregulatory hormone release (especially catecholamines), leading to an inability to sense hypoglycemia appropriately (hypoglycemia unawareness; Chap. 345), thereby subjecting the patient to the risk of severe hypoglycemia and complicating efforts to improve glycemic control.

Treatment: Diabetic Neuropathy

Treatment of diabetic neuropathy is less than satisfactory. Improved glycemic control should be aggressively pursued and will improve nerve conduction velocity, but symptoms of diabetic neuropathy may not necessarily improve. Efforts to improve glycemic control may be confounded by autonomic neuropathy and hypoglycemia unawareness. Risk factors for neuropathy such as hypertension and hypertriglyceridemia should be treated. Avoidance of neurotoxins (alcohol) and smoking, supplementation with vitamins for possible deficiencies (B12, folate; Chap. 74), and symptomatic treatment are the mainstays of therapy. Loss of sensation in the foot places the patient at risk for ulceration and its sequelae; consequently, prevention of such problems is of paramount importance. Patients with symptoms or signs of neuropathy (see "Physical Examination," below) should check their feet daily and take precautions (footwear) aimed at preventing calluses or ulcerations. If foot deformities are present, a podiatrist should be involved.

Chronic, painful diabetic neuropathy is difficult to treat but may respond to antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, desipramine, nortriptyline, imipramine or selective serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as duloxetine) or anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine). Two agents, duloxetine and pregabalin, have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for pain associated with diabetic neuropathy. However, pending further study, most recommend beginning with other agents such as a tricyclic antidepressant and switching if there is no response or if side effects develop. Referral to a pain management center may be necessary. Since the pain of acute diabetic neuropathy may resolve over time, medications may be discontinued as progressive neuronal damage from DM occurs.

Therapy of orthostatic hypotension secondary to autonomic neuropathy is also challenging. A variety of agents have limited success (fludrocortisone, midodrine, clonidine, octreotide, and yohimbine) but each has significant side effects. Nonpharmacologic maneuvers (adequate salt intake, avoidance of dehydration and diuretics, and lower extremity support hose) may offer some benefit.

Gastrointestinal/Genitourinary Dysfunction

Long-standing type 1 and 2 DM may affect the motility and function of gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary systems. The most prominent GI symptoms are delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis) and altered small- and large-bowel motility (constipation or diarrhea). Gastroparesis may present with symptoms of anorexia, nausea, vomiting, early satiety, and abdominal bloating. Microvascular complications (retinopathy and neuropathy) are usually present. Nuclear medicine scintigraphy after ingestion of a radiolabeled meal may document delayed gastric emptying, but may not correlate well with the patient's symptoms. Noninvasive "breath tests" following ingestion of a radiolabeled meal are under development. Though parasympathetic dysfunction secondary to chronic hyperglycemia is important in the development of gastroparesis, hyperglycemia itself also impairs gastric emptying. Nocturnal diarrhea, alternating with constipation, is a feature of DM-related GI autonomic neuropathy. In type 1 DM, these symptoms should also prompt evaluation for celiac sprue because of its increased frequency. Esophageal dysfunction in long-standing DM may occur but is usually asymptomatic.

Diabetic autonomic neuropathy may lead to genitourinary dysfunction including cystopathy, erectile dysfunction, and female sexual dysfunction (reduced sexual desire, dyspareunia, reduced vaginal lubrication). Symptoms of diabetic cystopathy begin with an inability to sense a full bladder and a failure to void completely. As bladder contractility worsens, bladder capacity and the postvoid residual increase, leading to symptoms of urinary hesitancy, decreased voiding frequency, incontinence, and recurrent urinary tract infections. Diagnostic evaluation includes cystometry and urodynamic studies.

Erectile dysfunction and retrograde ejaculation are very common in DM and may be one of the earliest signs of diabetic neuropathy (Chap. 48). Erectile dysfunction, which increases in frequency with the age of the patient and the duration of diabetes, may occur in the absence of other signs of diabetic autonomic neuropathy.

Treatment: Gastrointestinal/Genitourinary Dysfunction

Current treatments for these complications of DM are inadequate. Improved glycemic control should be a primary goal, as some aspects (neuropathy, gastric function) may improve. Smaller, more frequent meals that are easier to digest (liquid) and low in fat and fiber may minimize symptoms of gastroparesis. Agents with some efficacy include dopamine antagonists metoclopramide, 5每10 mg, and domperidone, 10每20 mg, before each meal. Erythromycin interacts with the motilin receptor and may promote gastric emptying. Diabetic diarrhea in the absence of bacterial overgrowth is treated symptomatically with loperamide and may respond to octreotide (50每75 g three times daily, SC). Treatment of bacterial overgrowth with antibiotics is sometimes useful (Chap. 294).

Diabetic cystopathy should be treated with timed voiding or self-catheterization, possibly with the addition of bethanechol. Drugs that inhibit type 5 phosphodiesterase are effective for erectile dysfunction, but their efficacy in individuals with DM is slightly lower than in the nondiabetic population (Chap. 48). Sexual dysfunction in women may be improved with use of vaginal lubricants, treatment of vaginal infections, and systemic or local estrogen replacement.

Cardiovascular Morbidity and Mortality

Cardiovascular disease is increased in individuals with type 1 or type 2 DM. The Framingham Heart Study revealed a marked increase in PAD, CHF, CHD, MI, and sudden death (risk increase from one- to fivefold) in DM. The American Heart Association has designated DM as a "CHD risk equivalent." Type 2 diabetes patients without a prior MI have a similar risk for coronary artery每related events as nondiabetic individuals who have had a prior MI. Because of the extremely high prevalence of underlying cardiovascular disease in individuals with diabetes (especially in type 2 DM), evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease (e.g., cardiac stress test) should be sought in an individual with diabetes who has symptoms suggestive of cardiac ischemia or peripheral or carotid arterial disease. The screening of asymptomatic individuals with diabetes for CHD is controversial, and recent studies have not shown a clinical benefit. The absence of chest pain ("silent ischemia") is common in individuals with diabetes, and a thorough cardiac evaluation should be considered in individuals undergoing major surgical procedures. The prognosis for individuals with diabetes who have CHD or MI is worse than for nondiabetics. CHD is more likely to involve multiple vessels in individuals with DM.

The increase in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates appears to relate to the synergism of hyperglycemia with other cardiovascular risk factors. For example, after controlling for all known cardiovascular risk factors, type 2 DM increases the cardiovascular death rate twofold in men and fourfold in women. Risk factors for macrovascular disease in diabetic individuals include dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, reduced physical activity, and cigarette smoking. Additional risk factors more prevalent in the diabetic population include microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria, an elevation of serum creatinine, and abnormal platelet function. Insulin resistance, as reflected by elevated serum insulin levels, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications in individuals with and without DM. Individuals with insulin resistance and type 2 DM have elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitors (especially PAI-1) and fibrinogen, which enhances the coagulation process and impairs fibrinolysis, thus favoring the development of thrombosis. Diabetes is also associated with endothelial, vascular smooth-muscle, and platelet dysfunction.

Improved glycemic control started soon after the diagnosis of diabetes reduces cardiovascular complications in DM, but the glycemic goal for individuals with long-standing diabetes remains unclear. In both the DCCT (type 1 diabetes) and the UKPDS (type 2 diabetes), cardiovascular events were not reduced by intensive treatment during the trial but were reduced at follow-up 10每17 years later (this effect has been termed legacy effect or metabolic memory). During the DCCT, an improvement in the lipid profile of individuals in the intensive group (lower total and LDL cholesterol, lower triglycerides) during intensive diabetes management was noted. Trials to examine whether very aggressive glycemic targets (A1C near 6%) reduce cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetes did not show a survival benefit of reducing the A1C below 7% (and in one trial, the outcome was worse). Current recommendations do not suggest more aggressive glucose lowering in this patient population. The possibility of atherogenic potential of insulin is suggested by the data in nondiabetic individuals showing higher serum insulin levels (indicative of insulin resistance) in association with greater risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, treatment with insulin and the sulfonylureas did not appear to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease in individuals with type 2 DM, refuting prior claims about the atherogenic potential of these agents.

In addition to CHD, cerebrovascular disease is increased in individuals with DM (threefold increase in stroke). Individuals with DM have an increased incidence of CHF. The etiology of this abnormality is probably multifactorial and includes factors such as myocardial ischemia from atherosclerosis, hypertension, and myocardial cell dysfunction secondary to chronic hyperglycemia.

Treatment: Cardiovascular Disease

In general, the treatment of coronary disease is not different in the diabetic individual (Chap. 243). Revascularization procedures for CHD, including percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), may be less efficacious in the diabetic individual. Initial success rates of PCI in diabetic individuals are similar to those in the nondiabetic population, but diabetic patients have higher rates of restenosis and lower long-term patency and survival rates in older studies. More recently, the use of drug-eluting stents and a GPIIb/IIIa platelet inhibitor has improved the outcomes in diabetic patients, and whether there is a difference in efficacy of PCI in diabetic individuals is not clear. Although CABG may be preferred over PCI in diabetic individuals with multivessel coronary artery disease or recent Q-wave MI, PCI is preferred in patients with single-vessel coronary artery disease or two-vessel disease (no involvement of left anterior descending).

The ADA has emphasized the importance of glycemic control and aggressive cardiovascular risk modification in all individuals with DM (see below). Past trepidation about using beta blockers in individuals who have diabetes should not prevent use of these agents since they clearly benefit diabetic patients after MI. ACE inhibitors (or ARBs) may also be particularly beneficial and should be considered in individuals with type 2 DM and other risk factors (smoking, dyslipidemia, history of cardiovascular disease, microalbuminuria). Patients with atypical chest pain or an abnormal resting ECG should be considered for screening for CHD.

Antiplatelet therapy reduces cardiovascular events in individuals with DM who have CHD. Current recommendations by the ADA include the use of aspirin for secondary prevention of coronary events and the consideration of aspirin use in diabetic individuals with an increased cardiovascular risk (based on risk stratification using risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, family history, albuminuria, or dyslipidemia). Data demonstrating efficacy of aspirin in primary prevention of coronary events in individuals with DM and a low risk for CHD are lacking. The aspirin dose (75每162 mg) is the same as that in nondiabetic individuals. Aspirin therapy does not have detrimental effects on renal function or hypertension, nor does it influence the course of diabetic retinopathy.

Cardiovascular Risk Factors

Dyslipidemia

Individuals with DM may have several forms of dyslipidemia (Chap. 356). Because of the additive cardiovascular risk of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, lipid abnormalities should be assessed aggressively and treated as part of comprehensive diabetes care. The most common pattern of dyslipidemia is hypertriglyceridemia and reduced HDL cholesterol levels. DM itself does not increase levels of LDL, but the small dense LDL particles found in type 2 DM are more atherogenic because they are more easily glycated and susceptible to oxidation.

Almost all treatment studies of diabetic dyslipidemia have been performed in individuals with type 2 DM because of the greater frequency of dyslipidemia in this form of diabetes. Interventional studies have shown that the beneficial effects of LDL reduction are similar in the diabetic and nondiabetic populations. Large prospective trials of primary and secondary intervention for CHD have included some individuals with type 2 DM, and subset analyses have consistently found that reductions in LDL reduce cardiovascular events and morbidity in individuals with DM. No prospective studies have addressed similar questions in individuals with type 1 DM. Since the frequency of cardiovascular disease is low in children and young adults with diabetes, assessment of CV risk should be incorporated into the guidelines discussed below.

Based on the guidelines provided by the ADA and the American Heart Association, priorities in the treatment of dyslipidemia are as follows: (1) lower the LDL cholesterol, (2) raise the HDL cholesterol, and (3) decrease the triglycerides. A treatment strategy depends on the pattern of lipoprotein abnormalities. Initial therapy for all forms of dyslipidemia should include dietary changes, as well as the same lifestyle modifications recommended in the nondiabetic population (smoking cessation, blood pressure control, weight loss, increased physical activity). The dietary recommendations for individuals with DM are similar to those advocated by the National Cholesterol Education Program (Chap. 356) and include increased monounsaturated fat and carbohydrates and reduced saturated fats and cholesterol. Though viewed as important, the response to dietary alterations is often modest (<10% reduction in the LDL). Improvement in glycemic control will lower triglycerides and have a modest beneficial effect by raising HDL. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are the agents of choice for lowering the LDL. According to guidelines of the ADA and the American Heart Association, the target lipid values in diabetic individuals (age >40 years) without cardiovascular disease should be as follows: LDL < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL); HDL >1 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) in men and >1.3 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) in women; and triglycerides <1.7 mmol/L (150 mg/dL). In patients >40 years, the ADA recommends addition of a statin, regardless of the LDL level in patients with CHD and those without CHD, but who have CHD risk factors.

If the patient is known to have CHD, the ADA recommends an LDL goal of <1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) as an "option" [in keeping with evidence that such a goal is beneficial in nondiabetic individuals with CHD (Chap. 356)]. Older studies with fibrates indicated efficacy, but recent trials have not shown a benefit of this class of agents. Combination therapy with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and a fibrate or another lipid-lowering agent (ezetimibe, niacin) may be considered to reach LDL goals, but statin/fibrate combinations increase the possibility of side effects such as myositis. Nicotinic acid effectively raises HDL and can be used in patients with diabetes, but high doses (>2 g/d) may worsen glycemic control and increase insulin resistance. Bile acid每binding resins should not be used if hypertriglyceridemia is present.

Hypertension

Hypertension can accelerate other complications of DM, particularly cardiovascular disease and nephropathy. In targeting a goal of BP <130/80 mmHg, therapy should first emphasize life-style modifications such as weight loss, exercise, stress management, and sodium restriction. Realizing that more than one agent is usually required to reach the blood pressure goal, the ADA recommends that all patients with diabetes and hypertension be treated with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB. Subsequently, agents that reduce cardiovascular risk (beta blockers, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel blockers) should be incorporated into the regimen. While ACE inhibitors and ARBs are likely equivalent in most patients with diabetes and renal disease, the ADA notes (1) in patients with type 1 diabetes, hypertension, and micro- or macroalbuminuria, an ACE inhibitor slowed progression of nephropathy; (2) an ACE inhibitor or an ARB slowed the progression to macroalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and microalbumin-uria; and (3) ARB slowed the decline in GFR in patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, macroalbuminuria, and renal insufficiency. Additional points of emphasis include the following:

ACE inhibitors are either glucose- and lipid-neutral or glucose- and lipid-beneficial and thus positively impact the cardiovascular risk profile. Calcium channel blockers, central adrenergic antagonists, and vasodilators are lipid- and glucose-neutral.

Beta blockers and thiazide diuretics can increase insulin resistance and negatively impact the lipid profile; beta blockers may slightly increase the risk of developing type 2 DM. Beta blockers are safe in patients with diabetes and reduce cardiovascular events.

Sympathetic inhibitors and -adrenergic blockers may worsen orthostatic hypotension in the diabetic individual with autonomic neuropathy.

Equivalent reduction in blood pressure by different classes of agents may not translate into equivalent protection from cardiovascular and renal endpoints. Thiazides, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs positively impact cardiovascular endpoints (MI or stroke).

Serum potassium and renal function should be monitored.

Because of the high prevalence of atherosclerotic disease in individuals with type 2 DM, the possibility of renovascular hypertension should be considered when the blood pressure is not readily controlled.

Lower Extremity Complications

DM is the leading cause of nontraumatic lower extremity amputation in the United States. Foot ulcers and infections are also a major source of morbidity in individuals with DM. The reasons for the increased incidence of these disorders in DM involve the interaction of several pathogenic factors: neuropathy, abnormal foot biomechanics, PAD, and poor wound healing. The peripheral sensory neuropathy interferes with normal protective mechanisms and allows the patient to sustain major or repeated minor trauma to the foot, often without knowledge of the injury. Disordered proprioception causes abnormal weight bearing while walking and subsequent formation of callus or ulceration. Motor and sensory neuropathy lead to abnormal foot muscle mechanics and to structural changes in the foot (hammertoe, claw toe deformity, prominent metatarsal heads, Charcot joint). Autonomic neuropathy results in anhidrosis and altered superficial blood flow in the foot, which promote drying of the skin and fissure formation. PAD and poor wound healing impede resolution of minor breaks in the skin, allowing them to enlarge and to become infected.

Approximately 15% of individuals with type 2 DM develop a foot ulcer (great toe or MTP areas are most common), and a significant subset will ultimately undergo amputation (14每24% risk with that ulcer or subsequent ulceration). Risk factors for foot ulcers or amputation include: male sex, diabetes >10 years' duration, peripheral neuropathy, abnormal structure of foot (bony abnormalities, callus, thickened nails), peripheral arterial disease, smoking, history of previous ulcer or amputation, and poor glycemic control. Large calluses are often precursors to or overlie ulcerations.

Treatment: Lower Extremity Complications

The optimal therapy for foot ulcers and amputations is prevention through identification of high-risk patients, education of the patient, and institution of measures to prevent ulceration. High-risk patients should be identified during the routine foot examination performed on all patients with DM (see "Ongoing Aspects of Comprehensive Diabetes Care," below). Patient education should emphasize (1) careful selection of footwear, (2) daily inspection of the feet to detect early signs of poor-fitting footwear or minor trauma, (3) daily foot hygiene to keep the skin clean and moist, (4) avoidance of self-treatment of foot abnormalities and high-risk behavior (e.g., walking barefoot), and (5) prompt consultation with a health care provider if an abnormality arises. Patients at high risk for ulceration or amputation may benefit from evaluation by a foot care specialist. Interventions directed at risk factor modification include orthotic shoes and devices, callus management, nail care, and prophylactic measures to reduce increased skin pressure from abnormal bony architecture. Attention to other risk factors for vascular disease (smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension) and improved glycemic control are also important.

Despite preventive measures, foot ulceration and infection are common and represent a serious problem. Due to the multifactorial pathogenesis of lower extremity ulcers, management of these lesions is multidisciplinary and often demands expertise in orthopedics, vascular surgery, endocrinology, podiatry, and infectious diseases. The plantar surface of the foot is the most common site of ulceration. Ulcers may be primarily neuropathic (no accompanying infection) or may have surrounding cellulitis or osteomyelitis. Cellulitis without ulceration is also frequent and should be treated with antibiotics that provide broad-spectrum coverage, including anaerobes (see below).

An infected ulcer is a clinical diagnosis, since superficial culture of any ulceration will likely find multiple possible bacterial species. The infection surrounding the foot ulcer is often the result of multiple organisms (gram-positive and -negative organisms and anaerobes), and gas gangrene may develop in the absence of clostridial infection. Cultures taken from the surface of the ulcer are not helpful; a culture from the debrided ulcer base or from purulent drainage or aspiration of the wound is the most helpful. Wound depth should be determined by inspection and probing with a blunt-tipped sterile instrument. Plain radiographs of the foot should be performed to assess the possibility of osteomyelitis in chronic ulcers that have not responded to therapy. Nuclear medicine bone scans may be helpful, but overlying subcutaneous infection is often difficult to distinguish from osteomyelitis. Indium-labeled white cell studies are more useful in determining if the infection involves bony structures or only soft tissue, but they are technically demanding. MRI of the foot may be the most specific modality, although distinguishing bony destruction due to osteomyelitis from destruction secondary to Charcot arthropathy is difficult. If surgical debridement is necessary, bone biopsy and culture may provide the answer.

Osteomyelitis is best treated by a combination of prolonged antibiotics (IV, then oral) and possibly debridement of infected bone. The possible contribution of vascular insufficiency should be considered in all patients. Noninvasive blood-flow studies are often unreliable in DM, and angiography may be required, recognizing the risk of contrast-induced nephrotoxicity. Peripheral arterial bypass procedures are often effective in promoting wound healing and in decreasing the need for amputation of the ischemic limb.

A growing number of possible treatments for diabetic foot ulcers exist, but they have yet to demonstrate clear efficacy in prospective, controlled trials. A consensus statement from the ADA identified six interventions with demonstrated efficacy in diabetic foot wounds: (1) off-loading, (2) debridement, (3) wound dressings, (4) appropriate use of antibiotics, (5) revascularization, and (6) limited amputation. Off-loading is the complete avoidance of weight bearing on the ulcer, which removes the mechanical trauma that retards wound healing. Bed rest and a variety of orthotic devices or contact casting limit weight bearing on wounds or pressure points. Surgical debridement is important and effective, but clear efficacy of other modalities for wound cleaning (enzymes, soaking, whirlpools) is lacking. Dressings such as hydrocolloid dressings promote wound healing by creating a moist environment and protecting the wound. Antiseptic agents should be avoided. Topical antibiotics are of limited value. Referral for physical therapy, orthotic evaluation, and rehabilitation should occur once the infection is controlled.

Mild or non-limb-threatening infections can be treated with oral antibiotics (cephalosporin, clindamycin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and fluoroquinolones), surgical debridement of necrotic tissue, local wound care (avoidance of weight bearing over the ulcer), and close surveillance for progression of infection. More severe ulcers may require IV antibiotics as well as bed rest and local wound care. Urgent surgical debridement may be required. Strict control of glycemia should be a goal (see below). IV antibiotics should provide broad-spectrum coverage directed toward Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, gram-negative aerobes, and anaerobic bacteria. Initial antimicrobial regimens include ertapenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefotetan, ampicillin/sulbactam, linezolid, or the combination of clindamycin and a fluoroquinolone. Severe infections, or infections that do not improve after 48 h of antibiotic therapy, require expansion of antimicrobial therapy to treat methicillin-resistant S. aureus (e.g., vancomycin) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. If the infection surrounding the ulcer is not improving with IV antibiotics, reassessment of antibiotic coverage and reconsideration of the need for surgical debridement or revascularization are indicated. With clinical improvement, oral antibiotics and local wound care can be continued on an outpatient basis with close follow-up.

New information about wound biology has led to a number of new technologies (e.g., living skin equivalents and growth factors) that may prove useful, especially in neuropathic ulcers. Hyperbaric oxygen has been used, but rigorous proof of efficacy is lacking. Negative wound pressure has been shown to accelerate wound healing of plantar wounds.

Infections

Individuals with DM have a greater frequency and severity of infection. The reasons for this include incompletely defined abnormalities in cell-mediated immunity and phagocyte function associated with hyperglycemia, as well as diminished vascularization. Hyperglycemia aids the colonization and growth of a variety of organisms (Candida and other fungal species). Many common infections are more frequent and severe in the diabetic population, whereas several rare infections are seen almost exclusively in the diabetic population. Examples of this latter category include rhinocerebral mucormycosis, emphysematous infections of the gall bladder and urinary tract, and "malignant" or invasive otitis externa. Invasive otitis externa is usually secondary to P. aeruginosa infection in the soft tissue surrounding the external auditory canal, usually begins with pain and discharge, and may rapidly progress to osteomyelitis and meningitis. These infections should be sought, in particular, in patients presenting with HHS.

Pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections are all more common in the diabetic population. In general, the organisms that cause pulmonary infections are similar to those found in the nondiabetic population; however, gram-negative organisms, S. aureus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are more frequent pathogens. Urinary tract infections (either lower tract or pyelonephritis) are the result of common bacterial agents such as Escherichia coli, though several yeast species (Candida and Torulopsis glabrata) are commonly observed. Complications of urinary tract infections include emphysematous pyelonephritis and emphysematous cystitis. Bacteriuria occurs frequently in individuals with diabetic cystopathy. Susceptibility to furunculosis, superficial candidal infections, and vulvovaginitis are increased. Poor glycemic control is a common denominator in individuals with these infections. Diabetic individuals have an increased rate of colonization of S. aureus in the skinfolds and nares. Diabetic patients also have a greater risk of postoperative wound infections. Strict glycemic control reduces postoperative infections in diabetic individuals undergoing CABG and should be the goal in all diabetic patients with an infection.

Dermatologic Manifestations

The most common skin manifestations of DM are protracted wound healing and skin ulcerations. Diabetic dermopathy, sometimes termed pigmented pretibial papules, or "diabetic skin spots," begins as an erythematous area and evolves into an area of circular hyperpigmentation. These lesions result from minor mechanical trauma in the pretibial region and are more common in elderly men with DM. Bullous diseases, such as bullosa diabeticorum (shallow ulcerations or erosions in the pretibial region), are also seen. Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is a rare disorder of DM that predominantly affects young women with type 1 DM, neuropathy, and retinopathy. It usually begins in the pretibial region as an erythematous plaque or papules that gradually enlarge, darken, and develop irregular margins, with atrophic centers and central ulceration. They may be painful. Vitiligo occurs at increased frequency in individuals with type 1 diabetes. Acanthosis nigricans (hyperpigmented velvety plaques seen on the neck, axilla, or extensor surfaces) is sometimes a feature of severe insulin resistance and accompanying diabetes. Generalized or localized granuloma annulare (erythematous plaques on the extremities or trunk) and scleredema (areas of skin thickening on the back or neck at the site of previous superficial infections) are more common in the diabetic population. Lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy can occur at insulin injection sites but are now unusual with the use of human insulin. Xerosis and pruritus are common and are relieved by skin moisturizers.

Approach to the Patient: Diabetes Mellitus

DM and its complications produce a wide range of symptoms and signs; those secondary to acute hyperglycemia may occur at any stage of the disease, whereas those related to chronic complications begin to appear during the second decade of hyperglycemia. Individuals with previously undetected type 2 DM may present with chronic complications of DM at the time of diagnosis. The history and physical examination should assess for symptoms or signs of acute hyperglycemia and should screen for the chronic complications and conditions associated with DM.

History

A complete medical history should be obtained with special emphasis on DM-relevant aspects such as weight, family history of DM and its complications, risk factors for cardiovascular disease, exercise, smoking, and ethanol use. Symptoms of hyperglycemia include polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, fatigue, weakness, blurry vision, frequent superficial infections (vaginitis, fungal skin infections), and slow healing of skin lesions after minor trauma. Metabolic derangements relate mostly to hyperglycemia (osmotic diuresis) and to the catabolic state of the patient (urinary loss of glucose and calories, muscle breakdown due to protein degradation and decreased protein synthesis). Blurred vision results from changes in the water content of the lens and resolves as the hyperglycemia is controlled.

In a patient with established DM, the initial assessment should also include special emphasis on prior diabetes care, including the type of therapy, prior A1C levels, self-monitoring blood glucose results, frequency of hypoglycemia, presence of DM-specific complications, and assessment of the patient's knowledge about diabetes, exercise, and nutrition. The chronic complications may afflict several organ systems, and an individual patient may exhibit some, all, or none of the symptoms related to the complications of DM (see above). In addition, the presence of DM-related comorbidities should be sought (cardiovascular disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia).

Physical Examination

In addition to a complete physical examination, special attention should be given to DM-relevant aspects such as weight or BMI, retinal examination, orthostatic blood pressure, foot examination, peripheral pulses, and insulin injection sites. Blood pressure >130/80 mmHg is considered hypertension in individuals with diabetes. Careful examination of the lower extremities should seek evidence of peripheral arterial disease (pedal pulses), peripheral neuropathy, calluses, superficial fungal infections, nail disease, ankle reflexes, and foot deformities (such as hammertoes or claw toes and Charcot foot) in order to identify sites of potential skin ulceration. Vibratory sensation (128-MHz tuning fork at the base of the great toe), the ability to sense touch with a monofilament (5.07, 10-g monofilament), pinprick sensation, testing for ankle reflexes, and vibration perception threshold (using a biothesiometer) are used to detect moderately advanced diabetic neuropathy. Since periodontal disease is more frequent in DM, the teeth and gums should also be examined.

Classification of DM in an Individual Patient

The etiology of diabetes in an individual with new-onset disease can usually be assigned on the basis of clinical criteria. Individuals with type 1 DM tend to have the following characteristics: (1) onset of disease prior to age 30 years; (2) lean body habitus; (3) requirement of insulin as the initial therapy; (4) propensity to develop ketoacidosis; and (5) an increased risk of other autoimmune disorders such as autoimmune thyroid disease, adrenal insufficiency, pernicious anemia, celiac disease, and vitiligo. In contrast, individuals with type 2 DM often exhibit the following features: (1) develop diabetes after the age of 30 years; (2) are usually obese (80% are obese, but elderly individuals may be lean); (3) may not require insulin therapy initially; and (4) may have associated conditions such as insulin resistance, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, or PCOS. In type 2 DM, insulin resistance is often associated with abdominal obesity (as opposed to hip and thigh obesity) and hypertriglyceridemia. Although most individuals diagnosed with type 2 DM are older, the age of diagnosis is declining, and there is a marked increase among overweight children and adolescents. Some individuals with phenotypic type 2 DM present with DKA but lack autoimmune markers and may be later treated with oral glucose-lowering agents rather than insulin (this clinical picture is sometimes referred to as ketosis-prone type 2 DM). On the other hand, some individuals (5每10%) with the phenotypic appearance of type 2 DM do not have absolute insulin deficiency but have autoimmune markers (ICA, GAD autoantibodies) suggestive of type 1 DM (termed latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult). Such individuals are more likely to be <50 years of age, have a normal BMI, and have a personal or family history of other autoimmune disease. They are much more likely to require insulin treatment within 5 years. Monogenic forms of diabetes (discussed above) should be considered in those with diabetes onset <30 years of age, an autosomal pattern of diabetes inheritance, and the lack of nearly complete insulin deficiency. Despite recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of diabetes, it remains difficult to categorize some patients unequivocally. Individuals who deviate from the clinical profile of type 1 and type 2 DM, or who have other associated defects such as deafness, pancreatic exocrine disease, and other endocrine disorders, should be classified accordingly (Table 344-1).

Laboratory Assessment

The laboratory assessment should first determine whether the patient meets the diagnostic criteria for DM (Table 344-2) and then assess the degree of glycemic control (A1C, discussed below). In addition to the standard laboratory evaluation, the patient should be screened for DM-associated conditions (e.g., microalbuminuria, dyslipid-emia, thyroid dysfunction). Individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease should be screened for asymptomatic CHD by appropriate cardiac stress testing, when indicated.

The classification of the type of DM may be facilitated by laboratory assessments. Serum insulin or C-peptide measurements do not always distinguish type 1 from type 2 DM, but a low C-peptide level confirms a patient's need for insulin. Many individuals with new-onset type 1 DM retain some C-peptide production. Measurement of islet cell antibodies at the time of diabetes onset may be useful if the type of DM is not clear based on the characteristics described above.
 
Long-Term Treatment

Overall Principles

The goals of therapy for type 1 or type 2 DM are to (1) eliminate symptoms related to hyperglycemia, (2) reduce or eliminate the long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications of DM, and (3) allow the patient to achieve as normal a lifestyle as possible. To reach these goals, the physician should identify a target level of glycemic control for each patient, provide the patient with the educational and pharmacologic resources necessary to reach this level, and monitor/treat DM-related complications. Symptoms of diabetes usually resolve when the plasma glucose is <11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), and thus most DM treatment focuses on achieving the second and third goals. The treatment goals for patients with diabetes are summarized in Table 344-8.

The care of an individual with either type 1 or type 2 DM requires a multidisciplinary team. Central to the success of this team are the patient's participation, input, and enthusiasm, all of which are essential for optimal diabetes management. Members of the health care team include the primary care provider and/or the endocrinologist or diabetologist, a certified diabetes educator, and a nutritionist. In addition, when the complications of DM arise, subspecialists (including neurologists, nephrologists, vascular surgeons, cardiologists, ophthalmologists, and podiatrists) with experience in DM-related complications are essential.

A number of names are sometimes applied to different approaches to diabetes care, such as intensive insulin therapy, intensive glycemic control, and "tight control." The current chapter, and other sources, use the term comprehensive diabetes care to emphasize the fact that optimal diabetes therapy involves more than plasma glucose management. Though glycemic control is central to optimal diabetes therapy, comprehensive diabetes care of both type 1 and type 2 DM should also detect and manage DM-specific complications and modify risk factors for DM-associated diseases. In addition to the physical aspects of DM, social, family, financial, cultural, and employment-related issues may impact diabetes care. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF), recognizing that resources available for diabetes care varies widely throughout the world, has issued guidelines for standard care (a well-developed service base and with health care funding systems consuming a significant part of their national wealth), minimal care (health care settings with very limited resources), and comprehensive care (health care settings with considerable resources). This chapter provides guidance for this comprehensive level of diabetes care.

Patient Education About DM, Nutrition, and Exercise

The patient with type 1 or type 2 DM should receive education about nutrition, exercise, care of diabetes during illness, and medications to lower the plasma glucose. Along with improved compliance, patient education allows individuals with DM to assume greater responsibility for their care. Patient education should be viewed as a continuing process with regular visits for reinforcement; it should not be a process that is completed after one or two visits to a nurse educator or nutritionist. The ADA refers to education about the individualized management plan for the patient as diabetes self-management education (DSME). More frequent contact between the patient and the diabetes management team (electronic, telephone, etc.) improves glycemic control.

Diabetes Education

The diabetes educator is a health care professional (nurse, dietician, or pharmacist) with specialized patient education skills who is certified in diabetes education (e.g., American Association of Diabetes Educators). Education topics important for optimal diabetes care include self-monitoring of blood glucose; urine ketone monitoring (type 1 DM); insulin administration; guidelines for diabetes management during illnesses; prevention and management of hypoglycemia (Chap. 345); foot and skin care; diabetes management before, during, and after exercise; and risk factor每modifying activities.

Nutrition

Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is a term used by the ADA to describe the optimal coordination of caloric intake with other aspects of diabetes therapy (insulin, exercise, weight loss). Primary prevention measures of MNT are directed at preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 DM in high-risk individuals (obese or with prediabetes) by promoting weight reduction. Medical treatment of obesity is a rapidly evolving area and is discussed in Chap. 78. Secondary prevention measures of MNT are directed at preventing or delaying diabetes-related complications in diabetic individuals by improving glycemic control. Tertiary prevention measures of MNT are directed at managing diabetes-related complications (cardiovascular disease, nephropathy) in diabetic individuals. For example, in individuals with diabetes and chronic kidney disease, protein intake should be limited to 0.8 g/kg of body weight per day. MNT in patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease should incorporate dietary principles used in nondiabetic patients with cardiovascular disease. While the recommendations for all three types of MNT overlap, this chapter emphasizes secondary prevention measures of MNT. Pharmacologic approaches that facilitate weight loss and bariatric surgery should be considered in selected patients (Chap. 78).

In general, the components of optimal MNT are similar for individuals with type 1 or type 2 DM and similar to those for the general population (fruits, vegetables, fiber-containing foods, and low fat; Table 344-9). MNT education is an important component of comprehensive diabetes care and should be reinforced by regular patient education. Historically, nutrition education imposed restrictive, complicated regimens on the patient. Current practices have greatly changed, though many patients and health care providers still view the diabetic diet as monolithic and static. For example, MNT now includes foods with sucrose and seeks to modify other risk factors such as hyperlipidemia and hypertension rather than focusing exclusively on weight loss in individuals with type 2 DM. The glycemic index is an estimate of the postprandial rise in the blood glucose when a certain amount of that food is consumed. Consumption of foods with a low glycemic index appears to reduce postprandial glucose excursions and improve glycemic control. Reduced calorie and nonnutritive sweeteners are useful. Currently, evidence does not support supplementation of the diet with vitamins, antioxidants (vitamin C and E), or micronutrients (chromium) in patients with diabetes.

The goal of MNT in the individual with type 1 DM is to coordinate and match the caloric intake, both temporally and quantitatively, with the appropriate amount of insulin. MNT in type 1 DM and self-monitoring of blood glucose must be integrated to define the optimal insulin regimen. The ADA encourages patients and providers to utilize carbohydrate counting or exchange systems to estimate the nutrient content of a meal or snack. Based on the patient's estimate of the carbohydrate content of a meal, an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio determines the bolus insulin dose for a meal or snack. MNT must be flexible enough to allow for exercise, and the insulin regimen must allow for deviations in caloric intake. An important component of MNT in type 1 DM is to minimize the weight gain often associated with intensive diabetes management.

The goals of MNT in type 2 DM should focus on weight loss and address the greatly increased prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity) and disease in this population. The majority of these individuals are obese, and weight loss is strongly encouraged and should remain an important goal. Hypocaloric diets and modest weight loss (5每7%) often result in rapid and dramatic glucose lowering in individuals with new-onset type 2 DM. Nevertheless, numerous studies document that long-term weight loss is uncommon. MNT for type 2 DM should emphasize modest caloric reduction (low-carbohydrate or low-fat), reduced fat intake, and increased physical activity. Increased consumption of soluble, dietary fiber may improve glycemic control in individuals with type 2 DM. Weight loss and exercise improve insulin resistance.

Exercise

Exercise has multiple positive benefits including cardiovascular risk reduction, reduced blood pressure, maintenance of muscle mass, reduction in body fat, and weight loss. For individuals with type 1 or type 2 DM, exercise is also useful for lowering plasma glucose (during and following exercise) and increasing insulin sensitivity. In patients with diabetes, the ADA recommends 150 min/week (distributed over at least 3 days) of moderate aerobic physical activity. The exercise regimen should also include resistance training.

Despite its benefits, exercise presents challenges for individuals with DM because they lack the normal glucoregulatory mechanisms (normally, insulin falls and glucagon rises during exercise). Skeletal muscle is a major site for metabolic fuel consumption in the resting state, and the increased muscle activity during vigorous, aerobic exercise greatly increases fuel requirements. Individuals with type 1 DM are prone to either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia during exercise, depending on the pre-exercise plasma glucose, the circulating insulin level, and the level of exercise-induced catecholamines. If the insulin level is too low, the rise in catecholamines may increase the plasma glucose excessively, promote ketone body formation, and possibly lead to ketoacidosis. Conversely, if the circulating insulin level is excessive, this relative hyperinsulinemia may reduce hepatic glucose production (decreased glycogenolysis, decreased gluconeogenesis) and increase glucose entry into muscle, leading to hypoglycemia.

To avoid exercise-related hyper- or hypoglycemia, individuals with type 1 DM should (1) monitor blood glucose before, during, and after exercise; (2) delay exercise if blood glucose is >14 mmol/L (250 mg/dL) and ketones are present; (3) if the blood glucose is <5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL), ingest carbohydrate before exercising; (3) monitor glucose during exercise and ingest carbohydrate to prevent hypoglycemia; (4) decrease insulin doses (based on previous experience) before exercise and inject insulin into a non-exercising area; and (5) learn individual glucose responses to different types of exercise and increase food intake for up to 24 h after exercise, depending on intensity and duration of exercise. In individuals with type 2 DM, exercise-related hypoglycemia is less common but can occur in individuals taking either insulin or insulin secretagogues.

Because asymptomatic cardiovascular disease appears at a younger age in both type 1 and type 2 DM, formal exercise tolerance testing may be warranted in diabetic individuals with any of the following: age >35 years, diabetes duration >15 years (type 1 DM) or >10 years (type 2 DM), microvascular complications of DM (retinopathy, microalbuminuria, or nephropathy), PAD, other risk factors of CHD, or autonomic neuropathy. Untreated proliferative retinopathy is a relative contraindication to vigorous exercise, as this may lead to vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment.

Monitoring the Level of Glycemic Control

Optimal monitoring of glycemic control involves plasma glucose measurements by the patient and an assessment of long-term control by the physician (measurement of hemoglobin A1C and review of the patient's self-measurements of plasma glucose). These measurements are complementary: the patient's measurements provide a picture of short-term glycemic control, whereas the A1C reflects average glycemic control over the previous 2每3 months.

Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose

Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is the standard of care in diabetes management and allows the patient to monitor his or her blood glucose at any time. In SMBG, a small drop of blood and an easily detectable enzymatic reaction allow measurement of the capillary plasma glucose. Many glucose monitors can rapidly and accurately measure glucose (calibrated to provide plasma glucose value even though blood glucose is measured) in small amounts of blood (3每10 L) obtained from the fingertip; alternative testing sites (e.g., forearm) are less reliable, especially when the blood glucose is changing rapidly (postprandially). A large number of blood glucose monitors are available, and the certified diabetes educator is critical in helping the patient select the optimal device and learn to use it properly. By combining glucose measurements with diet history, medication changes, and exercise history, the diabetes management team and patient can improve the treatment program.

The frequency of SMBG measurements must be individualized and adapted to address the goals of diabetes care. Individuals with type 1 DM or individuals with type 2 DM taking multiple insulin injections each day should routinely measure their plasma glucose three or more times per day to estimate and select mealtime boluses of short-acting insulin and to modify long-acting insulin doses. Most individuals with type 2 DM require less frequent monitoring, though the optimal frequency of SMBG has not been clearly defined. Individuals with type 2 DM who are taking insulin should utilize SMBG more frequently than those on oral agents. Individuals with type 2 DM who are on oral medications should utilize SMBG as a means of assessing the efficacy of their medication and the impact of diet. Since plasma glucose levels fluctuate less in these individuals, one to two SMBG measurements per day (or fewer in patients who are on oral agents or are diet-controlled) may be sufficient. Most measurements in individuals with type 1 or type 2 DM should be performed prior to a meal and supplemented with postprandial measurements to assist in reaching postprandial glucose targets (Table 344-8).

Devices for continuous blood glucose monitoring (CGM) have been approved by the FDA, and others are in various stages of development. These devices do not replace the need for traditional glucose measurements. This rapidly evolving technology requires substantial expertise on the part of the diabetes management team and the patient. Current continuous glucose-monitoring systems measure the glucose in interstitial fluid, which is in equilibrium with the blood glucose. These devices provide useful short-term information about the patterns of glucose changes as well as an enhanced ability to detect hypoglycemic episodes. Alarms notify the patient if the blood glucose falls into the hypoglycemic range. Clinical experience with these devices is rapidly growing, and they are most useful in individuals with hypoglycemia unawareness, frequent hypoglycemia, or those who have not achieved glycemic targets despite major efforts. The utility of CGM in the ICU setting remains to be determined.

Ketones are an indicator of early diabetic ketoacidosis and should be measured in individuals with type 1 DM when the plasma glucose is consistently >16.7 mmol/L (300 mg/dL) during a concurrent illness or with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Blood measurement of -hydroxybutyrate is preferred over urine testing with nitroprusside-based assays that measure only acetoacetate and acetone.

Assessment of Long-Term Glycemic Control

Measurement of glycated hemoglobin is the standard method for assessing long-term glycemic control. When plasma glucose is consistently elevated, there is an increase in nonenzymatic glycation of hemoglobin; this alteration reflects the glycemic history over the previous 2每3 months, since erythrocytes have an average life span of 120 days (glycemic level in the preceding month contributes about 50% to the A1C value). There are numerous laboratory methods for measuring the various forms of glycated hemoglobin, and these have significant interassay variations; assays that are calibrated against the DCCT A1C assay are essential. Depending on the assay methodology, hemoglobinopathies, anemias, reticulocytosis, transfusions, and uremia may interfere with the A1C result. Measurement of A1C at the "point of care" allows for more rapid feedback and may therefore assist in adjustment of therapy.

A1C should be measured in all individuals with DM during their initial evaluation and as part of their comprehensive diabetes care. As the primary predictor of long-term complications of DM, the A1C should mirror, to a certain extent, the short-term measurements of SMBG. These two measurements are complementary in that recent intercurrent illnesses may impact the SMBG measurements but not the A1C. Likewise, postprandial and nocturnal hyperglycemia may not be detected by the SMBG of fasting and preprandial capillary plasma glucose but will be reflected in the A1C. In standardized assays, the A1C approximates the following mean plasma glucose values: an A1C of 6% = 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL), 7% = 8.6 mmol/L (154 mg/dL), 8% = 10.2 mmol/L (183 mg/dL), 9% = 11.8 mmol/L (212 mg/dL), 10% = 13.4 mmol/L (240 mg/dL), 11% = 14.9 mmol/L (269 mg/dL), and 12% = 16.5 mmol/L (298 mg/dL). In patients achieving their glycemic goal, the ADA recommends measurement of the A1C at least twice per year. More frequent testing (every 3 months) is warranted when glycemic control is inadequate or when therapy has changed. The degree of glycation of other proteins, such as albumin, can be used as an alternative indicator of glycemic control when the A1C is inaccurate (hemolytic anemia, hemoglobinopathies). The fructosamine assay (measuring glycated albumin) reflects the glycemic status over the prior 2 weeks. Alternative assays of glycemic control should not be routinely used since studies demonstrating that it accurately predicts the complications of DM are lacking.

Treatment: Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus


Establishment of Target Level of Glycemic Control

Because the complications of DM are related to glycemic control, normoglycemia or near-normoglycemia is the desired, but often elusive, goal for most patients. However, normalization of the plasma glucose for long periods of time is extremely difficult, as demonstrated by the DCCT. Regardless of the level of hyperglycemia, improvement in glycemic control will lower the risk of diabetes complications (Fig. 344-8).

The target for glycemic control (as reflected by the A1C) must be individualized, and the goals of therapy should be developed in consultation with the patient after considering a number of medical, social, and lifestyle issues. Some important factors to consider include the patient's age, ability to understand and implement a complex treatment regimen, presence and severity of complications of diabetes, ability to recognize hypoglycemic symptoms, presence of other medical conditions or treatments that might alter the response to therapy, lifestyle and occupation (e.g., possible consequences of experiencing hypoglycemia on the job), and level of support available from family and friends.

The ADA suggests that the glycemic goal is to achieve an A1C as close to normal as possible without significant hypoglycemia. In general, the target A1C should be <7% (Table 344-8) with a more stringent target for some patients. A higher A1C goal may be appropriate for the very young or old or in individuals with limited life span or comorbid conditions. The major consideration is the frequency and severity of hypoglycemia, since this becomes more common with a more stringent A1C goal. More stringent glycemic control (A1C of 6% or less) is not beneficial, and may be deterimental, in type 2 DM and a high risk of CV disease.

Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus

General Aspects

The ADA recommendations for fasting and bedtime glycemic goals and A1C targets are summarized in Table 344-8. The goal is to design and implement insulin regimens that mimic physiologic insulin secretion. Because individuals with type 1 DM partially or completely lack endogenous insulin production, administration of basal insulin is essential for regulating glycogen breakdown, gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, and ketogenesis. Likewise, insulin replacement for meals should be appropriate for the carbohydrate intake and promote normal glucose utilization and storage.

Intensive Management

Intensive diabetes management has the goal of achieving euglycemia or near-normal glycemia. This approach requires multiple resources, including thorough and continuing patient education, comprehensive recording of plasma glucose measurements and nutrition intake by the patient, and a variable insulin regimen that matches glucose intake and insulin dose. Insulin regimens usually include multiple-component insulin regimens, multiple daily injections (MDI), or insulin infusion devices (each discussed below).

The benefits of intensive diabetes management and improved glycemic control include a reduction in the microvascular complications of DM and a reduction in the macrovascular complications of DM, which persists after a period of near-normoglycemia. From a psychological standpoint, the patient experiences greater control over his or her diabetes and often notes an improved sense of well-being, greater flexibility in the timing and content of meals, and the capability to alter insulin dosing with exercise. In addition, intensive diabetes management prior to and during pregnancy reduces the risk of fetal malformations and morbidity. Intensive diabetes management is strongly encouraged in newly diagnosed patients with type 1 DM because it may prolong the period of C-peptide production, which may result in better glycemic control and a reduced risk of serious hypoglycemia.

Although intensive management confers impressive benefits, it is also accompanied by significant personal and financial costs and is therefore not appropriate for all individuals.

Insulin Preparations

Current insulin preparations are generated by recombinant DNA technology and consist of the amino acid sequence of human insulin or variations thereof. In the United States, most insulin is formulated as U-100 (100 units/mL). Regular insulin formulated as U-500 (500 units/mL) is available and sometimes useful in patients with severe insulin resistance. Human insulin has been formulated with distinctive pharmacokinetics or genetically modified to more closely mimic physiologic insulin secretion. Insulins can be classified as short-acting or long-acting (Table 344-10). For example, one short-acting insulin formulation, insulin lispro, is an insulin analogue in which the 28th and 29th amino acids (lysine and proline) on the insulin B chain have been reversed by recombinant DNA technology. Insulin aspart and insulin glulisine are other genetically modified insulin analogues with properties similar to lispro. These insulin analogues have full biologic activity but less tendency for self-aggregation, resulting in more rapid absorption and onset of action and a shorter duration of action. These characteristics are particularly advantageous for allowing entrainment of insulin injection and action to rising plasma glucose levels following meals. The shorter duration of action also appears to be associated with a decreased number of hypoglycemic episodes, primarily because the decay of insulin action corresponds to the decline in plasma glucose after a meal. Thus, insulin aspart, lispro, or glulisine is preferred over regular insulin for prandial coverage. Insulin glargine is a long-acting biosynthetic human insulin that differs from normal insulin in that asparagine is replaced by glycine at amino acid 21, and two arginine residues are added to the C terminus of the B chain. Compared to NPH insulin, the onset of insulin glargine action is later, the duration of action is longer (24 h), and there is a less pronounced peak. A lower incidence of hypoglycemia, especially at night, has been reported with insulin glargine when compared to NPH insulin. The possible association between glargine and increased cancer risk is being investigated (FDA review underway) and is controversial. Insulin detemir has a fatty acid side chain that prolongs its action by slowing absorption and catabolism. Twice-daily injections of glargine of detemir are sometimes required to provide 24-h coverage. Regular and NPH insulin have the native insulin amino acid sequence.

Basal insulin requirements are provided by long-acting (NPH insulin, insulin glargine, or insulin detemir) insulin formulations. These are usually prescribed with short-acting insulin in an attempt to mimic physiologic insulin release with meals. Although mixing of NPH and short-acting insulin formulations is common practice, this mixing may alter the insulin absorption profile (especially the short-acting insulins). For example, lispro absorption is delayed by mixing with NPH. The alteration in insulin absorption when the patient mixes different insulin formulations should not discourage mixing insulins. However, the following guidelines should be followed: (1) Mix the different insulin formulations in the syringe immediately before injection (inject within 2 min after mixing); (2) do not store insulin as a mixture; (3) follow the same routine in terms of insulin mixing and administration to standardize the physiologic response to injected insulin; and (4) do not mix insulin glargine or detemir with other insulins. The miscibility of human regular and NPH insulin allows for the production of combination insulins that contain 70% NPH and 30% regular (70/30), or equal mixtures of NPH and regular (50/50). Other combination insulin formulations are insulin aspart (70/30) and insulin lispro (75/25 and 50/50). By including the insulin analogue mixed with protamine, these combinations have a short-acting and long-acting profile (Table 344-10). While more convenient for the patient (only two injections/day), combination insulin formulations do not allow independent adjustment of short-acting and long-acting activity. Several insulin formulations are available as insulin "pens," which may be more convenient for some patients. Insulin delivery by inhalation is no longer available but remains under investigation.

Insulin Regimens

Representations of the various insulin regimens that may be utilized in type 1 DM are illustrated in Fig. 344-12. Although the insulin profiles are depicted as "smooth," symmetric curves, there is considerable patient-to-patient variation in the peak and duration. In all regimens, long-acting insulins (NPH, glargine, or detemir) supply basal insulin, whereas regular, insulin aspart, glulisine, or lispro insulin provides prandial insulin. Short-acting insulin analogues should be injected just before (<20 min) or just after a meal; regular insulin is given 30每45 min prior to a meal.

A shortcoming of current insulin regimens is that injected insulin immediately enters the systemic circulation, whereas endogenous insulin is secreted into the portal venous system. Thus, exogenous insulin administration exposes the liver to subphysiologic insulin levels. No insulin regimen reproduces the precise insulin secretory pattern of the pancreatic islet. However, the most physiologic regimens entail more frequent insulin injections, greater reliance on short-acting insulin, and more frequent capillary plasma glucose measurements. In general, individuals with type 1 DM require 0.5每1 U/kg per day of insulin divided into multiple doses, with 50% of the insulin given as basal insulin.

Multiple-component insulin regimens refer to the combination of basal insulin and bolus insulin (preprandial short-acting insulin). The timing and dose of short-acting, preprandial insulin are altered to accommodate the SMBG results, anticipated food intake, and physical activity. Such regimens offer the patient with type 1 diabetes more flexibility in terms of lifestyle and the best chance for achieving near normoglycemia. One such regimen, shown in Fig. 344-12B, consists of basal insulin with glargine or detemir and preprandial lispro, glulisine, or insulin aspart. The insulin aspart, glulisine, or lispro dose is based on individualized algorithms that integrate the preprandial glucose and the anticipated carbohydrate intake. To determine the meal component of the preprandial insulin dose, the patient uses an insulin-to- carbohydrate ratio (a common ratio for type 1 DM is 1每1.5 units/10 g of carbohydrate, but this must be determined for each individual). To this insulin dose is added the supplemental or correcting insulin based on the preprandial blood glucose [one formula uses 1 unit of insulin for every 2.7 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) over the preprandial glucose target; another formula uses (body weight in kg) x (blood glucose 每 desired glucose in mg/dL)/1700]. An alternative multiple-component insulin regimen consists of bedtime NPH insulin, a small dose of NPH insulin at breakfast (20每30% of bedtime dose), and preprandial short-acting insulin. Other variations of this regimen are in use but have the disadvantage that NPH has a significant peak, making hypoglycemia more common. Frequent SMBG (more than three times per day) is absolutely essential for these types of insulin regimens.

One commonly used regimen consists of twice-daily injections of NPH mixed with a short-acting insulin before the morning and evening meals (Fig. 344-12A). Such regimens usually prescribe two-thirds of the total daily insulin dose in the morning (with about two-thirds given as long-acting insulin and one-third as short-acting) and one-third before the evening meal (with approximately one-half given as long-acting insulin and one-half as short-acting). The drawback to such a regimen is that it enforces a rigid schedule on the patient, in terms of daily activity and the content and timing of meals. Although it is simple and effective at avoiding severe hyperglycemia, it does not generate near-normal glycemic control in individuals with type 1 DM. Moreover, if the patient's meal pattern or content varies or if physical activity is increased, hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia may result. Moving the long-acting insulin from before the evening meal to bedtime may avoid nocturnal hypoglycemia and provide more insulin as glucose levels rise in the early morning (so-called dawn phenomenon). The insulin dose in such regimens should be adjusted based on SMBG results with the following general assumptions: (1) the fasting glucose is primarily determined by the prior evening long-acting insulin; (2) the pre-lunch glucose is a function of the morning short-acting insulin; (3) the pre-supper glucose is a function of the morning long-acting insulin; and (4) the bedtime glucose is a function of the pre-supper, short-acting insulin. This is not an optimal regimen for the patient with type 1 DM, but is sometimes used for patients with type 2 diabetes.

Continuous SC insulin infusion (CSII) is a very effective insulin regimen for the patient with type 1 diabetes (Fig. 344-12C). To the basal insulin infusion, a preprandial insulin ("bolus") is delivered by the insulin infusion device based on instructions from the patient, who uses an individualized algorithm incorporating the preprandial plasma glucose and anticipated carbohydrate intake (see above). These sophisticated insulin infusion devices can accurately deliver small doses of insulin (microliters per hour) and have several advantages: (1) multiple basal infusion rates can be programmed to accommodate nocturnal versus daytime basal insulin requirement, (2) basal infusion rates can be altered during periods of exercise, (3) different waveforms of insulin infusion with meal-related bolus allow better matching of insulin depending on meal composition, and (4) programmed algorithms consider prior insulin administration and blood glucose values in calculating the insulin dose. These devices require instruction by a health professional with considerable experience with insulin infusion devices and very frequent patient interactions with the diabetes management team. Insulin infusion devices present unique challenges, such as infection at the infusion site, unexplained hyperglycemia because the infusion set becomes obstructed, or diabetic ketoacidosis if the pump becomes disconnected. Since most physicians use lispro, glulisine, or insulin aspart in CSII, the extremely short half-life of these insulins quickly lead to insulin deficiency if the delivery system is interrupted. Essential to the safe use of infusion devices is thorough patient education about pump function and frequent SMBG. Efforts to create a closed-loop system in which data from continuous glucose measurement regulates the insulin infusion rate continue.

Other Agents that Improve Glucose Control

The role of amylin, a 37-amino-acid peptide co-secreted with insulin from pancreatic beta cells, in normal glucose homeostasis is uncertain. However, based on the rationale that patients who are insulin deficient are also amylin deficient, an analogue of amylin (pramlintide) was created and found to reduce postprandial glycemic excursions in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients taking insulin. Pramlintide injected just before a meal slows gastric emptying and suppresses glucagon but does not alter insulin levels. Pramlintide is approved for insulin-treated patients with type 1 and type 2 DM. Addition of pramlintide produces a modest reduction in the A1C and seems to dampen meal-related glucose excursions. In type 1 diabetes, pramlintide is started as a 15-g SC injection before each meal and titrated up to a maximum of 30每60 g as tolerated. In type 2 DM, pramlintide is started as a 60-g SC injection before each meal and may be titrated up to a maximum of 120 g. The major side effects are nausea and vomiting, and dose escalations should be slow to limit these side effects. Because pramlintide slows gastric emptying, it may influence absorption of other medications and should not be used in combination with other drugs that slow GI motility. The short-acting insulin given before the meal should initially be reduced to avoid hypoglycemia and then titrated as the effects of the pramlintide become evident. -Glucosidase inhibitors are another type of agent that is sometimes used in conjunction in patients with type 1 DM.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

General Aspects

The goals of therapy for type 2 DM are similar to those in type 1. While glycemic control tends to dominate the management of type 1 DM, the care of individuals with type 2 DM must also include attention to the treatment of conditions associated with type 2 DM (obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease) and detection/management of DM-related complications (Fig. 344-13). DM-specific complications may be present in up to 20每50% of individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 DM. Reduction in cardiovascular risk is of paramount importance as this is the leading cause of mortality in these individuals. Efforts to achieve blood pressure and lipid goals (Table 344-8) should begin in concert with glucose-lowering interventions.

Figure 344-13

 
 
 
Essential elements in comprehensive diabetes care of type 2 diabetes.
 
 

Type 2 diabetes management should begin with MNT (discussed above). An exercise regimen to increase insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss should also be instituted. Pharmacologic approaches to the management of type 2 DM include oral glucose-lowering agents, insulin, and other agents that improve glucose control; most physicians and patients prefer oral glucose-lowering agents as the initial choice (discussed below) after review of various medications. Any therapy that improves glycemic control reduces "glucose toxicity" to the islet cells and improves endogenous insulin secretion. However, type 2 DM is a progressive disorder and ultimately requires multiple therapeutic agents and often insulin.

Glucose-Lowering Agents

Advances in the therapy of type 2 DM have generated oral glucose-lowering agents that target different pathophysiologic processes in type 2 DM. Based on their mechanisms of action, glucose-lowering agents are subdivided into agents that increase insulin secretion, reduce glucose production, increase insulin sensitivity, and enhance GLP-1 action (Table 344-11). Glucose-lowering agents other than insulin (with the exception of amylin analogue and -glucosidase inhibitors) are ineffective in type 1 DM and should not be used for glucose management of severely ill individuals with type 2 DM. Insulin is sometimes the initial glucose-lowering agent in type 2 diabetes.

Biguanides

Metformin, representative of this class of agents, reduces hepatic glucose production and improves peripheral glucose utilization slightly (Table 344-11). Metformin activates AMP-dependent protein kinase and enters cells through organic cation transporters (polymorphisms of these may influence the response to metformin). Metformin reduces fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels, improves the lipid profile, and promotes modest weight loss. The initial starting dose of 500 mg once or twice a day can be increased to 1000 mg bid. An extended-release form is available and may have fewer gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhea, anorexia, nausea, metallic taste). Because of its relatively slow onset of action and gastrointestinal symptoms with higher doses, the dose should be escalated every 2每3 weeks based on SMBG measurements. Metformin is effective as monotherapy and can be used in combination with other oral agents or with insulin. The major toxicity of metformin, lactic acidosis is very rare and can be prevented by careful patient selection. Vitamin B12 levels are 30% lower during metformin treatment. Metformin should not be used in patients with renal insufficiency [GFR < 60 mL/min], any form of acidosis, CHF, liver disease, or severe hypoxemia. Metformin should be discontinued in patients who are seriously ill, in patients who can take nothing orally, and in those receiving radiographic contrast material. Insulin should be used until metformin can be restarted.

Insulin Secretagogues〞Agents that Affect the ATP-Sensitive K+ Channel

Insulin secretagogues stimulate insulin secretion by interacting with the ATP-sensitive potassium channel on the beta cell (Fig. 344-4). These drugs are most effective in individuals with type 2 DM of relatively recent onset (<5 years), who have residual endogenous insulin production. First-generation sulfonylureas (chlorpropamide, tolazamide, tolbutamide; not shown in Table 344-12) have a longer half-life, a greater incidence of hypoglycemia, more frequent drug interactions, and are now rarely used. Second-generation sulfonylureas have a more rapid onset of action and better coverage of the postprandial glucose rise, but the shorter half-life of some agents may require more than once-a-day dosing (Table 344-12). Sulfonylureas reduce both fasting and postprandial glucose and should be initiated at low doses and increased at 1- to 2-week intervals based on SMBG. In general, sulfonylureas increase insulin acutely and thus should be taken shortly before a meal; with chronic therapy, though, the insulin release is more sustained. Glimepiride and glipizide can be given in a single daily dose and are preferred over glyburide. Repaglinide and nateglinide are not sulfonylureas but also interact with the ATP-sensitive potassium channel. Because of their short half-life, these agents are given with each meal or immediately before to reduce meal-related glucose excursions.

These insulin secretagogues are generally well tolerated. These agents, especially the longer acting ones, have the potential to cause profound and persistent hypoglycemia, especially in elderly individuals. Hypoglycemia is usually related to delayed meals, increased physical activity, alcohol intake, or renal insufficiency. Individuals who ingest an overdose of some agents develop prolonged and serious hypoglycemia and should be monitored closely in the hospital (Chap. 345). Most sulfonylureas are metabolized in the liver to compounds (some of which are active) that are cleared by the kidney. Thus, their use in individuals with significant hepatic or renal dysfunction is not advisable. Weight gain, a common side effect of sulfonylurea therapy, results from the increased insulin levels and improvement in glycemic control. Some sulfonylureas have significant drug interactions with alcohol and some medications including warfarin, aspirin, ketoconazole, -glucosidase inhibitors, and fluconazole. A related isoform of ATP-sensitive potassium channels is present in the myocardium and the brain. All of these agents except glyburide have a low affinity for this isoform. Despite concerns that this agent might affect the myocardial response to ischemia and observational studies suggesting that sulfonylureas increase cardiovascular risk, studies have not shown an increased cardiac mortality with glyburide.

Insulin Secretagogues〞Agents that Enhance Glp-1 Receptor Signaling

"Incretins" amplify glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Fig. 344-4). Agents that either act as a GLP-1 agonist or enhance endogenous GLP-1 activity are approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (Table 344-12). Agents in this class do not cause hypoglycemia because of the glucose-dependent nature of incretin-stimulated insulin secretion (unless there is concomitant use of an agent that can lead to hypoglycemia〞sulfonylureas, etc.). Exenatide, a synthetic version of a peptide initially identified in the saliva of the Gila monster (exendin-4), is an analogue of GLP-1. Unlike native GLP-1, which has a half-life of <5 min, differences in the exenatide amino acid sequence render it resistant to the enzyme that degrades GLP-1 (dipeptidyl peptidase IV, or DPP-IV). Thus, exenatide has prolonged GLP-1-like action and binds to GLP-1 receptors found in islets, the gastrointestinal tract, and the brain. Liraglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist, is almost identical to native GLP-1 except for an amino acid substitution and addition of a fatty acyl group (coupled with a -glutamic acid spacer) that promote binding to albumin and plasma proteins and prolong its half-life. GLP-1 receptor agonists increase glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, suppress glucagon, and slow gastric emptying. These agents do not promote weight gain; in fact, most patients experience modest weight loss and appetite suppression. Treatment with these agents should start at a low dose to minimize initial side effects (nausea being the limiting one). Exenatide is approved for monotherapy and for use as combination therapy with metformin, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones. Some patients taking insulin secretagogues may require a reduction in those agents to prevent hypoglycemia. GLP-1 receptor agonists should not be used in patients taking insulin. The major side effects are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; pancreatitis and reduced renal function have been reported in surveillance data with exenatide. Liraglutide carries a black box warning from the FDA because of an increased risk of thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents and is contraindicated in individuals with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid and multiple endocrine neoplasia. Because GLP-1 receptor agonists slow gastric emptying, they may influence the absorption of other drugs. Whether GLP-1 receptor agonists enhance beta cell survival, promote beta cell proliferation, or alter the natural history of type 2 DM is not known. Other GLP-1 receptor agonists and formulations are under development.

DPP-IV inhibitors inhibit degradation of native GLP-1 and thus enhance the incretin effect. DPP-IV, which is widely expressed on the cell surface of endothelial cells and some lymphocytes, degrades a wide range of peptides (not GLP-1 specific). DPP-IV inhibitors promote insulin secretion in the absence of hypoglycemia or weight gain, and appear to have a preferential effect on postprandial blood glucose. DPP-IV inhibitors are used either alone or in combination with other oral agents in adults with type 2 DM. Reduced doses should be given to patients with renal insufficiency. These agents have relatively few side effects.

-Glucosidase Inhibitors

-Glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose and miglitol) reduce postprandial hyperglycemia by delaying glucose absorption; they do not affect glucose utilization or insulin secretion (Table 344-11). Postprandial hyperglycemia, secondary to impaired hepatic and peripheral glucose disposal, contributes significantly to the hyperglycemic state in type 2 DM. These drugs, taken just before each meal, reduce glucose absorption by inhibiting the enzyme that cleaves oligosaccharides into simple sugars in the intestinal lumen. Therapy should be initiated at a low dose (25 mg of acarbose or miglitol) with the evening meal and may be increased to a maximal dose over weeks to months (50每100 mg for acarbose or 50 mg for miglitol with each meal). The major side effects (diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal distention) are related to increased delivery of oligosaccharides to the large bowel and can be reduced somewhat by gradual upward dose titration. -Glucosidase inhibitors may increase levels of sulfonylureas and increase the incidence of hypoglycemia. Simultaneous treatment with bile acid resins and antacids should be avoided. These agents should not be used in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease, gastroparesis, or a serum creatinine >177 mol/L (2 mg/dL). This class of agents is not as potent as other oral agents in lowering the A1C but is unique because it reduces the postprandial glucose rise even in individuals with type 1 DM. If hypoglycemia from other diabetes treatments occurs while taking these agents, the patient should consume glucose since the degradation and absorption of complex carbohydrates will be retarded.

Thiazolidinediones

Thiazolidinediones reduce insulin resistance by binding to the PPAR- (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ) nuclear receptor (which forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor). The PPAR- receptor is found at highest levels in adipocytes but is expressed at lower levels in many other tissues. Agonists of this receptor regulate a large number of genes, promote adipocyte differentiation, reduce hepatic fat accumulation, and promote fatty acid storage (Table 344-11). Thiazolidinediones promote a redistribution of fat from central to peripheral locations. Circulating insulin levels decrease with use of the thiazolidinediones, indicating a reduction in insulin resistance. Although direct comparisons are not available, the two currently available thiazolidinediones appear to have similar efficacy; the therapeutic range for pioglitazone is 15每45 mg/d in a single daily dose, and for rosiglitazone the total daily dose is 2每8 mg/d administered either once daily or twice daily in divided doses. The prototype of this class of drugs, troglitazone, was withdrawn from the U.S. market after reports of hepatotoxicity and an association with an idiosyncratic liver reaction that sometimes led to hepatic failure. Although rosiglitazone and pioglitazone do not appear to induce the liver abnormalities seen with troglitazone, the FDA recommends measurement of liver function tests prior to initiating therapy with a thiazolidinedione and at regular intervals (every 2 months for the first year and then periodically).

Rosiglitazone raises LDL, HDL, and triglycerides slightly. Pioglitazone raises HDL to a greater degree and LDL a lesser degree but lowers triglycerides. The clinical significance of the lipid changes with these agents is not known and may be difficult to ascertain since most patients with type 2 diabetes are also treated with a statin.

Thiazolidinediones are associated with weight gain (2每3 kg), a small reduction in the hematocrit, and a mild increase in plasma volume. Peripheral edema and CHF are more common in individuals treated with these agents. These agents are contraindicated in patients with liver disease or CHF (class III or IV). The FDA has issued an alert that rare patients taking these agents may experience a worsening of diabetic macular edema. An increased risk of fractures has been noted in women taking these agents. Thiazolidinediones have been shown to induce ovulation in premenopausal women with PCOS. Women should be warned about the risk of pregnancy, since the safety of thiazolidinediones in pregnancy is not established.

Recent concerns about increased cardiovascular risk associated with rosiglitazone have led to considerable restrictions on its use. The FDA issued a "black box" warning for rosiglitazone in 2007. Under recent FDA guidelines (September 2010), new prescriptions for rosiglitazone in the United States must be written under a "risk evaluation and mitigation strategy" and only for patients with diabetes that cannot be controlled by other medications. The European Medicines Agency (2010) advised removal of rosiglitazone and formulations containing rosiglitazone from the European market. As a result of thesse rulings, rosiglitazone will be available in the United States on a limited basis, but will not be available in Europe.

Other Therapies for Type 2 Diabetes

Bile acid每binding resins. Bile acid metabolism is abnormal type 2 diabetes. The bile acid每binding resin colesevelam has been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (already approved for treatment of hypercholesterolemia). Emerging evidence indicates that bile acids, by signaling through nuclear receptors, may have a role in metabolism. Since bile acid每binding resins are minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation, how bile acid每binding resins lower blood glucose is not known. Colesevelam (available as a powder for oral solution and as 625-mg tablets) is prescribed as 3每6 tablets prior to meals. The most common side effects are gastrointestinal (constipation, abdominal pain, and nausea). Bile acid每binding resins can increase plasma triglycerides and should be used cautiously in patients with a tendency to hypertriglyceridemia. The role of this class of drugs in the treatment of type 2 diabetes is not yet defined.

Bromocriptine. A formulation of the dopamine receptor agonist bromocriptine (Cycloset), has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (approved in 2009). However, this formulation is not available in the United States, and its role in the treatment of type 2 diabetes is uncertain.

Insulin Therapy in Type 2 DM

Insulin should be considered as the initial therapy in type 2 DM, particularly in lean individuals or those with severe weight loss, in individuals with underlying renal or hepatic disease that precludes oral glucose-lowering agents, or in individuals who are hospitalized or acutely ill. Insulin therapy is ultimately required by a substantial number of individuals with type 2 DM because of the progressive nature of the disorder and the relative insulin deficiency that develops in patients with long-standing diabetes. Both physician and patient reluctance often delay the initiation of insulin therapy, but glucose control and patient well-being are improved by insulin therapy in patients who have not reached the glycemic target.

Because endogenous insulin secretion continues and is capable of providing some coverage of mealtime caloric intake, insulin is usually initiated in a single dose of long-acting insulin (0.3每0.4 U/kg per day), given either before breakfast and in the evening (NPH) or just before bedtime (NPH, glargine, detemir). Since fasting hyperglycemia and increased hepatic glucose production are prominent features of type 2 DM, bedtime insulin is more effective in clinical trials than a single dose of morning insulin. Glargine given at bedtime has less nocturnal hypoglycemia than NPH insulin. Some physicians prefer a relatively low, fixed starting dose of long-acting insulin (5每15 units) to reduce the chance of hypoglycemia in the initial treatment period. The insulin dose may then be adjusted in 10% increments as dictated by SMBG results. Both morning and bedtime long-acting insulin may be used in combination with oral glucose-lowering agents. Initially, basal insulin may be sufficient, but more often prandial insulin coverage with multiple insulin injections is needed as diabetes progresses (see insulin regimens used for type 1 diabetes). Other insulin formulations that have a combination of short-acting and long-acting insulin (Table 344-10) are sometimes used in patients with type 2 DM because of convenience but do not allow independent adjustment of short-acting and long-acting insulin dose and often do not achieve the same degree of glycemic control as basal/bolus regimens. In selected patients with type 2 DM (usually insulin deficient as defined by C-peptide level), insulin infusion devices may be considered.

Choice of Initial Glucose-Lowering Agent

The level of hyper-glycemia should influence the initial choice of therapy. Assuming maximal benefit of MNT and increased physical activity has been realized, patients with mild to moderate hyperglycemia [FPG <11.1每13.9 mmol/L (200每250 mg/dL)] often respond well to a single, oral glucose-lowering agent. Patients with more severe hyperglycemia [FPG >13.9 mmol/L (250 mg/dL)] may respond partially but are unlikely to achieve normoglycemia with oral monotherapy. A stepwise approach that starts with a single agent and adds a second agent to achieve the glycemic target can be used (see "Combination Therapy," below). Insulin can be used as initial therapy in individuals with severe hyperglycemia [FPG >13.9每16.7 mmol/L (250每300 mg/dL)] or in those who are symptomatic from the hyperglycemia. This approach is based on the rationale that more rapid glycemic control will reduce "glucose toxicity" to the islet cells, improve endogenous insulin secretion, and possibly allow oral glucose-lowering agents to be more effective. If this occurs, the insulin may be discontinued.

Insulin secretagogues, biguanides, -glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-IV inhibitors, and insulin are approved for monotherapy of type 2 DM. Although each class of oral glucose-lowering agents has unique advantages and disadvantages, certain generalizations apply: (1) insulin secretagogues, biguanides, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and thiazolidinediones improve glycemic control to a similar degree (1每2% reduction in A1C) and are more effective than -glucosidase inhibitors and DPP-IV inhibitors; (2) assuming a similar degree of glycemic improvement, no clinical advantage to one class of drugs has been demonstrated, and any therapy that improves glycemic control is likely beneficial; (3) insulin secretagogues, GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-IV inhibitors, and -glucosidase inhibitors begin to lower the plasma glucose immediately, whereas the glucose-lowering effects of the biguanides and thiazolidinediones are delayed by several weeks; (4) not all agents are effective in all individuals with type 2 DM (primary failure); (5) biguanides, -glucosidase inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-IV inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones do not directly cause hypoglycemia; and (6) most individuals will eventually require treatment with more than one class of oral glucose-lowering agents or insulin, reflecting the progressive nature of type 2 DM; (7) durability of glycemic control is slightly less for glyburide compared to metformin or rosiglitazone.

Considerable clinical experience exists with metformin and sulfonylureas because they have been available for several decades. It is assumed that the -glucosidase inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, DPP-IV inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones, which are newer classes of oral glucose-lowering drugs, will reduce DM-related complications by improving glycemic control, although long-term data are not yet available. The thiazolidine-diones are theoretically attractive because they target a fundamental abnormality in type 2 DM, namely insulin resistance. However, all of these agents are currently more costly than metformin and sulfonylureas.

A reasonable treatment algorithm for initial therapy uses metformin as initial therapy because of its efficacy, known side-effect profile, and relatively low cost (Fig. 344-14). Metformin has the advantage that it promotes mild weight loss, lowers insulin levels, and improves the lipid profile slightly. Based on SMBG results and the A1C, the dose of metformin should be increased until the glycemic target is achieved or maximum dose is reached.

Combination Therapy with Glucose-Lowering Agents

A number of combinations of therapeutic agents are successful in type 2 DM, and the dosing of agents in combination is the same as when the agents are used alone. Because mechanisms of action of the first and second agents used are different, the effect on glycemic control is usually additive. Several fixed dose combinations of oral agents are available, but evidence that they are superior to titration of single agent to a maximum dose and then addition of a second agent is lacking. If adequate control is not achieved with the combination of two agents (based on reassessment of the A1C every 3 months), a third oral agent or basal insulin should be added (Fig. 344-14).

Treatment with insulin becomes necessary as type 2 DM enters the phase of relative insulin deficiency (as seen in long-standing DM) and is signaled by inadequate glycemic control with one or two oral glucose-lowering agents. Insulin alone or in combination should be used in patients who fail to reach the glycemic target. For example, a single dose of long-acting insulin at bedtime is effective in combination with metformin. As endogenous insulin production falls further, multiple injections of long-acting and short-acting insulin regimens are necessary to control postprandial glucose excursions. These insulin regimens are identical to the long-acting and short-acting combination regimens discussed above for type 1 DM. Since the hyper-glycemia of type 2 DM tends to be more "stable," these regimens can be increased in 10% increments every 2每3 days using the FBG results. The daily insulin dose required can become quite large (1每2 units/kg per day) as endogenous insulin production falls and insulin resistance persists. Individuals who require >1 unit/kg per day of long-acting insulin should be considered for combination therapy with metformin or a thiazolidinedione. The addition of metformin or a thiazolidinedione can reduce insulin requirements in some individuals with type 2 DM, while maintaining or even improving glycemic control. Insulin plus a thiazolidinedione promotes weight gain and is associated with peripheral edema. Addition of a thiazolidinedione to a patient's insulin regimen may necessitate a reduction in the insulin dose to avoid hypoglycemia.

Emerging Therapies

Whole pancreas transplantation (performed concomitantly with a renal transplant) may normalize glucose tolerance and is an important therapeutic option in type 1 DM with ESRD, though it requires substantial expertise and is associated with the side effects of immunosuppression. Pancreatic islet transplantation has been plagued by limitations in pancreatic islet supply and graft survival and remains an area of clinical investigation. Many individuals with long-standing type 1 DM still produce very small amounts of insulin or have insulin-positive cells within the pancreas. This suggests that beta cells may slowly regenerate but are quickly destroyed by the autoimmune process. Thus, efforts to suppress the autoimmune process and to stimulate beta cell regeneration are being tested both at the time of diagnosis and in years after the diagnosis of type 1 DM. Closed-loop pumps that infuse the appropriate amount of insulin in response to changing glucose levels are potentially feasible now that continuous glucose-monitoring technology has been developed. New therapies under development for type 2 diabetes include an inhibitor of the sodium-glucose co- transporter in the kidney, activators of glucokinase, an inhibitor of 11 -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1, and salsalate.

Bariatric surgery for markedly obese individuals with type 2 diabetes has shown considerable promise〞sometimes with resolution of the diabetes or major reductions in the needed dose of glucose-lowering therapies (Chap. 78). The ADA clinical guidelines state that bariatric surgery should be considered in individuals with DM and a BMI >35 kg/m2.
 
Complications of Therapy for Diabetes Mellitus

As with any therapy, the benefits of efforts directed toward glycemic control must be balanced against the risks of treatment. Side effects of intensive treatment include an increased frequency of serious hypoglycemia, weight gain, increased economic costs, and greater demands on the patient. In the DCCT, quality of life was very similar in the intensive and standard therapy groups. The most serious complication of therapy for DM is hypoglycemia, and its treatment with oral glucose or glucagon injection is discussed in Chap. 345. Severe, recurrent hypoglycemia warrants examination of treatment regimen and glycemic goal for the individual patient. Weight gain occurs with most (insulin, insulin secretagogues, thiazolidine-diones) but not all (metformin, -glucosidase inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-IV inhibitors) therapies that improve glycemic control. The weight gain is partially due to the anabolic effects of insulin and the reduction in glucosuria. In the DCCT, individuals with the greatest weight gain exhibited increases in LDL cholesterol and triglycerides as well as increases in blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) similar to those seen in individuals with type 2 DM and insulin resistance. These effects could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. As discussed previously, transient worsening of diabetic retinopathy or neuropathy sometimes accompanies improved glycemic control. As a result of recent controversies about the optimal glycemic goal and concerns about safety, the FDA now requires information about the cardiovascular safety profile as part of its new evaluation for treatment of type 2 diabetes.
 
Ongoing Aspects of Comprehensive Diabetes Care

The morbidity and mortality rates of DM-related complications can be greatly reduced by timely and consistent surveillance procedures (Table 344-13). These screening procedures are indicated for all individuals with DM, but many individuals with diabetes do not receive comprehensive diabetes care. Screening for dyslipidemia and hypertension should be performed annually. In addition to routine health maintenance, individuals with diabetes should also receive the pneumococcal and tetanus vaccines (at recommended intervals) and the influenza vaccine (annually). As discussed above, aspirin therapy should be considered in many patients with diabetes (primary prevention in type 1 or type 2 DM men >50 years or women >60 years with one risk factor CV disease), but its role in primary prevention in low-risk individuals is uncertain and not recommended.

An annual comprehensive eye examination should be performed by a qualified optometrist or ophthalmologist. If abnormalities are detected, further evaluation and treatment require an ophthalmologist skilled in diabetes-related eye disease. Because many individuals with type 2 DM have had asymptomatic diabetes for several years before diagnosis, the ADA recommends the following ophthalmologic examination schedule: (1) individuals with type 1 DM should have an initial eye examination within 5 years of diagnosis, (2) individuals with type 2 DM should have an initial eye examination at the time of diabetes diagnosis, (3) women with DM who are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy should have an eye examination prior to conception and during the first trimester, and (4) if eye exam is normal, repeat examination in 2每3 years may be appropriate.

An annual foot examination should (1) assess blood flow, sensation (monofilament testing, pin prick, or tuning fork), ankle reflexes, and nail care; (2) look for the presence of foot deformities such as hammer or claw toes and Charcot foot; and (3) identify sites of potential ulceration. The ADA recommends annual screening for distal symmetric neuropathy beginning with the initial diagnosis of diabetes and annual screening for autonomic neuropathy 5 years after diagnosis of type 1 DM and at the time of diagnosis of type 2 DM. This includes testing for loss of protective sensation (LOPS) using monofilament testing plus one of the following tests: vibration, pinprick, ankle reflexes, or vibration perception threshold (using a biothesiometer). If the monofilament test or one of the other tests is abnormal, the patient is diagnosed with LOPS and counseled accordingly. Calluses and nail deformities should be treated by a podiatrist; the patient should be discouraged from self-care of even minor foot problems but should be strongly encouraged to check his or her feet daily for any early lesions. Providers should consider screening for asymptomatic peripheral arterial disease using ankle-brachial index testing in high-risk individuals.

An annual microalbuminuria measurement (albumin-to- creatinine ratio in spot urine) is advised in individuals with type 1 or type 2 DM (Fig. 344-10). The urine protein measurement in a routine urinalysis does not detect these low levels of albumin excretion (microalbuminuria). Screening for microalbuminuria should commence 5 years after the onset of type 1 DM and at the time of diagnosis of type 2 DM. Regardless of protein excretion results, the GFR should be estimated using the serum creatinine in all patients on an annual basis.
 
Special Considerations in Diabetes Mellitus

Psychosocial Aspects

Because the individual with DM can face challenges that affect many aspects of daily life, psychosocial assessment and treatment are a critical part of providing comprehensive diabetes care. The individual with DM must accept that he or she may develop complications related to DM. Even with considerable effort, normoglycemia can be an elusive goal, and solutions to worsening glycemic control may not be easily identifiable. The patient should view him- or herself as an essential member of the diabetes care team and not as someone who is cared for by the diabetes management team. Emotional stress may provoke a change in behavior so that individuals no longer adhere to a dietary, exercise, or therapeutic regimen. This can lead to the appearance of either hyper- or hypoglycemia. Eating disorders, including binge eating disorders, bulimia, and anorexia nervosa, appear to occur more frequently in individuals with type 1 or type 2 DM (Chap. 79).

Management in the Hospitalized Patient

Virtually all medical and surgical subspecialties are involved in the care of hospitalized patients with diabetes. Hyperglycemia, whether in a patient with known diabetes or in someone without known diabetes, appears to be a predictor of poor outcome in hospitalized patients. General anesthesia, surgery, infection, or concurrent illness raises the levels of counterregulatory hormones (cortisol, growth hormone, catecholamines, and glucagon) and cytokines that may lead to transient insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. These factors increase insulin requirements by increasing glucose production and impairing glucose utilization and thus may worsen glycemic control. The concurrent illness or surgical procedure may lead to variable insulin absorption and also prevent the patient with DM from eating normally and, thus, may promote hypoglycemia. Glycemic control should be assessed on admission using the A1C. Electrolytes, renal function, and intravascular volume status should be assessed as well. The high prevalence of cardiovascular disease in individuals with DM (especially in type 2 DM) may require preoperative cardiovascular evaluation.

The goals of diabetes management during hospitalization are near-normoglycemia, avoidance of hypoglycemia, and transition back to the outpatient diabetes treatment regimen. Glycemic control appears to improve the clinical outcomes in a variety of settings, but optimal glycemic goals for the hospitalized patient are incompletely defined. In a number of cross-sectional studies of patients with diabetes, a greater degree of hyperglycemia was associated with worse cardiac, neurologic, and infectious outcomes. In some studies, patients who do not have preexisting diabetes but who develop modest blood glucose elevations during their hospitalization appear to benefit from achieving near-normoglycemia using insulin treatment. However, a large randomized clinical trial (NICE-SUGAR) of individuals in the intensive care unit (most of whom were receiving mechanical ventilation) found an increased mortality rate and a greater number of episodes of severe hypoglycemia with very strict glycemic control [target BG of 4.5每6 mmol/L or 81每108 mg/dL] compared to individuals with a more moderate glycemic goal (mean blood glucose of 8 mmol/L or 144 mg/dL). Currently, most data suggest that very strict blood glucose control in acutely ill patients likely worsens outcomes and increases the frequency of hypoglycemia. The ADA suggests these glycemic goals for hospitalized patients: (1) in critically ill patients: glucose of 7.8每10.0 mmol/L or 140每180 mg/dL; (2) in non每critically ill patients: pre-meal glucose <7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) and at other times BG <10 mmol/L (180 mg/dL).

The physician caring for an individual with diabetes in the perioperative period, during times of infection or serious physical illness, or simply when the patient is fasting for a diagnostic procedure must monitor the plasma glucose vigilantly, adjust the diabetes treatment regimen, and provide glucose infusion as needed. Hypoglycemia is frequent in hospitalized patients, and many of these episodes are avoidable. Measures to reduce or prevent hypoglycemia include frequent glucose monitoring and anticipating potential modifications of insulin/glucose administration because of changes in the clinical situation or treatment (tapering of glucocorticoids, etc.) or interruption of enteral or parenteral infusions or PO intake.

Depending on the severity of the patient's illness and the hospital setting, the physician can use either an insulin infusion or SC insulin. Insulin infusions are preferred in the ICU or in a clinically unstable setting. The absorption of SC insulin may be variable in such situations. Insulin infusions can also effectively control plasma glucose in the perioperative period and when the patient is unable to take anything by mouth. Regular insulin is preferred over insulin analogues for IV insulin infusion since it is less expensive and equally effective. The physician must consider carefully the clinical setting in which an insulin infusion will be utilized, including whether adequate ancillary personnel are available to monitor the plasma glucose frequently and whether they can adjust the insulin infusion rate to maintain the plasma glucose within the optimal range. Insulin-infusion algorithms should integrate the insulin sensitivity of the patient, frequent blood glucose monitoring, and the trend of changes in the blood glucose to determine the insulin-infusion rate. Insulin-infusion algorithms jointly developed and implemented by nursing and physician staff are advised. Because of the short half-life of IV regular insulin, it is necessary to administer long-acting insulin prior to discontinuation of the insulin infusion (2每4 h) to avoid a period of insulin deficiency.

In patients who are not critically ill or not in the ICU, basal or "scheduled" insulin is provided by SC, long-acting insulin supplemented by prandial and/or "corrective" insulin using a short-acting insulin (insulin analogues preferred). The use of "sliding scale," short-acting insulin alone, where no insulin is given unless the blood glucose is elevated, is inadequate for in-patient glucose management and should not be used. The short-acting, preprandial insulin dose should include coverage for food consumption (based on anticipated carbohydrate intake) plus a corrective or supplemental insulin based on the patient's insulin sensitivity and the blood glucose. For example, if the patient is thin (and likely insulin-sensitive), a corrective insulin supplement might be 1 unit for each 2.7 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) over the glucose target. If the patient is obese and insulin-resistant, then the insulin supplement might be 2 units for each 2.7 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) over the glucose target. It is critical to individualize the regimen and adjust the basal or "scheduled" insulin dose frequently, based on the corrective insulin required. A "consistent carbohydrate diabetes meal plan" for hospitalized patients provides a predictable amount of carbohydrate for a particular meal each day (but not necessarily the same amount for breakfast, lunch, and supper). The hospital diet should be determined by a nutritionist; terms such as ADA diet or low-sugar diet are no longer used.

Individuals with type 1 DM who are undergoing general anesthesia and surgery, or who are seriously ill, should receive continuous insulin, either through an IV insulin infusion or by SC administration of a reduced dose of long-acting insulin. Short-acting insulin alone is insufficient. Prolongation of a surgical procedure or delay in the recovery room is not uncommon and may result in periods of insulin deficiency leading to DKA. Insulin infusion is the preferred method for managing patients with type 1 DM in the perioperative period or when serious concurrent illness is present (0.5每1.0 units/h of regular insulin). If the diagnostic or surgical procedure is brief and performed under local or regional anesthesia, a reduced dose of SC, long-acting insulin may suffice (30每50% reduction, with short-acting insulin withheld or reduced). This approach facilitates the transition back to long-acting insulin after the procedure. Glucose may be infused to prevent hypoglycemia. The blood glucose should be monitored frequently during the illness or in the perioperative period.

Individuals with type 2 DM can be managed with either an insulin infusion or SC long-acting insulin (25每50% reduction depending on clinical setting) plus preprandial, short-acting insulin. Oral glucose-lowering agents should be discontinued upon admission and are not useful in regulating the plasma glucose in clinical situations where the insulin requirements and glucose intake are changing rapidly. Moreover, these oral agents may be dangerous if the patient is fasting (e.g., hypoglycemia with sulfonylureas). Metformin should be withheld when radiographic contrast media will be given or if severe CHF, acidosis, or declining renal function is present.

Total Parenteral Nutrition

(See also Chap. 76.) Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) greatly increases insulin requirements. In addition, individuals not previously known to have DM may become hyperglycemic during TPN and require insulin treatment. IV insulin infusion is the preferred treatment for hyperglycemia, and rapid titration to the required insulin dose is done most efficiently using a separate insulin infusion. After the total insulin dose has been determined, insulin may be added directly to the TPN solution or, preferably, given as a separate infusion. Often, individuals receiving either TPN or enteral nutrition receive their caloric loads continuously and not at "meal times"; consequently, SC insulin regimens must be adjusted.

Glucocorticoids

Glucocorticoids increase insulin resistance, decrease glucose utilization, increase hepatic glucose production, and impair insulin secretion. These changes lead to a worsening of glycemic control in individuals with DM and may precipitate diabetes in other individuals ("steroid-induced diabetes"). The effects of glucocorticoids on glucose homeostasis are dose-related, usually reversible, and most pronounced in the postprandial period. If the FPG is near the normal range, oral diabetes agents (e.g., sulfonylureas, metformin) may be sufficient to reduce hyperglycemia. If the FPG >11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), oral agents are usually not efficacious and insulin therapy is required. Short-acting insulin may be required to supplement long-acting insulin in order to control postprandial glucose excursions.

Reproductive Issues

Reproductive capacity in either men or women with DM appears to be normal. Menstrual cycles may be associated with alterations in glycemic control in women with DM. Pregnancy is associated with marked insulin resistance; the increased insulin requirements often precipitate DM and lead to the diagnosis of GDM. Glucose, which at high levels is a teratogen to the developing fetus, readily crosses the placenta, but insulin does not. Thus, hyperglycemia from the maternal circulation may stimulate insulin secretion in the fetus. The anabolic and growth effects of insulin may result in macrosomia. GDM complicates 7% of pregnancies in the United States. The incidence of GDM is greatly increased in certain ethnic groups, including African Americans and Latinas, consistent with a similar increased risk of type 2 DM. Current recommendations advise screening for glucose intolerance between weeks 24 and 28 of pregnancy in women with increased risk for GDM (25 years; obesity; family history of DM; member of an ethnic group such as Latina, Native American, Asian American, African American, or Pacific Islander). Therapy for GDM is similar to that for individuals with pregnancy-associated diabetes and involves MNT and insulin, if hyperglycemia persists. Oral glucose-lowering agents are not approved for use during pregnancy, but studies using metformin or glyburide have shown efficacy and have not found toxicity. However, most physicians use insulin to treat GDM. With current practices, the morbidity and mortality rates of the mother with GDM and the fetus are not different from those in the nondiabetic population. Individuals who develop GDM are at marked increased risk for developing type 2 DM in the future and should be screened periodically for DM. Most individuals with GDM revert to normal glucose tolerance after delivery, but some will continue to have overt diabetes or impairment of glucose tolerance after delivery. In addition, children of women with GDM appear to be at risk for obesity and glucose intolerance and have an increased risk of diabetes beginning in the later stages of adolescence.

Pregnancy in individuals with known DM requires meticulous planning and adherence to strict treatment regimens. Intensive diabetes management and normalization of the A1C are essential for individuals with existing DM who are planning pregnancy. The most crucial period of glycemic control is soon after fertilization. The risk of fetal malformations is increased 4每10 times in individuals with uncontrolled DM at the time of conception, and normal plasma glucose during the preconception period and throughout the periods of organ development in the fetus should be the goal.

Lipodystrophic DM

Lipodystrophy, or the loss of subcutaneous fat tissue, may be generalized in certain genetic conditions such as leprechaunism. Generalized lipodystrophy is associated with severe insulin resistance and is often accompanied by acanthosis nigricans and dyslipidemia. Localized lipodystrophy associated with insulin injections has been reduced considerably by the use of human insulin.

Protease Inhibitors and Lipodystrophy

Protease inhibitors used in the treatment of HIV disease (Chap. 189) have been associated with a centripetal accumulation of fat (visceral and abdominal area), accumulation of fat in the dorsocervical region, loss of extremity fat, decreased insulin sensitivity (elevations of the fasting insulin level and reduced glucose tolerance on IV glucose tolerance testing), and dyslipidemia. Although many aspects of the physical appearance of these individuals resemble Cushing's syndrome, increased cortisol levels do not account for this appearance. The possibility remains that this is related to HIV infection by some undefined mechanism, since some features of the syndrome were observed before the introduction of protease inhibitors. Therapy for HIV-related lipodystrophy is not well established.

Chapter 345. Hypoglycemia >
 

Hypoglycemia: Introduction

Hypoglycemia is most commonly caused by drugs used to treat diabetes mellitus or by exposure to other drugs, including alcohol. However, a number of other disorders, including critical organ failure, sepsis and inanition, hormone deficiencies, non每beta-cell tumors, insulinoma, and prior gastric surgery, may cause hypoglycemia (Table 345-1). Hypoglycemia is most convincingly documented by Whipple's triad: (1) symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia, (2) a low plasma glucose concentration measured with a precise method (not a glucose monitor), and (3) relief of those symptoms after the plasma glucose level is raised. The lower limit of the fasting plasma glucose concentration is normally approximately 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), but substantially lower venous glucose levels occur normally, late after a meal. Glucose levels <55 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) with symptoms that are relieved promptly after the glucose level is raised document hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can cause serious morbidity; if severe and prolonged, it can be fatal. It should be considered in any patient with episodes of confusion, an altered level of consciousness, or a seizure.

Systemic Glucose Balance and Glucose Counterregulation

Glucose is an obligate metabolic fuel for the brain under physiologic conditions. The brain cannot synthesize glucose or store more than a few minutes' supply as glycogen and therefore requires a continuous supply of glucose from the arterial circulation. As the arterial plasma glucose concentration falls below the physiologic range, blood-to-brain glucose transport becomes insufficient to support brain energy metabolism and function. However, redundant glucose counterregulatory mechanisms normally prevent or rapidly correct hypoglycemia.

Plasma glucose concentrations are normally maintained within a relatively narrow range, roughly 70每110 mg/dL (3.9每6.1 mmol/L) in the fasting state with transient higher excursions after a meal, despite wide variations in exogenous glucose delivery from meals and in endogenous glucose utilization by, for example, exercising muscle. Between meals and during fasting, plasma glucose levels are maintained by endogenous glucose production, hepatic glycogenolysis, and hepatic (and renal) gluconeogenesis (Fig. 345-1). Although hepatic glycogen stores are usually sufficient to maintain plasma glucose levels for approximately 8 h, this time period can be shorter if glucose demand is increased by exercise or if glycogen stores are depleted by illness or starvation.

Figure 345-1

 
 
 
Physiology of glucose counterregulation〞the mechanisms that normally prevent or rapidly correct hypoglycemia. In insulin-deficient diabetes, the key counterregulatory responses〞suppression of insulin and increase of glucagon〞are lost, and the stimulation of sympathoadrenal outflow is attenuated.
 
 

Gluconeogenesis normally requires low insulin levels and the presence of anti-insulin (counterregulatory) hormones, together with a coordinated supply of precursors from muscle and adipose tissue to the liver (and kidneys). Muscle provides lactate, pyruvate, alanine, glutamine, and other amino acids. Triglycerides in adipose tissue are broken down into fatty acids and glycerol, which is a gluconeogenic precursor. Fatty acids provide an alternative oxidative fuel to tissues other than the brain (which requires glucose).

Systemic glucose balance〞maintenance of the normal plasma glucose concentration〞is accomplished by a network of hormones, neural signals, and substrate effects that regulate endogenous glucose production and glucose utilization by tissues other than the brain (Chap. 344). Among the regulatory factors, insulin plays a dominant role (Table 345-2; Fig. 345-1). As plasma glucose levels decline within the physiologic range in the fasting state, pancreatic beta-cell insulin secretion decreases, thereby increasing hepatic glycogenolysis and hepatic (and renal) gluconeogenesis. Low insulin levels also reduce glucose utilization in peripheral tissues, inducing lipolysis and proteolysis, thereby releasing gluconeogenic precursors. Thus, a decrease in insulin secretion is the first defense against hypoglycemia.

As plasma glucose levels decline just below the physiologic range, glucose counterregulatory (plasma glucose每raising) hormones are released (Table 345-2; Fig. 345-1). Among these, pancreatic -cell glucagon, which stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis, plays a primary role. Glucagon is the second defense against hypoglycemia. Adrenomedullary epinephrine, which stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis (and renal gluconeogenesis), is not normally critical. However, it becomes critical when glucagon is deficient. Epinephrine is the third defense against hypoglycemia. When hypoglycemia is prolonged beyond 4 hours, cortisol and growth hormone also support glucose production and limit glucose utilization, albeit only 20% of that of epinephrine.

As plasma glucose levels fall to lower levels, symptoms prompt the behavioral defense against hypoglycemia, including the ingestion of food (Table 345-2; Fig. 345-1).

The normal glycemic thresholds for these responses to decreasing plasma glucose concentrations are shown in Table 345-2. However, these thresholds are dynamic. They shift to higher-than-normal glucose levels in people with poorly controlled diabetes who can experience symptoms of hypoglycemia when their glucose levels decline into the normal range. On the other hand, they shift to lower-than-normal glucose levels in people with recurrent hypoglycemia, e.g., those with aggressively treated diabetes or an insulinoma. Such patients have symptoms at glucose levels lower than those that cause symptoms in healthy individuals.

Clinical Manifestations

Neuroglycopenic symptoms of hypoglycemia are the direct result of central nervous system (CNS) glucose deprivation. They include behavioral changes, confusion, fatigue, seizure, loss of consciousness, and, if hypoglycemia is severe and prolonged, death. Neurogenic (or autonomic) symptoms of hypoglycemia are the result of the perception of physiologic changes caused by the CNS-mediated sympathoadrenal discharge triggered by hypoglycemia. They include adrenergic symptoms (mediated largely by norepinephrine released from sympathetic postganglionic neurons but perhaps also by epinephrine released from the adrenal medullae) such as palpitations, tremor, and anxiety. They also include cholinergic symptoms (mediated by acetylcholine released from sympathetic postganglionic neurons) such as sweating, hunger, and paresthesias. Clearly, these are nonspecific symptoms. Their attribution to hypoglycemia requires a corresponding low plasma glucose concentration and their resolution after the glucose level is raised (Whipple's triad).

Common signs of hypoglycemia include diaphoresis and pallor. Heart rate and systolic blood pressure are typically increased but may not be raised in an individual who has experienced repeated, recent episodes of hypoglycemia. Neuroglycopenic manifestations are often observable. Transient focal neurologic deficits occur occasionally. Permanent neurologic deficits are rare.

Etiology and Pathophysiology

Hypoglycemia is most commonly a result of the treatment of diabetes. This topic is therefore addressed before considering other causes of hypoglycemia.

Hypoglycemia in Diabetes

Impact and Frequency

Hypoglycemia is the limiting factor in the glycemic management of diabetes. First, it causes recurrent morbidity in most people with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and many with advanced type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and is sometimes fatal. Second, it precludes maintenance of euglycemia over a lifetime of diabetes and thus full realization of the well-established vascular benefits of glycemic control. Third, it causes a vicious cycle of recurrent hypoglycemia by producing hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure〞the clinical syndromes of defective glucose counterregulation and of hypoglycemia unawareness.

Hypoglycemia is a fact of life for people with T1DM. They suffer an average of two episodes of symptomatic hypoglycemia per week and at least one episode of severe, at least temporarily disabling, hypoglycemia each year. An estimated 6每10% of people with T1DM die as a result of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia occurs less frequently in T2DM. However, its prevalence in insulin-requiring T2DM is greater than commonly appreciated, Recent studies investigating insulin pump or multiple injection therapies have revealed a hypoglycemia prevalence approaching 70%. Metformin, thiazolidinediones, -glucosidase inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors should not cause hypoglycemia. However, they increase the risk when combined with an insulin secretagogue, such as one of the sulfonylureas or glinides, or with insulin. Notably, the frequency of hypoglycemia approaches that in T1DM as persons with T2DM develop absolute insulin deficiency and require more complex treatment with insulin.

Conventional Risk Factors

The conventional risk factors for hypoglycemia in diabetes are based on the premise that relative or absolute insulin excess is the sole determinant of risk. Relative or absolute insulin excess occurs when (1) insulin (or insulin secretagogue) doses are excessive, ill-timed, or of the wrong type; (2) the influx of exogenous glucose is reduced (e.g., during an overnight fast or following missed meals or snacks); (3) insulin-independent glucose utilization is increased (e.g., during exercise); (4) sensitivity to insulin is increased (e.g., with improved glycemic control, in the middle of the night, late after exercise, or with increased fitness or weight loss); (5) endogenous glucose production is reduced (e.g., following alcohol ingestion); and (6) insulin clearance is reduced (e.g., in renal failure). However, these conventional risk factors alone explain a minority of episodes; other factors are typically involved.

Hypoglycemia-Associated Autonomic Failure

While marked insulin excess alone can cause hypoglycemia, iatrogenic hypoglycemia in diabetes is typically the result of the interplay of relative or absolute therapeutic insulin excess and compromised physiologic and behavioral defenses against falling plasma glucose concentrations (Table 345-2; Fig. 345-2). Defective glucose counterregulation compromises physiologic defense (particularly decrements in insulin and increments in glucagon and epinephrine), and hypoglycemia unawareness compromises behavioral defense (ingestion of carbohydrate).

Defective Glucose Counterregulation

In the setting of absolute endogenous insulin deficiency, insulin levels do not decrease as plasma glucose levels fall; the first defense against hypoglycemia is lost. Furthermore, probably because the decrement in intraislet insulin is normally a signal to stimulate glucagon secretion, glucagon levels do not increase as plasma glucose levels fall further; the second defense against hypoglycemia is lost. Finally, the increase in epinephrine levels, the third defense against hypoglycemia, in response to a given level of hypoglycemia is typically attenuated. The glycemic threshold for the sympathoadrenal (adrenomedullary epinephrine and sympathetic neural norepinephrine) response is shifted to lower plasma glucose concentrations. That is typically the result of recent antecedent iatrogenic hypoglycemia. In the setting of absent decrements in insulin and of absent increments in glucagon, the attenuated increment in epinephrine causes the clinical syndrome of defective glucose counterregulation. Affected patients are at twenty-five-fold or greater increased risk of severe iatrogenic hypoglycemia during aggressive glycemic therapy of their diabetes compared with those with normal epinephrine responses. This functional, and reversible, disorder is distinct from classical diabetic autonomic neuropathy, a structural and irreversible disorder.

Hypoglycemia Unawareness

The attenuated sympathoadrenal response (largely the reduced sympathetic neural response) to hypoglycemia causes the clinical syndrome of hypoglycemia unawareness, i.e., loss of the warning adrenergic and cholinergic symptoms that previously allowed the patient to recognize developing hypoglycemia and therefore abort the episode by ingesting carbohydrates. Affected patients are at a sixfold increased risk of severe iatrogenic hypoglycemia during aggressive glycemic therapy of their diabetes.

Hypoglycemia-Associated Autonomic Failure

The concept of hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) in diabetes posits that recent antecedent iatrogenic hypoglycemia (or sleep or prior exercise) causes both defective glucose counterregulation (by reducing the epinephrine response to a given level of subsequent hypoglycemia in the setting of absent insulin and glucagon responses) and hypoglycemia unawareness (by reducing the sympathoadrenal response to a given level of subsequent hypoglycemia). These impaired responses create a vicious cycle of recurrent iatrogenic hypoglycemia (Fig. 345-2). Hypoglycemia unawareness, and to some extent the reduced epinephrine component of defective glucose counterregulation, is reversible by as little as 2每3 weeks of scrupulous avoidance of hypoglycemia in most affected patients.

Based on this pathophysiology, additional risk factors for hypoglycemia in diabetes include (1) absolute insulin deficiency that indicates that insulin levels will not decrease and glucagon levels will not increase as plasma glucose levels fall; (2) a history of severe hypoglycemia or of hypoglycemia unawareness, implying recent antecedent hypoglycemia, as well as prior exercise or sleep, that indicates that the sympathoadrenal response will be attenuated; and (3) lower HbA1C levels or lower glycemic goals that, all other factors being equal, increase the probability of recent antecedent hypoglycemia.

Hypoglycemia Risk Factor Reduction

Several recent multicenter randomized controlled trials investigating the potential benefits of tight glucose control in either inpatient or outpatient settings have reported a high prevalence of severe hypoglycemia. In the NICE-SUGAR study, attempts to control in-hospital plasma glucose values toward physiologic levels resulted in increased mortality. The ADVANCE, ACCORD, and VADT studies also reported a significant incidence of severe hypoglycemia in T2DM individuals. Somewhat surprisingly, all three studies found little or no benefit of intensive glucose control to reduce macrovascular events in T2DM. In fact, the ACCORD study was ended early due to increased mortality in the intensive glucose control arm. Whether iatrogenic hypoglycemia was the cause of the increased mortality is not known. In the light of the above findings, new recommendations and paradigms have been formulated. Whereas there is little debate regarding the need to reduce hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients, the glycemic maintenance goals have been modified to fall between 140 and 180 mg/dL. Thus, the benefits from insulin therapy and reduced hyperglycemia can be obtained while reducing the prevalence of hypoglycemia.

Similarly, evidence exists that intensive glucose control can reduce the prevalence of microvascular disease in both T1DM and T2DM. These benefits need to be weighed against the increased prevalence of hypoglycemia. The level of glucose control (HBA1C) should be evaluated for each patient. Multicenter trials have demonstrated that patients with recently diagnosed T1DM or T2DM can have better glycemic control with less hypoglycemia. In addition, there is still long-term benefit in reducing HBA1C from higher to lower levels, albeit still above recommended levels. Perhaps a reasonable therapeutic goal is the lowest HBA1C that does not cause severe hypoglycemia and preserves awareness of hypoglycemia.

Pancreatic transplantation (both whole organ and islet cells) has been used as a treatment option for recurrent severe hypoglycemia. Generally, rates of hypoglycemia are reduced following transplantation. This appears to be due to more physiologic insulin and glucagon responses during hypoglycemia following whole organ transplant and resolution of insulin modulation following islet cell transplantation.

The use of continuous glucose monitors appears promising as a method of reducing hypoglycemia while improving HBA1C. Other interventions to stimulate counterregulatory responses such as terbutaline, fluoxetine, thiazolidinediones or fructose remain experimental and have not been subjected to large-scale clinical trials.

Thus, intensive glycemic therapy (Chap. 344) needs to be applied in combination with patient education and empowerment; frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose; flexible insulin (and other drug) regimens including the use of insulin analogues (both short and longer acting); individualized glycemic goals; ongoing professional guidance and support; and consideration of both the conventional risk factors and those indicative of compromised glucose counterregulation. Given a history of hypoglycemia unawareness, a 2- to 3-week period of scrupulous avoidance of hypoglycemia is indicated.

Hypoglycemia Without Diabetes

There are many causes of hypoglycemia (Table 345-1). Because hypoglycemia is common in insulin- or insulin secretagogue每treated diabetes, it is often reasonable to assume that a clinically suspicious episode was the result of hypoglycemia. On the other hand, because hypoglycemia is rare in the absence of relevant drug每treated diabetes, it is reasonable to conclude that a hypoglycemic disorder is present only in patients in whom Whipple's triad can be demonstrated.

Particularly in patients who are ill or medicated, the initial diagnostic considerations should focus should on medications, and then critical illnesses, hormone deficiency, or nonislet cell tumor hypoglycemia. In the absence of any of these and in a seemingly well individual, the focus should shift to the possibilities of endogenous hyperinsulinism or accidental, surreptitious, or even malicious hypoglycemia.

Drugs

Insulin and insulin secretagogues suppress glucose production and stimulate glucose utilization. Ethanol blocks gluconeogenesis but not glycogenolysis. Thus, alcohol-induced hypoglycemia typically occurs after a several-day ethanol binge during which the person eats little food, thereby causing glycogen depletion. Ethanol is usually measurable in blood at the time of presentation, but its levels correlate poorly with plasma glucose concentrations. Because gluconeogenesis becomes the predominant route of glucose production during prolonged hypoglycemia, alcohol can contribute to the progression of hypoglycemia in patients with insulin-treated diabetes.

A large number of other drugs have been associated with hypoglycemia. These include commonly used drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists, -adrenergic receptor antagonists, quinolone antibiotics, indomethacin, quinine, and sulfonamides among many others.

Critical Illness

Among hospitalized patients, serious illnesses such as renal, hepatic, or cardiac failure, sepsis, and inanition are second only to drugs as causes of hypoglycemia.

Rapid and extensive hepatic destruction (e.g., toxic hepatitis) causes fasting hypoglycemia because the liver is the major site of endogenous glucose production. The mechanism of hypoglycemia in patients with cardiac failure is unknown. It may involve hepatic congestion and hypoxia. Although the kidneys are a source of glucose production, hypoglycemia in patients with renal failure is also caused by the reduced clearance of insulin and reduced mobilization of gluconeogenic precursors in renal failure.

Sepsis is a relatively common cause of hypoglycemia. Increased glucose utilization is induced by cytokine production in macrophage-rich tissues such as the liver, spleen, and lung. Hypoglycemia develops if glucose production fails to keep pace. Cytokine-induced inhibition of gluconeogenesis in the setting of nutritional glycogen depletion, in combination with hepatic and renal hypoperfusion, may also contribute to hypoglycemia.

Hypoglycemia can be seen with starvation, perhaps because of loss of whole-body fat stores and subsequent depletion of gluconeogenic precursors (e.g., amino acids), necessitating increased glucose utilization.

Hormone Deficiencies

Neither cortisol nor growth hormone is critical to the prevention of hypoglycemia, at least in adults. Nonetheless, hypoglycemia can occur with prolonged fasting in patients with primary adrenocortical failure (Addison's disease) or hypopituitarism. Anorexia and weight loss are typical features of chronic cortisol deficiency and likely result in glycogen depletion. Cortisol deficiency is associated with impaired gluconeogenesis and low levels of gluconeogenic precursors, suggesting that substrate-limited gluconeogenesis, in the setting of glycogen depletion, is the cause of hypoglycemia. Growth hormone deficiency can cause hypoglycemia in young children. In addition to extended fasting, high rates of glucose utilization (e.g., during exercise or in pregnancy) or low rates of glucose production (e.g., following alcohol ingestion) can precipitate hypoglycemia in adults with previously unrecognized hypopituitarism.

Hypoglycemia is not a feature of the epinephrine-deficient state that results from bilateral adrenalectomy, when glucocorticoid replacement is adequate, nor does it occur during pharmacologic adrenergic blockade when other glucoregulatory systems are intact. Combined deficiencies of glucagon and epinephrine play a key role in the pathogenesis of iatrogenic hypoglycemia in people with insulin-deficient diabetes as discussed earlier. Otherwise, deficiencies of these hormones are not usually considered in the differential diagnosis of a hypoglycemic disorder.

Non每Beta-Cell Tumors

Fasting hypoglycemia, often termed non每islet cell tumor hypoglycemia, occurs occasionally in patients with large mesenchymal or epithelial tumors (e.g., hepatomas, adrenocortical carcinomas, carcinoids). The glucose kinetic patterns resemble those of hyperinsulinism (see below), but insulin secretion is suppressed appropriately during hypoglycemia. In most instances, hypoglycemia is due to overproduction of an incompletely processed form of insulin-like growth factor II ("big IGF-II") that does not complex normally with circulating binding proteins and thus more readily gains access to target tissues. The tumors are usually apparent clinically, plasma IGF-II to IGF-I ratios are high and free IGF-II levels [and levels of pro-IGF-II (E1-21)] are elevated. Curative surgery is seldom possible, but reduction of tumor bulk may ameliorate hypoglycemia. Therapy with a glucocorticoid, growth hormone, or both has also been reported to alleviate hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia attributed to ectopic IGF-I production has been reported but is rare.

Endogenous Hyperinsulinism

Hypoglycemia due to endogenous hyperinsulinism can be caused by (1) a primary beta-cell disorder, typically a beta-cell tumor (insulinoma), sometimes multiple insulinomas, or a functional beta-cell disorder with beta-cell hypertrophy or hyperplasia; (2) an antibody to insulin or to the insulin receptor; (3) a beta-cell secretagogue such as a sulfonylurea; or (4) perhaps ectopic insulin secretion among other very rare mechanisms. None of these causes is common.

The fundamental pathophysiologic feature of endogenous hyperinsulinism caused by a primary beta-cell disorder or an insulin secretagogue is the failure of insulin secretion to fall to very low levels during hypoglycemia. This is assessed by measuring plasma insulin, C-peptide (the connecting peptide that is cleaved from proinsulin to produce insulin), proinsulin, and glucose concentrations during hypoglycemia. Insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin levels need not be high relative to normal, euglycemic values; they are inappropriately high in the setting of a low plasma glucose concentration. Critical diagnostic findings are a plasma insulin concentration 3 U/mL (18 pmol/L), a plasma C-peptide concentration 0.6 ng/mL (0.2 nmol/L) and a plasma proinsulin concentration 5.0 pmol/L when the plasma glucose concentration is <55 mg/dL (<3 mmol/L) with symptoms of hypoglycemia. A low plasma -hydroxybutyrate concentration (2.7 mmol/L) and an increment in plasma glucose >25 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) following intravenous glucagon (1 mg) indicate increased insulin (or insulin-like growth factor) actions.

The diagnostic strategy is to obtain measurements of plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin and -hydroxybutyrate concentrations〞and to screen for circulating oral hypoglycemic agents〞during an episode of hypoglycemia and to assess symptoms during the episode and seek their resolution following correction of hypoglycemia by intravenous injection of glucagon (i.e., to document Whipple's triad). This approach is straightforward if the patient is hypoglycemic during evaluation. Since endogenous hyperinsulinemic disorders usually, but not invariably, cause fasting hypoglycemia, a diagnostic episode may develop after a relatively short outpatient fast. Serial sampling during an up to 72-h inpatient diagnostic fast or following a mixed meal is more problematic. An alternative is to give the patient a detailed list of the required measurements and ask them to present to an emergency room, with the list, during a symptomatic episode. Obviously, a normal plasma glucose concentration during a symptomatic episode indicates that the symptoms are not the result of hypoglycemia.

An insulinoma, an insulin-secreting pancreatic islet beta-cell tumor, is the prototypical cause of endogenous hyperinsulinism and, therefore, should be sought in patients with the clinical syndrome. However, insulinoma is not the only cause of endogenous hyperinsulinism. Some patients with fasting endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia have diffuse islet involvement with beta-cell hypertrophy and sometimes hyperplasia. This pattern is commonly referred to as nesidioblastosis, although the finding of beta-cells budding from ducts is not invariably present. Other patients have a similar islet pattern but postprandial hypoglycemia, a disorder termed noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia. Post每gastric bypass postprandial hypoglycemia also involves diffuse islet involvement and endogenous hyperinsulinism. It most often follows Roux en Y gastric bypass. Some have suggested that exaggerated GLP-1 responses to meals may cause hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia, but the pathogenesis has not been clearly established. If medical treatments such as an -glucosidase inhibitor or octreotide fail, partial pancreatectomy may be required. Autoimmune hypoglycemias include those caused by an antibody to insulin, which gradually disassociates, leading to late postprandial hypoglycemia. Alternatively, an insulin receptor antibody can function as an agonist. The presence of an insulin secretagogue, such as a sulfonylurea or a glinide, results in a clinical and biochemical pattern similar to that of an insulinoma but can be distinguished by the presence of the circulating secretagogue. Finally, very rare phenomena include ectopic insulin secretion, a gain of function insulin receptor mutation, and exercise-induced hyperinsulinemia.

Insulinomas are uncommon〞the yearly incidence is estimated to be 1 in 250,000〞but because more than 90% are benign, they are a treatable cause of potentially fatal hypoglycemia. The median age at presentation is 50 years in sporadic cases, but it usually presents in the third decade when it is a component of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (Chap. 351). More than 99% of insulinomas are within the substance of the pancreas and they are usually small (90% <2.0 cm). Therefore, they come to clinical attention because of hypoglycemia rather than mass effects. CT or MRI detects approximately 70每80% of insulinomas. These methods detect metastases in the roughly 10% of patients with a malignant insulinoma. Transabdominal ultrasound will often identify insulinomas, and endoscopic ultrasound has a sensitivity of about 90%. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy is thought to detect insulinomas in about half of patients. Selective pancreatic arterial calcium injections, with the endpoint of a sharp increase in hepatic venous insulin levels, regionalizes insulinomas with high sensitivity, but this invasive procedure is seldom necessary except to confirm endogenous hyperinsulinism in the diffuse islet disorders. Intraoperative pancreatic ultrasonography almost invariably localizes insulinomas that are not readily palpable by the surgeon. Surgical resection of a solitary insulinoma is generally curative. Diazoxide, which inhibits insulin secretion, or the somatostatin analogue octreotide can be used to treat hypoglycemia in patients with unresectable tumors; everolimus, an mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor, is promising.

Accidental, Surreptitious or Malicious Hypoglycemia

Accidental ingestion of an insulin secretagogue (e.g., the result of a pharmacy or other medical error), or administration of insulin, can occur. Factitious hypoglycemia, caused by surreptitious or even malicious administration of insulin or an insulin secretagogue, shares many clinical and laboratory features with insulinoma. It is most common among health care workers, patients with diabetes or their relatives, and people with a history of other factitious illnesses. However, it should be considered in all patients being evaluated for hypoglycemia of obscure cause. Ingestion of an insulin secretagogue causes hypoglycemia with increased C-peptide levels whereas exogenous insulin causes hypoglycemia with low C-peptide levels, reflecting suppression of insulin secretion.

Analytical error in the measurement of plasma glucose concentrations is rare. On the other hand, glucose monitors used to guide treatment of diabetes are not quantitative instruments, particularly at low glucose levels, and these should not be used for the definitive diagnosis of hypoglycemia. Even with a quantitative method, low measured glucose concentrations can be artifactual, e.g., the result of continued glucose metabolism by the formed elements of the blood ex vivo, particularly in the presence of leukocytosis, erythrocytosis, or thrombocytosis, or if separation of the serum from the formed elements is delayed (pseudohypoglycemia).

Approach to the Patient: Hypoglycemia

In addition to recognition and documentation of hypoglycemia, and often urgent treatment, diagnosis of the hypoglycemic mechanism is critical for choosing a treatment that prevents, or at least minimizes, recurrent hypoglycemia.

Recognition and Documentation

Hypoglycemia is suspected in patients with typical symptoms; in the presence of confusion, an altered level of consciousness, or a seizure; or in a clinical setting in which hypoglycemia is known to occur. Blood should be drawn, whenever possible, before the administration of glucose to allow documentation of a low plasma glucose concentration. Convincing documentation of hypoglycemia requires the fulfillment of Whipple's triad. Thus, the ideal time to measure the plasma glucose level is during a symptomatic episode. A normal glucose level excludes hypoglycemia as the cause of the symptoms. A low glucose level confirms that hypoglycemia is the cause of the symptoms, provided the latter resolve after the glucose level is raised. When the cause of the hypoglycemic episode is obscure, additional measurements, while the glucose level is low and before treatment, should include plasma insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin and -hydroxybutyrate levels, as well as screening for circulating oral hypoglycemic agents, and symptoms should be assessed during and after the plasma glucose concentration is raised.

When the history suggests prior hypoglycemia, and a potential mechanism is not apparent, the diagnostic strategy is to measure these values, and assess for Whipple's triad, during and after an episode of hypoglycemia. On the other hand, while it cannot be ignored, a distinctly low plasma glucose concentration measured in a patient without corresponding symptoms raises the possibility of an artifact (pseudohypoglycemia).

Diagnosis of the Hypoglycemic Mechanism

In a patient with documented hypoglycemia, a plausible hypoglycemic mechanism can often be deduced from the history, physical examination, and available laboratory data (Table 345-1). Drugs, particularly those used to treat diabetes or alcohol, should be the first consideration, even in the absence of known use of a relevant drug, given the possibility of surreptitious, accidental, or malicious drug administration. Other considerations include evidence of a relevant critical illness, less commonly hormone deficiencies, and rarely a non每beta-cell tumor that can be pursued diagnostically. Absent one of these mechanisms, in an otherwise seemingly well individual, one should consider endogenous hyperinsulinism and proceed with measurements and assessment of symptoms during spontaneous hypoglycemia or under conditions that might elicit hypoglycemia.

Urgent Treatment

Oral treatment with glucose tablets or glucose-containing fluids, candy, or food is appropriate if the patient is able and willing to take these. A reasonable initial dose is 20 g of glucose. If the patient is unable or unwilling, because of neuroglycopenia, to take carbohydrates orally, parenteral therapy is necessary. Intravenous glucose (25 g) should be given and followed by a glucose infusion guided by serial plasma glucose measurements. If intravenous therapy is not practical, subcutaneous or intramuscular glucagon (1.0 mg in adults) can be used, particularly in patients with T1DM. Because it acts by stimulating glycogenolysis, glucagon is ineffective in glycogen-depleted individuals (e.g., those with alcohol-induced hypoglycemia). It also stimulates insulin secretion and is therefore less useful in T2DM. These treatments raise plasma glucose concentrations only transiently, and patients should therefore be urged to eat as soon as is practical to replete glycogen stores.

Prevention of Recurrent Hypoglycemia

Prevention of recurrent hypoglycemia requires an understanding of the hypoglycemic mechanism. Offending drugs can be discontinued or their doses reduced. Hypoglycemia caused by a sulfonylurea can persist for hours, or even days. Underlying critical illnesses can often be treated. Cortisol and growth hormone can be replaced if they are deficient. Surgical, radiotherapeutic, or chemotherapeutic reduction of a nonislet cell tumor can alleviate hypoglycemia even if the tumor cannot be cured; glucocorticoid or growth hormone administration also may reduce hypoglycemic episodes in such patients. Surgical resection of an insulinoma is curative; medical therapy with diazoxide or octreotide can be used if resection is not possible and in patients with a nontumor beta-cell disorder. Partial pancreatectomy may be necessary in the latter patients. The treatment of autoimmune hypoglycemia (e.g., with a glucocorticoid or immunosuppressive drugs) is problematic, but the disorders are sometimes self-limited. Failing these treatments, frequent feedings and avoidance of fasting may be required. Administration of uncooked cornstarch at bedtime or even an overnight intragastric infusion of glucose may be necessary in some patients.

Chapter 346. Disorders of the Testes and Male Reproductive System >
 

Disorders of the Testes and Male Reproductive System: Introduction

The male reproductive system regulates sex differentiation, virilization, and the hormonal changes that accompany puberty, ultimately leading to spermatogenesis and fertility. Under the control of the pituitary hormones〞luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)〞the Leydig cells of the testes produce testosterone and germ cells are nurtured by Sertoli cells to divide, differentiate, and mature into sperm. During embryonic development, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) induce the wolffian duct and virilization of the external genitalia. During puberty, testosterone promotes somatic growth and the development of secondary sex characteristics. In adults, testosterone is necessary for spermatogenesis, stimulation of libido, normal sexual function, and maintenance of muscle and bone mass. This chapter focuses on the physiology of the testes and disorders associated with decreased androgen production, which may be caused by gonadotropin deficiency or primary testis dysfunction. A variety of testosterone formulations now allow more physiologic androgen replacement. Infertility occurs in 5% of men and is increasingly amenable to treatment by hormone replacement or by using sperm transfer techniques. For further discussion of sexual dysfunction, disorders of the prostate, and testicular cancer, see Chaps. 48, 95, and 96, respectively.
 
Development and Structure of the Testis

The fetal testis develops from the undifferentiated gonad after expression of a genetic cascade that is initiated by the SRY (sex-related gene on the Y chromosome) (Chap. 349). SRY induces differentiation of Sertoli cells, which surround germ cells and, together with peritubular myoid cells, form testis cords that later develop into seminiferous tubules. Fetal Leydig cells and endothelial cells migrate into the gonad from the adjacent mesonephros but also may arise from interstitial cells that reside between testis cords. Leydig cells produce testosterone, which supports the growth and differentiation of wolffian duct structures that develop into the epididymis, vas deferens, and seminal vesicles. Testosterone is also converted to DHT (see below), which induces formation of the prostate and the external male genitalia, including the penis, urethra, and scrotum. Testicular descent through the inguinal canal is controlled in part by Leydig cell production of insulin-like factor 3 (INSL3), which acts via a receptor termed LGR8 (leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein每coupled receptor 8, also known as GREAT: G protein每coupled receptor affecting testis descent). Sertoli cells produce m邦llerian inhibiting substance (MIS), which causes regression of the m邦llerian structures, including the fallopian tube, uterus, and upper segment of the vagina.
 
Normal Male Pubertal Development

Although puberty commonly refers to the maturation of the reproductive axis and the development of secondary sex characteristics, it involves a coordinated response of multiple hormonal systems that include the adrenal gland and the growth hormone (GH) axis (Fig. 346-1). The development of secondary sex characteristics is initiated by adrenarche, which usually occurs between 6 and 8 years of age when the adrenal gland begins to produce greater amounts of androgens from the zona reticularis, the principal site of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) production. The sex maturation process is greatly accelerated by the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and the production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). The GnRH pulse generator in the hypothalamus is active during fetal life and early infancy but is restrained until the early stages of puberty by a neuroendocrine brake imposed by the inhibitory actions of glutamate, -amino butyric acid (GABA), and neuropeptide Y. Although the pathways that initiate reactivation of the GnRH pulse generator at the onset of puberty have been elusive, mounting evidence supports involvement of GPR54, a G protein每coupled receptor that binds an endogenous ligand, kisspeptin. Individuals with mutations of GPR54 fail to enter puberty, and experiments in primates demonstrate that infusion of kisspeptin is sufficient to induce premature puberty. Kisspeptin signaling plays an important role in mediating the feedback action of sex steroids on gonadotropin secretion and in regulating the tempo of sexual maturation at puberty. Leptin, a hormone produced by adipose cells, plays a permissive role in the resurgence of GnRH secretion at the onset of puberty, as leptin-deficient individuals also fail to enter puberty (Chap. 77).

The early stages of puberty are characterized by nocturnal surges of LH and FSH. Growth of the testes is usually the first sign of puberty, reflecting an increase in seminiferous tubule volume. Increasing levels of testosterone deepen the voice and increase muscle growth. Conversion of testosterone to DHT leads to growth of the external genitalia and pubic hair. DHT also stimulates prostate and facial hair growth and initiates recession of the temporal hairline. The growth spurt occurs at a testicular volume of about 10每12 mL. GH increases early in puberty and is stimulated in part by the rise in gonadal steroids. GH increases the level of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), which enhances linear bone growth. The prolonged pubertal exposure to gonadal steroids (mainly estradiol) ultimately causes epiphyseal closure and limits further bone growth.
 
Regulation of Testicular Function

Regulation of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Testis Axis in Adult Men

Hypothalamic GnRH regulates the production of the pituitary gonadotropins LH and FSH (Fig. 346-2). GnRH is released in discrete pulses approximately every 2 hours, resulting in corresponding pulses of LH and FSH. These dynamic hormone pulses account in part for the wide variations in LH and testosterone even within the same individual. LH acts primarily on the Leydig cell to stimulate testosterone synthesis. The regulatory control of androgen synthesis is mediated by testosterone and estrogen feedback on both the hypothalamus and the pituitary. FSH acts on the Sertoli cell to regulate spermatogenesis and the production of Sertoli products such as inhibin B, which acts to suppress pituitary FSH selectively. Despite these somewhat distinct Leydig and Sertoli cell每regulated pathways, testis function is integrated at several levels: GnRH regulates both gonadotropins; spermatogenesis requires high levels of testosterone; numerous paracrine interactions between Leydig and Sertoli cells are necessary for normal testis function.

The Leydig Cell: Androgen Synthesis

LH binds to its seven transmembrane, G protein每coupled receptor to activate the cyclic AMP pathway. Stimulation of the LH receptor induces steroid acute regulatory (StAR) protein, along with several steroidogenic enzymes involved in androgen synthesis. LH receptor mutations cause Leydig cell hypoplasia or agenesis, underscoring the importance of this pathway for Leydig cell development and function. The rate-limiting process in testosterone synthesis is the delivery of cholesterol by the StAR protein to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, a mitochondrial cholesterol-binding protein, is also an acute regulator of Leydig cell steroidogenesis. The five major enzymatic steps involved in testosterone synthesis are summarized in Fig. 346-3. After cholesterol transport into the mitochondrion, the formation of pregnenolone by CYP11A1 (side chain cleavage enzyme) is a limiting enzymatic step. The 17-hydroxylase and the 17,20-lyase reactions are catalyzed by a single enzyme, CYP17; posttranslational modification (phosphorylation) of this enzyme and the presence of specific enzyme cofactors confer 17,20-lyase activity selectively in the testis and zona reticularis of the adrenal gland. Testosterone can be converted to the more potent DHT by 5-reductase, or it can be aromatized to estradiol by CYP19 (aromatase). Two isoforms of steroid 5-reductase, SRD5A1 and SRD5A2, have been described; all known individuals with clinical features of 5-reductase deficiency have mutations in SRD5A2, the predominant form in the prostate and the skin.

Testosterone Transport and Metabolism

In males, 95% of circulating testosterone is derived from testicular production (3每10 mg/d). Direct secretion of testosterone by the adrenal and peripheral conversion of androstenedione to testosterone collectively account for another 0.5 mg/d of testosterone. Only a small amount of DHT (70 g/d) is secreted directly by the testis; most circulating DHT is derived from peripheral conversion of testosterone. Most of the daily production of estradiol (approximately 45 g/d) in men is derived from aromatase-mediated peripheral conversion of testosterone and androstenedione.

Circulating testosterone is bound to two plasma proteins: sex hormone每binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin (Fig. 346-4). SHBG binds testosterone with much greater affinity than albumin. Only 0.5每3% of testosterone is unbound. According to the "free hormone" hypothesis, only the unbound fraction is biologically active; however, albumin-bound hormone dissociates readily in the capillaries and may be bioavailable. SHBG concentrations are decreased by androgens, obesity, diabetes mellitus, insulin, and nephrotic syndrome. Conversely, estrogen administration, hyperthyroidism, many chronic inflammatory illnesses, and aging are associated with high SHBG concentrations.

Testosterone is metabolized predominantly in the liver, although some degradation occurs in peripheral tissues, particularly the prostate and the skin. In the liver, testosterone is converted by a series of enzymatic steps that involve 5- and 5-reductases, 3- and 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, and 17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase into androsterone, etiocholanolone, DHT, and 3--androstanediol. These compounds undergo glucuronidation or sulfation before being excreted by the kidneys.

Mechanism of Androgen Action

The androgen receptor (AR) is structurally related to the nuclear receptors for estrogen, glucocorticoids, and progesterone (Chap. 338). The AR is encoded by a gene on the long arm of the X chromosome and has a molecular mass of about 110 kDa. A polymorphic region in the amino terminus of the receptor, which contains a variable number of glutamine repeats, modifies the transcriptional activity of the receptor. The AR protein is distributed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Ligand binding to the AR induces conformational changes that allow the recruitment and assembly of tissue-specific cofactors and causes it to translocate into the nucleus, where it binds to DNA or other transcription factors already bound to DNA. Thus, the AR is a ligand-regulated transcription factor. Some androgen effects may be mediated by nongenomic AR signal transduction pathways. Testosterone binds to AR with one-half the affinity of DHT. The DHT-AR complex also has greater thermostability and a slower dissociation rate than the testosterone-AR complex. However, the molecular basis for selective testosterone versus DHT actions has not been explained completely.

The Seminiferous Tubules: Spermatogenesis

The seminiferous tubules are convoluted, closed loops with both ends emptying into the rete testis, a network of progressively larger efferent ducts that ultimately form the epididymis (Fig. 346-2). The seminiferous tubules total about 600 m in length and account for about two-thirds of testis volume. The walls of the tubules are formed by polarized Sertoli cells that are apposed to peritubular myoid cells. Tight junctions between Sertoli cells create a blood-testis barrier. Germ cells constitute the majority of the seminiferous epithelium (60%) and are intimately embedded within the cytoplasmic extensions of the Sertoli cells, which function as "nurse cells." Germ cells progress through characteristic stages of mitotic and meiotic divisions. A pool of type A spermatogonia serve as stem cells capable of self-renewal. Primary spermatocytes are derived from type B spermatogonia and undergo meiosis before progressing to spermatids that undergo spermiogenesis (a differentiation process involving chromatin condensation, acquisition of an acrosome, elongation of cytoplasm, and formation of a tail) and are released from Sertoli cells as mature spermatozoa. The complete differentiation process into mature sperm requires 74 days. Peristaltic-type action by peritubular myoid cells transports sperm into the efferent ducts. The spermatozoa spend an additional 21 days in the epididymis, where they undergo further maturation and capacitation. The normal adult testes produce >100 million sperm per day.

Naturally occurring mutations in the FSHb gene and the FSH receptor confirm an important, but not essential, role for this pathway in spermatogenesis. Females with these mutations are hypogonadal and infertile because ovarian follicles do not mature; males exhibit variable degrees of reduced spermatogenesis, presumably because of impaired Sertoli cell function. Because Sertoli cells produce inhibin B, an inhibitor of FSH, seminiferous tubule damage (e.g., by radiation) causes a selective increase of FSH. Testosterone reaches very high concentrations locally in the testis and is essential for spermatogenesis. The cooperative actions of FSH and testosterone are important in the progression of meiosis and spermiation. FSH and testosterone regulate germ cell survival via intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic mechanisms. FSH also may play an important role in supporting spermatogonia. Gonadotropin-regulated testicular RNA helicase (GRTH/DDX25), a testis-specific gonadotropin/androgen-regulated RNA helicase, is present in germ cells and Leydig cells and may participate in paracrine regulation of germ cell development.

A number of knockout mouse models exhibit impaired germ cell development or spermatogenesis, presaging possible mutations associated with male infertility. The human Y chromosome contains a small pseudoautosomal region that can recombine with homologous regions of the X chromosome. Most of the Y chromosome does not recombine with the X chromosome and is referred to as the male-specific region of the Y (MSY). The MSY contains 156 transcription units that encode for 26 proteins, including nine families of Y-specific multicopy genes; many of these Y-specific genes are also testis-specific and necessary for spermatogenesis. Microdeletions of several Y chromosome azoospermia factor (AZF) genes (e.g., RNA-binding motif, RBM; deleted in azoospermia, DAZ) are associated with oligospermia or azoospermia.

Treatment: Male Factor Infertility

Treatment options for male factor infertility have expanded greatly in recent years. Secondary hypogonadism is highly amenable to treatment with gonadotropins (see below). Assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) have provided new opportunities for patients with male factor infertility primary testicular failure and disorders of sperm transport. Choice of initial treatment options depends on sperm concentration and motility. Expectant management should be attempted initially in men with mild male factor infertility (sperm count 15每20 x 106/mL and normal motility). Moderate male factor infertility (10每15 x 106/mL and 20每40% motility) should begin with intrauterine insemination alone or in combination with treatment of the female partner with clomiphene or gonadotropins, but it may require IVF with or without ICSI. For men with a severe defect (sperm count <10 x 106/mL, 10% motility), IVF with ICSI or donor sperm should be used.
 
Clinical and Laboratory Evaluation of Male Reproductive Function

History and Physical Examination

The history should focus on developmental stages such as puberty and growth spurts, as well as androgen-dependent events such as early-morning erections, frequency and intensity of sexual thoughts, and frequency of masturbation or intercourse. Although libido and the overall frequency of sexual acts are decreased in androgen-deficient men, young hypogonadal men may achieve erections in response to visual erotic stimuli. Men with acquired androgen deficiency often report decreased energy and increased irritability.

The physical examination should focus on secondary sex characteristics such as hair growth, gynecomastia, testicular volume, prostate, and height and body proportions. Eunuchoid proportions are defined as an arm span >2 cm greater than height and suggest that androgen deficiency occurred before epiphyseal fusion. Hair growth on the face, axilla, chest, and pubic regions is androgen-dependent; however, changes may not be noticeable unless androgen deficiency is severe and prolonged. Ethnicity also influences the intensity of hair growth (Chap. 49). Testicular volume is best assessed by using a Prader orchidometer. Testes range from 3.5 to 5.5 cm in length, which corresponds to a volume of 12每25 mL. Advanced age does not influence testicular size, although the consistency becomes less firm. Asian men generally have smaller testes than Western Europeans, independent of differences in body size. Because of its possible role in infertility, the presence of varicocele should be sought by palpation while the patient is standing; it is more common on the left side. Patients with Klinefelter's syndrome have markedly reduced testicular volumes (1每2 mL). In congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, testicular volumes provide a good index for the degree of gonadotropin deficiency and the likelihood of response to therapy.

Gonadotropin and Inhibin Measurements

LH and FSH are measured by using two-site immunoradiometric, immunofluorometric, or chemiluminescent assays, which have very low cross-reactivity with other pituitary glycoprotein hormones and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and have sufficient sensitivity to measure the low levels present in patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. In men with a low testosterone level, an LH level can distinguish primary (high LH) from secondary (low or inappropriately normal LH) hypogonadism. An elevated LH level indicates a primary defect at the testicular level, whereas a low or inappropriately normal LH level suggests a defect at the hypothalamic-pituitary level. LH pulses occur about every 1每3 hours in normal men. Thus, gonadotropin levels fluctuate, and samples should be pooled or repeated when results are equivocal. FSH is less pulsatile than LH because it has a longer half-life. Selective increase in FSH suggests damage to the seminiferous tubules. Inhibin B, a Sertoli cell product that suppresses FSH, is reduced with seminiferous tubule damage. Inhibin B is a dimer with -B subunits and is measured by two-site immunoassays.

GnRH Stimulation Testing

The GnRH test is performed by measuring LH and FSH concentrations at baseline and at 30 and 60 minutes after intravenous administration of 100 g of GnRH. A minimally acceptable response is a twofold LH increase and a 50% FSH increase. In the prepubertal period or with severe GnRH deficiency, the gonadotrope may not respond to a single bolus of GnRH because it has not been primed by endogenous hypothalamic GnRH. With the advent of highly sensitive gonadotropin assays, this test is rarely used in practice.

Testosterone Assays

Total Testosterone

Total testosterone includes both unbound and protein-bound testosterone and is measured by radioimmunoassays, immunometric assays, or liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). LC-MS/MS involves extraction of serum by organic solvents, separation of testosterone from other steroids by high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, and quantitation of unique testosterone fragments by mass spectrometry. LC-MS/MS provides accurate and sensitive measurements of testosterone levels even in the low range and is emerging as the method of choice for testosterone measurement. A single random sample provides a good approximation of the average testosterone concentration with the realization that testosterone levels fluctuate in response to pulsatile LH. Testosterone is generally lower in the late afternoon and is reduced by acute illness. The testosterone concentration in healthy young men ranges from 300 to 1000 ng/dL in most laboratories, although these reference ranges are not derived from population-based random samples. Alterations in SHBG levels due to aging, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, some types of medications, or chronic illness or on a congenital basis can affect total testosterone levels. Heritable factors contribute substantially to the population-level variation in testosterone levels. Genomewide association studies have revealed polymorphisms in the SHBG gene as important contributors to variation in testosterone levels.

Measurement of Unbound Testosterone Levels

Most circulating testosterone is bound to SHBG and to albumin; only 0.5每3% of circulating testosterone is unbound, or "free." The unbound testosterone concentration can be measured by equilibrium dialysis or calculated from total testosterone, SHBG, and albumin concentrations by using published mass-action equations. Tracer analogue methods are relatively inexpensive and convenient but are inaccurate. Bioavailable testosterone refers to unbound testosterone plus testosterone that is loosely bound to albumin; it can be measured by the ammonium sulfate precipitation method.

HCG Stimulation Test

The hCG stimulation test is performed by administering a single injection of 1500每4000 IU of hCG intramuscularly and measuring testosterone levels at baseline and 24, 48, 72, and 120 hours after hCG injection. An alternative regimen involves three injections of 1500 units of hCG on successive days and measurement of testosterone levels 24 hours after the last dose. An acceptable response to hCG is a doubling of the testosterone concentration in adult men. In prepubertal boys, an increase in testosterone to >150 ng/dL indicates the presence of testicular tissue. No response may indicate an absence of testicular tissue or marked impairment of Leydig cell function. Measurement of MIS, a Sertoli cell product, is also used to detect the presence of testes in prepubertal boys with cryptorchidism.

Semen Analysis

Semen analysis is the most important step in the evaluation of male infertility. Samples are collected by masturbation after a period of abstinence of 2每3 days. Semen volumes and sperm concentrations vary considerably among fertile men, and several samples may be needed before it is possible to conclude that the results are abnormal. Analysis should be performed within an hour of collection. The normal ejaculate volume is 2每6 mL and contains sperm counts >20 million/mL, with a motility of >50% and >15% normal morphology. Some men with low sperm counts are nevertheless fertile. A variety of tests for sperm function can be performed in specialized laboratories, but they add relatively little to the treatment options.

Testicular Biopsy

Testicular biopsy is useful in some patients with oligospermia or azoospermia as an aid in diagnosis and an indication for the feasibility of treatment. Using local anesthesia, fine-needle aspiration biopsy is performed to aspirate tissue for histology. Alternatively, open biopsies can be performed under local or general anesthesia when more tissue is required. A normal biopsy in an azoospermic man with a normal FSH level suggests obstruction of the vas deferens, which may be correctable surgically. Biopsies are also used to harvest sperm for ICSI and to classify disorders such as hypospermatogenesis (all stages present but in reduced numbers), germ cell arrest (usually at primary spermatocyte stage), and Sertoli cell每only syndrome (absent germ cells) or hyalinization (sclerosis with absent cellular elements).
 
Disorders of Sexual Differentiation

See Chap. 349.
 
Disorders of Puberty

The onset and tempo of puberty vary greatly in the general population and are affected by genetic and environmental factors. Although some of the variance in the timing of puberty is explained by heritable factors, the genes involved, and their relative contributions to the timing of puberty are not known.

Precocious Puberty

Puberty in boys before age 9 is considered precocious. Isosexual precocity refers to premature sexual development consistent with phenotypic sex and includes features such as the development of facial hair and phallic growth. Isosexual precocity is divided into gonadotropin-dependent and gonadotropin-independent causes of androgen excess (Table 346-1). Heterosexual precocity refers to the premature development of estrogenic features in boys such as breast development.

Gonadotropin-Dependent Precocious Puberty

This disorder, called central precocious puberty (CPP), is less common in boys than in girls. It is caused by premature activation of the GnRH pulse generator, sometimes because of central nervous system (CNS) lesions such as hypothalamic hamartomas, but it is often idiopathic. CPP is characterized by gonadotropin levels that are inappropriately elevated for age. Because pituitary priming has occurred, GnRH elicits LH and FSH responses typical of those seen in puberty or in adults. MRI should be performed to exclude a mass, structural defect, infection, or inflammatory process.

Gonadotropin-Independent Precocious Puberty

In these disorders, androgens from the testis or the adrenal are increased but gonadotropins are low. This group of disorders includes hCG-secreting tumors; congenital adrenal hyperplasia; sex steroid每producing tumors of the testis, adrenal, and ovary; accidental or deliberate exogenous sex steroid administration; hypothyroidism; and activating mutations of the LH receptor or GS subunit.

Familial Male-Limited Precocious Puberty

Also called testotoxicosis, familial male-limited precocious puberty is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by activating mutations in the LH receptor, leading to constitutive stimulation of the cyclic AMP pathway and testosterone production. Clinical features include premature androgenization in boys, growth acceleration in early childhood, and advanced bone age followed by premature epiphyseal fusion. Testosterone is elevated, and LH is suppressed. Treatment options include inhibitors of testosterone synthesis (e.g., ketoconazole), androgen receptor antagonists (e.g., flutamide and bicalutamide), and aromatase inhibitors (e.g., anastrazole).

Mccune-Albright Syndrome

This is a sporadic disorder caused by somatic (postzygotic) activating mutations in the GS subunit that links G protein每coupled receptors to intracellular signaling pathways (Chap. 355). The mutations impair the guanosine triphosphatase activity of the GS protein, leading to constitutive activation of adenylyl cyclase. Like activating LH receptor mutations, this stimulates testosterone production and causes gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty. In addition to sexual precocity, affected individuals may have autonomy in the adrenals, pituitary, and thyroid glands. Caf谷 au lait spots are characteristic skin lesions that reflect the onset of the somatic mutations in melanocytes during embryonic development. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia is caused by activation of the parathyroid hormone receptor pathway in bone. Treatment is similar to that in patients with activating LH receptor mutations. Bisphosphonates have been used to treat bone lesions.

Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia

Boys with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) who are not well controlled with glucocorticoid suppression of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) can develop premature virilization because of excessive androgen production by the adrenal gland (Chaps. 342 and 349). LH is low, and the testes are small. Adrenal rests may develop within the testis of poorly controlled patients with CAH because of chronic ACTH stimulation; adrenal rests do not require surgical removal and regress with effective glucocorticoid therapy. Some children with CAH may develop gonadotropin-dependent precocious puberty with early maturation of the hypothalamic- pituitary-gonadal axis, elevated gonadotropins, and testicular growth.

Heterosexual Sexual Precocity

Breast enlargement in prepubertal boys can result from familial aromatase excess, estrogen-producing tumors in the adrenal gland, Sertoli cell tumors in the testis, marijuana smoking, or exogenous estrogens or androgens. Occasionally, germ cell tumors that secrete hCG can be associated with breast enlargement due to excessive stimulation of estrogen production (see "Gynecomastia," below).

Approach to the Patient: Precocious Puberty

After verification of precocious development, serum LH and FSH levels should be measured to determine whether gonadotropins are increased in relation to chronologic age (gonadotropin-dependent) or whether sex steroid secretion is occurring independent of LH and FSH (gonadotropin-independent). In children with gonadotropin-dependent precocious puberty, CNS lesions should be excluded by history, neurologic examination, and MRI scan of the head. If organic causes are not found, one is left with the diagnosis of idiopathic central precocity. Patients with high testosterone but suppressed LH concentrations have gonadotropin-independent sexual precocity; in these patients, DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) and 17-hydroxyprogesterone should be measured. High levels of testosterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone suggest the possibility of CAH due to 21-hydroxylase or 11-hydroxylase deficiency. If testosterone and DHEAS are elevated, adrenal tumors should be excluded by obtaining a CT scan of the adrenal glands. Patients with elevated testosterone but without increased 17-hydroxyprogesterone or DHEAS should undergo careful evaluation of the testis by palpation and ultrasound to exclude a Leydig cell neoplasm. Activating mutations of the LH receptor should be considered in children with gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty in whom CAH, androgen abuse, and adrenal and testicular neoplasms have been excluded.

Precocious Puberty

In patients with a known cause (e.g., a CNS lesion or a testicular tumor), therapy should be directed toward the underlying disorder. In patients with idiopathic CPP, long-acting GnRH analogues can be used to suppress gonadotropins and decrease testosterone, halt early pubertal development, delay accelerated bone maturation, and prevent early epiphyseal closure, thus increasing final height and mitigating the psychosocial consequences of early pubertal development. The treatment is most effective for increasing final adult height if it is initiated before age 6. Puberty resumes after discontinuation of the GnRH analogue. Counseling is an important aspect of the overall treatment strategy.

In children with gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty, inhibitors of steroidogenesis such as ketoconazole, and AR antagonists have been used empirically. Long-term treatment with spironolactone (a weak androgen antagonist) and ketoconazole has been reported to normalize growth rate and bone maturation and to improve predicted height in small, nonrandomized trials in boys with familial male-limited precocious puberty. Aromatase inhibitors such as testolactone and letrozole have been used as an adjunct to antiandrogen and GnRH analogue therapy for children with familial male-limited precocious puberty, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and McCune-Albright syndrome.

Delayed Puberty

Puberty is delayed in boys if it has not ensued by age 14, an age that is 2每2.5 standard deviations above the mean for healthy children. Delayed puberty is more common in boys than in girls. There are four main categories of delayed puberty: (1) constitutional delay of growth and puberty (60% of cases), (2) functional hypogonadotropic hypogonadism caused by systemic illness or malnutrition (20% of cases), (3) hypogonadotropic hypogonadism caused by genetic or acquired defects in the hypothalamic-pituitary region (10% of cases), and (4) hypergonadotropic hypogonadism secondary to primary gonadal failure (15% of cases) (Table 346-1). Functional hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is more common in girls than in boys. Permanent causes of hypogonadotropic or hypergonadotropic hypogonadism are identified in <25% of boys with delayed puberty.

Approach to the Patient: Delayed Puberty

Any history of systemic illness, eating disorders, excessive exercise, social and psychological problems, and abnormal patterns of linear growth during childhood should be verified. Boys with pubertal delay may have accompanying emotional and physical immaturity relative to their peers, which can be a source of anxiety. Physical examination should focus on height; arm span; weight; visual fields; and secondary sex characteristics, including hair growth, testicular volume, phallic size, and scrotal reddening and thinning. Testicular size >2.5 cm generally indicates that the child has entered puberty.

The main diagnostic challenge is to distinguish those with constitutional delay, who will progress through puberty at a later age, from those with an underlying pathologic process. Constitutional delay should be suspected when there is a family history and when there are delayed bone age and short stature. Pituitary priming by pulsatile GnRH is required before LH and FSH are synthesized and secreted normally. Thus, blunted responses to exogenous GnRH can be seen in patients with constitutional delay, GnRH deficiency, or pituitary disorders (see "GnRH Stimulation Testing," above). In contrast, low-normal basal gonadotropin levels or a normal response to exogenous GnRH is consistent with an early stage of puberty, which often is heralded by nocturnal GnRH secretion. Thus, constitutional delay is a diagnosis of exclusion that requires ongoing evaluation until the onset of puberty and the growth spurt.

Treatment: Delayed Puberty

If therapy is considered appropriate, it can begin with 25每50 mg testosterone enanthate or testosterone cypionate every 2 weeks or by using a 2.5-mg testosterone patch or 25-mg testosterone gel. Because aromatization of testosterone to estrogen is obligatory for mediating androgen effects on epiphyseal fusion, concomitant treatment with aromatase inhibitors may allow attainment of greater final adult height. Testosterone treatment should be interrupted after 6 months to determine whether endogenous LH and FSH secretion has ensued. Other causes of delayed puberty should be considered when there are associated clinical features or when boys do not enter puberty spontaneously after a year of observation or treatment.

Reassurance without hormonal treatment is appropriate for many individuals with presumed constitutional delay of puberty. However, the impact of delayed growth and pubertal progression on a child's social relationships and school performance should be weighed. Also, boys with constitutional delay of puberty are less likely to achieve their full genetic height potential and have reduced total body bone mass as adults, mainly due to narrow limb bones and vertebrae as a result of impaired periosteal expansion during puberty. Administration of androgen therapy to boys with constitutional delay does not affect final height, and when administered with an aromatase inhibitor, it may improve final height.
 
Disorders of the Male Reproductive Axis during Adulthood

Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism

Because LH and FSH are trophic hormones for the testes, impaired secretion of these pituitary gonadotropins results in secondary hypogonadism, which is characterized by low testosterone in the setting of low LH and FSH. Those with the most severe deficiency have complete absence of pubertal development, sexual infantilism, and, in some cases, hypospadias and undescended testes. Patients with partial gonadotropin deficiency have delayed or arrested sex development. The 24-hour LH secretory profiles are heterogeneous in patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, reflecting variable abnormalities of LH pulse frequency or amplitude. In severe cases, basal LH is low and there are no LH pulses. A smaller subset of patients has low-amplitude LH pulses or markedly reduced pulse frequency. Occasionally, only sleep-entrained LH pulses occur, reminiscent of the pattern seen in the early stages of puberty. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism can be classified into congenital and acquired disorders. Congenital disorders most commonly involve GnRH deficiency, which leads to gonadotropin deficiency. Acquired disorders are more common than congenital disorders and may result from a variety of sellar mass lesions or infiltrative diseases of the hypothalamus or pituitary.

Congenital Disorders Associated with Gonadotropin Deficiency

Most cases of congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism are idiopathic despite extensive endocrine testing and imaging studies of the sellar region. Among known causes, familial hypogonadotropic hypogonadism can be transmitted as an X-linked (20%), autosomal recessive (30%), or autosomal dominant (50%) trait. Some individuals with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) have sporadic mutations in the same genes that cause inherited forms of the disorder (Table 346-2). Kallmann's syndrome is an X-linked disorder caused by mutations in the KAL1 gene, which encodes anosmin, a protein that mediates the migration of neural progenitors of the olfactory bulb and GnRH-producing neurons. These individuals have GnRH deficiency and variable combinations of anosmia or hyposmia, renal defects, and neurologic abnormalities, including mirror movements. Gonadotropin secretion and fertility can be restored by administration of pulsatile GnRH or gonadotropin replacement. Mutations in the FGFR1 gene cause an autosomal dominant form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism that clinically resembles Kallmann's syndrome; mutations in its putative ligand, theFGF8 gene product, have also been associated with IHH. Prokineticin 2 (PROK2) also encodes a protein involved in migration and development of olfactory and GnRH neurons. Recessive mutations in PROK2 or in its receptor, PROKR2, have been associated with both anosmic and normosmic forms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. X-linked hypogonadotropic hypogonadism also occurs in adrenal hypoplasia congenita, a disorder caused by mutations in the DAX1 gene, which encodes a nuclear receptor in the adrenal gland and reproductive axis. Adrenal hypoplasia congenita is characterized by absent development of the adult zone of the adrenal cortex, leading to neonatal adrenal insufficiency. Puberty usually does not occur or is arrested, reflecting variable degrees of gonadotropin deficiency. Although sexual differentiation is normal, some patients have testicular dysgenesis and impaired spermatogenesis despite gonadotropin replacement. Less commonly, adrenal hypoplasia congenita, sex reversal, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism can be caused by mutations of steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1). GnRH receptor mutations, the most common identifiable cause of normosmic IHH, account for 40% of autosomal recessive and 10% of sporadic cases of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. These patients have decreased LH response to exogenous GnRH. Some receptor mutations alter GnRH binding affinity, allowing apparently normal responses to pharmacologic doses of exogenous GnRH, whereas other mutations may alter signal transduction downstream of hormone binding. Mutations of the GnRH1 gene also have been reported in patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, although they are rare. G protein每coupled receptor GPR54 and its cognate receptor, kisspeptin, are important regulators of sexual maturation. Recessive mutations in GPR54 cause gonadotropin deficiency without anosmia. Patients retain responsiveness to exogenous GnRH, suggesting an abnormality in the neural pathways that control GnRH release. The genes encoding neurokinin B (TAC3), which is involved in preferential activation of GnRH release in early development, and its receptor (TAC3R) have been implicated in some families with normosmic IHH. Mutations in more than one gene (digenicity) may contribute to clinical heterogeneity in IHH patients. Rarely, recessive mutations in the LHb or FSHb gene have been described in patients with selective deficiencies of these gonadotropins. In approximately 10% of men with IHH, reversal of gonadotropin deficiency may occur in adult life. Also, a small fraction of men with IHH may present with androgen deficiency and infertility in adult life after having gone through apparently normal pubertal development.

A number of homeodomain transcription factors are involved in the development and differentiation of the specialized hormone-producing cells within the pituitary gland (Table 346-2). Patients with mutations of PROP1 have combined pituitary hormone deficiency that includes GH, prolactin (PRL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), LH, and FSH but not ACTH. LHX3 mutations cause combined pituitary hormone deficiency in association with cervical spine rigidity. HESX1 mutations cause septo-optic dysplasia and combined pituitary hormone deficiency.

Prader-Willi syndrome is characterized by obesity, hypotonic musculature, mental retardation, hypogonadism, short stature, and small hands and feet. Prader-Willi syndrome is a genomic imprinting disorder caused by deletions of the proximal portion of paternally derived chromosome 15q, uniparental disomy of the maternal alleles, or mutations of the genes/loci involved in imprinting (Chap. 62). Laurence-Moon syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by obesity, hypogonadism, mental retardation, polydactyly, and retinitis pigmentosa. Recessive mutations of leptin, or its receptor, cause severe obesity and pubertal arrest, apparently because of hypothalamic GnRH deficiency (Chap. 77).

Acquired Hypogonadotropic Disorders

Severe Illness, Stress, Malnutrition, and Exercise

These factors may cause reversible gonadotropin deficiency. Although gonadotropin deficiency and reproductive dysfunction are well documented in these conditions in women, men exhibit similar but less pronounced responses. Unlike women, most male runners and other endurance athletes have normal gonadotropin and sex steroid levels despite low body fat and frequent intensive exercise. Testosterone levels fall at the onset of illness and recover during recuperation. The magnitude of gonadotropin suppression generally correlates with the severity of illness. Although hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is the most common cause of androgen deficiency in patients with acute illness, some have elevated levels of LH and FSH, which suggest primary gonadal dysfunction. The pathophysiology of reproductive dysfunction during acute illness is unknown but probably involves a combination of cytokine and/or glucocorticoid effects. There is a high frequency of low testosterone levels in patients with chronic illnesses such as HIV infection, end-stage renal disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, and many types of cancer and in patients receiving glucocorticoids. About 20% of HIV-infected men with low testosterone levels have elevated LH and FSH levels; these patients presumably have primary testicular dysfunction. The remaining 80% have either normal or low LH and FSH levels; these men have a central hypothalamic-pituitary defect or a dual defect involving both the testis and the hypothalamic-pituitary centers. Muscle wasting is common in chronic diseases associated with hypogonadism, which also leads to debility, poor quality of life, and adverse outcome of disease. There is great interest in exploring strategies that can reverse androgen deficiency or attenuate the sarcopenia associated with chronic illness.

Men using opioids for relief of cancer or noncancerous pain or because of addiction often have suppressed testosterone and LH levels; the degree of suppression is dose-related and particularly severe with long-acting opioids such as methadone. Opioids suppress GnRH secretion and alter the sensitivity to feedback inhibition by gonadal steroids. Men who are heavy users of marijuana have decreased testosterone secretion and sperm production. The mechanism of marijuana-induced hypogonadism is decreased GnRH secretion. Gynecomastia observed in marijuana users can also be caused by plant estrogens in crude preparations. Androgen deprivation therapy in men with prostate cancer has been associated with increased risk of bone fractures, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular events, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, and poor quality of life.

Obesity

In men with mild to moderate obesity, SHBG levels decrease in proportion to the degree of obesity, resulting in lower total testosterone levels. However, free testosterone levels usually remain within the normal range. The decrease in SHBG levels is caused by increased circulating insulin, which inhibits SHBG production. Estradiol levels are higher in obese men than in healthy, nonobese controls because of aromatization of testosterone to estradiol in adipose tissue. Weight loss is associated with reversal of these abnormalities, including an increase in total and free testosterone levels and a decrease in estradiol levels. A subset of massively obese men may have a defect in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis as suggested by low free testosterone in the absence of elevated gonadotropins. Weight gain in adult men can accelerate the rate of age-related decline in testosterone levels.

Hyperprolactinemia

(See also Chap. 339.) Elevated PRL levels are associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. PRL inhibits hypothalamic GnRH secretion either directly or through modulation of tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic pathways. A PRL-secreting tumor also may destroy the surrounding gonadotropes by invasion or compression of the pituitary stalk. Treatment with dopamine agonists reverses gonadotropin deficiency, although there may be a delay relative to PRL suppression.

Sellar Mass Lesions

Neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions in the hypothalamus or pituitary can affect gonadotrope function directly or indirectly. In adults, pituitary adenomas constitute the largest category of space-occupying lesions affecting gonadotropin and other pituitary hormone production. Pituitary adenomas that extend into the suprasellar region can impair GnRH secretion and mildly increase PRL secretion (usually <50 g/L) because of impaired tonic inhibition by dopaminergic pathways. These tumors should be distinguished from prolactinomas, which typically secrete higher PRL levels. The presence of diabetes insipidus suggests the possibility of a craniopharyngioma, infiltrative disorder, or other hypothalamic lesions (Chap. 340).

Hemochromatosis

(See also Chap. 357.) Both the pituitary and the testis can be affected by excessive iron deposition. However, the pituitary defect is the predominant lesion in most patients with hemochromatosis and hypogonadism. The diagnosis of hemochromatosis is suggested by the association of characteristic skin discoloration, hepatic enlargement or dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, arthritis, cardiac conduction defects, and hypogonadism.

Primary Testicular Causes of Hypogonadism

Common causes of primary testicular dysfunction include Klinefelter's syndrome, uncorrected cryptorchidism, cancer chemotherapy, radiation to the testes, trauma, torsion, infectious orchitis, HIV infection, anorchia syndrome, and myotonic dystrophy. Primary testicular disorders may be associated with impaired spermatogenesis, decreased androgen production, or both. See Chap. 349 for disorders of testis development, androgen synthesis, and androgen action.

Klinefelter's Syndrome

(See also Chap. 349.) Klinefelter's syndrome is the most common chromosomal disorder associated with testicular dysfunction and male infertility. It occurs in about 1 in 1000 live-born males. Azoospermia is the rule in men with Klinefelter's syndrome who have the 47,XXY karyotype; however, men with mosaicism may have germ cells, especially at a younger age. The clinical phenotype of Klinefelter's syndrome can be heterogeneous, possibly because of mosaicism, polymorphisms in androgen receptor gene, variable testosterone levels, or other genetic factors. Testicular histology shows hyalinization of seminiferous tubules and absence of spermatogenesis. Although their function is impaired, the number of Leydig cells appears to increase. Testosterone is decreased and estradiol is increased, leading to clinical features of undervirilization and gynecomastia. Men with Klinefelter's syndrome are at increased risk of systemic lupus erythematosus, breast cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and lung cancer and reduced risk of prostate cancer. Periodic mammography for breast cancer surveillance is recommended for men with Klinefelter's syndrome. Fertility has been achieved by intracytoplasmic injection of sperm retrieved surgically from testicular biopsies of men with Klinefelter's syndrome, including some men with nonmosaic forms of Klinefelter's syndrome.

Cryptorchidism

Cryptorchidism occurs when there is incomplete descent of the testis from the abdominal cavity into the scrotum. About 3% of full-term and 30% of premature male infants have at least one undescended testis at birth, but descent is usually complete by the first few weeks of life. The incidence of cryptorchidism is <1% by 9 months of age. Androgens regulate both the transabdominal and inguinoscrotal descent of the testes through degeneration of the craniosuspensory ligament and a shortening of the gubernacula, respectively. Mutations in INSL3 and its receptor, which regulate the transabdominal portion of testicular descent, have been found in some patients with cryptorchidism.

Cryptorchidism is associated with increased risk of malignancy and infertility. Unilateral cryptorchidism, even when corrected before puberty, is associated with decreased sperm count, possibly reflecting unrecognized damage to the fully descended testis or other genetic factors. Epidemiologic, clinical, and molecular evidence supports the idea that cryptorchidism, hypospadias, impaired spermatogenesis, and testicular cancer may be causally related to common genetic and environment perturbations and are components of the testicular dysgenesis syndrome.

Acquired Testicular Defects

Viral orchitis may be caused by the mumps virus, echovirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and group B arboviruses. Orchitis occurs in as many as one-fourth of adult men with mumps; the orchitis is unilateral in about two-thirds and bilateral in the remainder. Orchitis usually develops a few days after the onset of parotitis but may precede it. The testis may return to normal size and function or undergo atrophy. Semen analysis returns to normal for three-fourths of men with unilateral involvement but for only one-third of men with bilateral orchitis. Trauma, including testicular torsion, also can cause secondary atrophy of the testes. The exposed position of the testes in the scrotum renders them susceptible to both thermal and physical trauma, particularly in men with hazardous occupations.

The testes are sensitive to radiation damage. Doses >200 mGy (20 rad) are associated with increased FSH and LH levels and damage to the spermatogonia. After 800 mGy (80 rad), oligospermia or azoospermia develops, and higher doses may obliterate the germinal epithelium. Permanent androgen deficiency in adult men is uncommon after therapeutic radiation; however, most boys given direct testicular radiation therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia have permanently low testosterone levels. Sperm banking should be considered before patients undergo radiation treatment or chemotherapy.

Drugs interfere with testicular function by several mechanisms, including inhibition of testosterone synthesis (e.g., ketoconazole), blockade of androgen action (e.g., spironolactone), increased estrogen (e.g., marijuana), or direct inhibition of spermatogenesis (e.g., chemotherapy).

Combination chemotherapy for acute leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, and testicular and other cancers may impair Leydig cell function and cause infertility. The degree of gonadal dysfunction depends on the type of chemotherapeutic agent and the dose and duration of therapy. Because of high response rates and the young age of these men, infertility and androgen deficiency have emerged as important long-term complications of cancer chemotherapy. Cyclophosphamide and combination regimens containing procarbazine are particularly toxic to germ cells. Thus, 90% of men with Hodgkin's lymphoma receiving MOPP (mechlorethamine, oncovin, procarbazine, prednisone) therapy develop azoospermia or extreme oligozoospermia; newer regimens that do not include procarbazine, such as ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine), are less toxic to germ cells.

Alcohol, when consumed in excess for prolonged periods, decreases testosterone, independent of liver disease or malnutrition. Elevated estradiol and decreased testosterone levels may occur in men taking digitalis.

The occupational and recreational history should be evaluated carefully in all men with infertility because of the toxic effects of many chemical agents on spermatogenesis. Known environmental hazards include microwaves and ultrasound and chemicals such as nematocide dibromochloropropane, cadmium, phthalates, and lead. In some populations, sperm density is said to have declined by as much as 40% in the last 50 years. Environmental estrogens or antiandrogens may be partly responsible.

Testicular failure also occurs as a part of polyglandular autoimmune insufficiency (Chap. 351). Sperm antibodies can cause isolated male infertility. In some instances, these antibodies are secondary phenomena resulting from duct obstruction or vasectomy. Granulomatous diseases can affect the testes, and testicular atrophy occurs in 10每20% of men with lepromatous leprosy because of direct tissue invasion by the mycobacteria. The tubules are involved initially, followed by endarteritis and destruction of Leydig cells.

Systemic disease can cause primary testis dysfunction in addition to suppressing gonadotropin production. In cirrhosis, a combined testicular and pituitary abnormality leads to decreased testosterone production independent of the direct toxic effects of ethanol. Impaired hepatic extraction of adrenal androstenedione leads to extraglandular conversion to estrone and estradiol, which partially suppresses LH. Testicular atrophy and gynecomastia are present in approximately one-half of men with cirrhosis. In chronic renal failure, androgen synthesis and sperm production decrease despite elevated gonadotropins. The elevated LH level is due to reduced clearance, but it does not restore normal testosterone production. About one-fourth of men with renal failure have hyperprolactinemia. Improvement in testosterone production with hemodialysis is incomplete, but successful renal transplantation may return testicular function to normal. Testicular atrophy is present in one-third of men with sickle cell anemia. The defect may be at either the testicular or the hypothalamic-pituitary level. Sperm density can decrease temporarily after acute febrile illness in the absence of a change in testosterone production. Infertility in men with celiac disease is associated with a hormonal pattern typical of androgen resistance, namely, elevated testosterone and LH levels.

Neurologic diseases associated with altered testicular function include myotonic dystrophy, spinobulbar muscular atrophy, and paraplegia. In myotonic dystrophy, small testes may be associated with impairment of both spermatogenesis and Leydig cell function. Spinobulbar muscular atrophy is caused by an expansion of the glutamine repeat sequences in the amino-terminal region of the AR; this expansion impairs function of the AR, but it is unclear how the alteration is related to the neurologic manifestations. Men with spinobulbar muscular atrophy often have undervirilization and infertility as a late manifestation. Spinal cord lesions that cause paraplegia can lead to a temporary decrease in testosterone levels and may cause persistent defects in spermatogenesis; some patients retain the capacity for penile erection and ejaculation.

Androgen Insensitivity Syndromes

Mutations in the AR cause resistance to the action of testosterone and DHT. These X-linked mutations are associated with variable degrees of defective male phenotypic development and undervirilization (Chap. 349). Although not technically hormone-insensitivity syndromes, two genetic disorders impair testosterone conversion to active sex steroids. Mutations in the SRD5A2 gene, which encodes 5-reductase type 2, prevent the conversion of testosterone to DHT, which is necessary for the normal development of the male external genitalia. Mutations in the CYP19 gene, which encodes aromatase, prevent testosterone conversion to estradiol. Males with CYP19 mutations have delayed epiphyseal fusion, tall stature, eunuchoid proportions, and osteoporosis, consistent with evidence from an estrogen receptor每deficient individual that these testosterone actions are mediated indirectly via estrogen.
 
Gynecomastia

Gynecomastia refers to enlargement of the male breast. It is caused by excess estrogen action and is usually the result of an increased estrogen/androgen ratio. True gynecomastia is associated with glandular breast tissue that is >4 cm in diameter and often tender. Glandular tissue enlargement should be distinguished from excess adipose tissue: glandular tissue is firmer and contains fibrous-like cords. Gynecomastia occurs as a normal physiologic phenomenon in the newborn (due to transplacental transfer of maternal and placental estrogens), during puberty (high ratio of estrogen to androgen in early stages of puberty), and with aging (increased fat tissue and increased aromatase activity), but it also can result from pathologic conditions associated with androgen deficiency or estrogen excess. The prevalence of gynecomastia increases with age and body mass index (BMI), probably because of increased aromatase activity in adipose tissue. Medications that alter androgen metabolism or action may also cause gynecomastia. The relative risk of breast cancer is increased in men with gynecomastia, although the absolute risk is relatively small.

Pathologic Gynecomastia

Any cause of androgen deficiency can lead to gynecomastia, reflecting an increased estrogen/androgen ratio, as estrogen synthesis still occurs by aromatization of residual adrenal and gonadal androgens. Gynecomastia is a characteristic feature of Klinefelter's syndrome (Chap. 349). Androgen insensitivity disorders also cause gynecomastia. Excess estrogen production may be caused by tumors, including Sertoli cell tumors in isolation or in association with Peutz-Jegher syndrome or Carney complex. Tumors that produce hCG, including some testicular tumors, stimulate Leydig cell estrogen synthesis. Increased conversion of androgens to estrogens can be a result of increased availability of substrate (androstenedione) for extraglandular estrogen formation (CAH, hyperthyroidism, and most feminizing adrenal tumors) or diminished catabolism of androstenedione (liver disease) so that androgen precursors are shunted to aromatase in peripheral sites. Obesity is associated with increased aromatization of androgen precursors to estrogens. Extraglandular aromatase activity can also be increased in tumors of the liver or adrenal gland or rarely as an inherited disorder. Several families with increased peripheral aromatase activity inherited as an autosomal dominant or an X-linked disorder have been described. In some families with this disorder, an inversion in chromosome 15q21.2-3 causes the CYP19 gene to be activated by the regulatory elements of contiguous genes, resulting in excessive estrogen production in the fat and other extragonadal tissues. Drugs can cause gynecomastia by acting directly as estrogenic substances (e.g., oral contraceptives, phytoestrogens, digitalis), inhibiting androgen synthesis (e.g., ketoconazole), or action (e.g., spironolactone).

Because up to two-thirds of pubertal boys and one-half of hospitalized men have palpable glandular tissue that is benign, detailed investigation or intervention is not indicated in all men presenting with gynecomastia (Fig. 346-5). In addition to the extent of gynecomastia, recent onset, rapid growth, tender tissue, and occurrence in a lean subject should prompt more extensive evaluation. This should include a careful drug history, measurement and examination of the testes, assessment of virilization, evaluation of liver function, and hormonal measurements, including testosterone, estradiol, and androstenedione, LH, and hCG. A karyotype should be obtained in men with very small testes to exclude Klinefelter's syndrome. In spite of extensive evaluation, the etiology is established in fewer than one-half of patients.

Treatment: Gynecomastia

When the primary cause can be identified and corrected, breast enlargement usually subsides over several months. However, if gynecomastia is of long duration, surgery is the most effective therapy. Indications for surgery include severe psychological and/or cosmetic problems, continued growth or tenderness, and suspected malignancy. In patients who have painful gynecomastia and in whom surgery cannot be performed, treatment with antiestrogens such as tamoxifen (20 mg/d) can reduce pain and breast tissue size in over one-half of the patients. The estrogen receptor antagonists tamoxifen and raloxifen have been reported in small trials to reduce breast size in men with pubertal gynecomastia, although complete regression of breast enlargement is unusual with the use of estrogen receptor antagonists. Aromatase inhibitors can be effective in the early proliferative phase of the disorder. However, in a randomized trial in men with established gynecomastia, anastrozole was no more effective than placebo in reducing breast size.
 
Aging-Related Changes in Male Reproductive Function

A number of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies (e.g., the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, the Massachusetts Male Aging Study, and the European Male Aging Study) have established that testosterone concentrations decrease with advancing age. This age-related decline starts in the third decade of life and progresses slowly; the rate of decline in testosterone concentrations is greater in obese men, men with chronic illness, and those taking medications than in healthy older men. Because SHBG concentrations are higher in older men than in younger men, free or bioavailable testosterone concentrations decline with aging to a greater extent than do total testosterone concentrations. The age-related decline in testosterone is due to defects at all levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis: pulsatile GnRH secretion is attenuated, LH response to GnRH is reduced, and testicular response to LH is impaired. However, the gradual rise of LH with aging suggests that testis dysfunction is the main cause of declining androgen levels. The term andropause has been used to denote age-related decline in testosterone concentrations; this term is a misnomer because there is no discrete time when testosterone concentrations decline abruptly.

In epidemiologic surveys, low total and bioavailable testosterone concentrations have been associated with decreased appendicular skeletal muscle mass and strength, decreased self-reported physical function, higher visceral fat mass, insulin resistance, and increased risk of coronary artery disease and mortality. An analysis of signs and symptoms in older men in the European Male Aging Study revealed a syndromic association of sexual and physical symptoms with testosterone levels <320 ng/dL in community-dwelling older men. In systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials, testosterone therapy in healthy older men with low or low-normal testosterone levels was associated with greater increments in lean body mass, grip strength, and self-reported physical function than was the case with placebo. Testosterone therapy also induced greater improvement in vertebral but not femoral bone mineral density. Testosterone therapy in older men with sexual dysfunction and unequivocally low testosterone levels improves libido, but testosterone effects on erectile function and response to selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors have been inconsistent. Testosterone therapy has not been shown to improve depression scores, fracture risk, cognitive function, or clinical outcomes in older men. Furthermore, neither the long-term risks nor the clinical benefits of testosterone therapy in older men have been demonstrated in adequately powered trials. Although there is no evidence that testosterone causes prostate cancer, there is concern that testosterone therapy might induce the growth of subclinical prostate cancers or exacerbate cardiovascular disease. One randomized testosterone trial in older men with mobility limitation and a high burden of chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia reported a greater number of cardiovascular events in men randomized to the testosterone arm of the study than in those randomized to the placebo arm. Population screening of all older men for low testosterone levels is not recommended, and testing should be restricted to men who have symptoms or physical features attributable to androgen deficiency. Testosterone therapy is not recommended for all older men with low testosterone levels. In older men with significant symptoms of androgen deficiency who have testosterone levels <200 ng/dL, testosterone therapy may be considered on an individualized basis and should be instituted after careful discussion of the risks and benefits (see "Testosterone Replacement," below).

Testicular morphology, semen production, and fertility are maintained up to a very old age in men. Although concern has been expressed about age-related increases in germ cell mutations and impairment of DNA repair mechanisms, the frequency of chromosomal aneuploidy or structural abnormalities does not increase in the sperm of older men. However, the incidence of autosomal dominant diseases such as achondroplasia, polyposis coli, Marfan's syndrome, and Apert's syndrome increases in the offspring of men who are advanced in age, consistent with transmission of sporadic missense mutations.

Approach to the Patient: Androgen Deficiency

Hypogonadism often is characterized by decreased sex drive, reduced frequency of sexual intercourse or inability to maintain erections, reduced beard growth, loss of muscle mass, decreased testicular size, and gynecomastia. Less than 10% of patients with erectile dysfunction alone have testosterone deficiency. Thus, it is useful to look for a constellation of symptoms and signs suggestive of androgen deficiency. Except when extreme, these clinical features may be difficult to distinguish from changes that occur with normal aging. Moreover, androgen deficiency may develop gradually. Although population studies such as the Massachusetts Male Aging Study and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging have reported a high prevalence of low testosterone levels in middle-aged and older men, the age-related decline in testosterone should be distinguished from classic hypogonadism due to diseases of the testes, the pituitary, or the hypothalamus.

When symptoms or clinical features suggest possible androgen deficiency, the laboratory evaluation is initiated by the measurement of total testosterone, preferably in the morning, using a reliable assay such as LC-MS/MS (Fig. 346-6). A consistently low total testosterone level <300 ng/dL measured by a reliable assay in association with symptoms provides evidence of testosterone deficiency. An early-morning testosterone level >350 ng/dL makes the diagnosis of androgen deficiency unlikely. In men with testosterone levels between 200 and 350 ng/dL, the total testosterone level should be repeated and a free testosterone level should be measured. In older men and in patients with other clinical states that are associated with alterations in SHBG levels, a direct measurement of free testosterone level by equilibrium dialysis can be useful in unmasking testosterone deficiency.

When androgen deficiency has been confirmed by low testosterone concentrations, LH should be measured to classify the patient as having primary (high LH) or secondary (low or inappropriately normal LH) hypogonadism. An elevated LH level indicates that the defect is at the testicular level. Common causes of primary testicular failure include Klinefelter's syndrome, HIV infection, uncorrected cryptorchidism, cancer chemotherapeutic agents, radiation, surgical orchiectomy, and prior infectious orchitis. Unless causes of primary testicular failure are known, a karyotype should be performed in men with low testosterone and elevated LH to exclude Klinefelter's syndrome. Men who have low testosterone but "inappropriately normal" or low LH levels have secondary hypogonadism; their defect resides at the hypothalamic-pituitary level. Common causes of acquired secondary hypogonadism include space-occupying lesions of the sella, hyperprolactinemia, chronic illness, hemochromatosis, excessive exercise, and substance abuse. Measurement of PRL and an MRI scan of the hypothalamic-pituitary region can help exclude the presence of a space-occupying lesion. Patients in whom known causes of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism have been excluded are classified as having IHH. It is not unusual for congenital causes of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism such as Kallmann's syndrome to be diagnosed in young adults.

Treatment: Age-Related Reproductive Dysfunction


Gonadotropins

Gonadotropin therapy is used to establish or restore fertility in patients with gonadotropin deficiency of any cause. Several gonadotropin preparations are available. Human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG; purified from the urine of postmenopausal women) contains 75 IU FSH and 75 IU LH per vial. hCG (purified from the urine of pregnant women) has little FSH activity and resembles LH in its ability to stimulate testosterone production by Leydig cells. Recombinant LH is now available. Because of the expense of hMG, treatment usually is begun with hCG alone, and hMG is added later to promote the FSH-dependent stages of spermatid development. Recombinant human FSH (hFSH) is now available and is indistinguishable from purified urinary hFSH in its biologic activity and pharmacokinetics in vitro and in vivo, although the mature  subunit of recombinant hFSH has seven fewer amino acids. Recombinant hFSH is available in ampules containing 75 IU (7.5 g FSH), which accounts for >99% of protein content. Once spermatogenesis is restored using combined FSH and LH therapy, hCG alone is often sufficient to maintain spermatogenesis.

Although a variety of treatment regimens are used, 1500每2000 IU of hCG or recombinant human LH (rhLH) administered intramuscularly three times weekly is a reasonable starting dose. Testosterone levels should be measured 6每8 weeks later and 48每72 hours after the hCG or rhLH injection; the hCG/rhLH dose should be adjusted to achieve testosterone levels in the mid-normal range. Sperm counts should be monitored on a monthly basis. It may take several months for spermatogenesis to be restored; therefore, it is important to forewarn patients about the potential length and expense of the treatment and to provide conservative estimates of success rates. If testosterone levels are in the mid-normal range but the sperm concentrations are low after 6 months of therapy with hCG alone, FSH should be added. This can be done by using hMG, highly purified urinary hFSH, or recombinant hFSH. The selection of the FSH dose is empirical. A common practice is to start with the addition of 75 IU FSH three times a week in conjunction with the hCG/rhLH injections. If sperm densities are still low after 3 months of combined treatment, the FSH dose should be increased to 150 IU. Occasionally, it may take 18每24 months for spermatogenesis to be restored.

The two best predictors of success using gonadotropin therapy in hypogonadotropic men are testicular volume at presentation and time of onset. In general, men with testicular volumes >8 mL have better response rates than those who have testicular volumes <4 mL. Patients who became hypogonadotropic after puberty experience higher success rates than those who have never undergone pubertal changes. Spermatogenesis usually can be reinitiated by hCG alone, with high rates of success for men with postpubertal onset of hypogonadotropism. The presence of a primary testicular abnormality such as cryptorchidism will attenuate testicular response to gonadotropin therapy. Prior androgen therapy does not preclude subsequent response to gonadotropin therapy, although some studies suggest that it may attenuate response to subsequent gonadotropin therapy.

Testosterone Replacement

Androgen therapy is indicated to restore testosterone levels to normal to correct features of androgen deficiency. Testosterone replacement improves libido and overall sexual activity and increases energy, lean muscle mass, and bone density. The benefits of testosterone replacement therapy have been proved only in men who have documented androgen deficiency, as demonstrated by testosterone levels that are well below the lower limit of normal (<250 ng/dL).

Testosterone is available in a variety of formulations with distinct pharmacokinetics (Table 346-3). Testosterone serves as a prohormone and is converted to 17-estradiol by aromatase and to 5-dihydrotestosterone by 5-reductase. Therefore, in evaluating testosterone formulations, it is important to consider whether the formulation being used can achieve physiologic estradiol and DHT concentrations in addition to normal testosterone concentrations. Although testosterone concentrations at the lower end of the normal male range can restore sexual function, it is not clear whether low-normal testosterone levels can maintain bone mineral density and muscle mass. The current recommendation is to restore testosterone levels to the mid-normal range.

Oral Derivatives of Testosterone

Testosterone is well-absorbed after oral administration but is quickly degraded during the first pass through the liver. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve sustained blood levels of testosterone after oral administration of crystalline testosterone. 17-Alkylated derivatives of testosterone (e.g., 17-methyl testosterone, oxandrolone, fluoxymesterone) are relatively resistant to hepatic degradation and can be administered orally; however, because of the potential for hepatotoxicity, including cholestatic jaundice, peliosis, and hepatoma, these formulations should not be used for testosterone replacement. Hereditary angioedema due to C1 esterase deficiency is the only exception to this general recommendation; in this condition, oral 17-alkylated androgens are useful because they stimulate hepatic synthesis of the C1 esterase inhibitor.

Injectable Forms of Testosterone

The esterification of testosterone at the 17-hydroxy position makes the molecule hydrophobic and extends its duration of action. The slow release of testosterone ester from an oily depot in the muscle accounts for its extended duration of action. The longer the side chain, the greater the hydrophobicity of the ester, and the longer the duration of action. Thus, testosterone enanthate, cypionate, and undecanoate with longer side chains have longer durations of action than does testosterone propionate. Within 24 hours after intramuscular administration of 200 mg testosterone enanthate or cypionate, testosterone levels rise into the high-normal or supraphysiologic range and then gradually decline into the hypogonadal range over the next 2 weeks. A bimonthly regimen of testosterone enanthate or cypionate therefore results in peaks and troughs in testosterone levels that are accompanied by changes in a patient's mood, sexual desire, and energy level. The kinetics of testosterone enanthate and cypionate are similar. Estradiol and DHT levels are normal if testosterone replacement is physiologic.

Transdermal Testosterone Patch

Nongenital testosterone patches, when applied in an appropriate dose, can normalize testosterone, DHT, and estradiol levels 4每12 hours after application. Sexual function and well-being are restored in androgen-deficient men treated with the nongenital patch. One 5-mg patch may not be sufficient to increase testosterone into the mid-normal male range in all hypogonadal men; some patients may need two 5-mg patches daily to achieve the targeted testosterone concentrations. The use of testosterone patches may be associated with skin irritation in some individuals.

Testosterone Gel

Two testosterone gels, Androgel and Testim, when applied topically to the skin in 5-, 7.5-, and 10-g doses, can maintain total and free testosterone concentrations in the mid- to high-normal range in hypogonadal men. The current recommendations are to begin with a 50-mg dose and adjust the dose on the basis of testosterone levels. The advantages of the testosterone gel include ease of application and flexibility of dosing. A major concern is the potential for inadvertent transfer of the gel to a sexual partner or to children who may come in close contact with the patient. The ratio of DHT to testosterone concentrations is higher in men treated with the testosterone gel than in healthy men. Also, there is considerable intra- and interindividual variation in serum testosterone levels in men treated with the transdermal gel.

Buccal Adhesive Testosterone

A buccal testosterone tablet that adheres to the buccal mucosa and releases testosterone as it is slowly dissolved has been approved. After twice-daily application of 30-mg tablets, serum testosterone levels are maintained within the normal male range in a majority of treated hypogonadal men. The adverse effects include buccal ulceration and gum problems in a few subjects. The effects of food and brushing on absorption have not been studied in detail.

Implants of crystalline testosterone can be inserted in the subcutaneous tissue by means of a trocar through a small skin incision. Testosterone is released by surface erosion of the implant and absorbed into the systemic circulation. Two to six 200-mg implants can maintain testosterone in the mid- to high-normal range for up to 6 months. Potential drawbacks include incising the skin for insertion and removal and spontaneous extrusions and fibrosis at the site of the implant.

Testosterone Formulations Not Available in the United States

Testosterone undecanoate, when administered orally in oleic acid, is absorbed preferentially through the lymphatics into the systemic circulation and is spared first-pass degradation in the liver. Doses of 40每80 mg orally, two or three times daily, are typically used. However, the clinical responses are variable and suboptimal. Ratios of DHT to testosterone are higher in hypogonadal men treated with oral testosterone undecanoate compared with eugonadal men.

After initial priming, long-acting testosterone undecanoate in oil, when administered intramuscularly every 12 weeks, maintains serum testosterone, estradiol, and DHT in the normal male range and corrects symptoms of androgen deficiency in a majority of treated men. However, the large injection volume (4 mL) is a relative drawback.

Novel Androgen Formulations

A number of androgen formulations with better pharmacokinetics or more selective activity profiles are under development. Two long-acting esters, testosterone buciclate and testosterone undecanoate, when injected intramuscularly, can maintain circulating testosterone concentrations in the male range for 7每12 weeks. Initial clinical trials have demonstrated the feasibility of administering testosterone by the sublingual or buccal route. 7-Methyl-19-nortestosterone is an androgen that cannot be 5-reduced; therefore, compared to testosterone, it has relatively greater agonist activity in muscle and gonadotropin suppression but lesser activity on the prostate.

Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are a class of androgen receptor ligands that bind the androgen receptor and display tissue-selective actions. A number of nonsteroidal SARMs that act as full agonists on the muscle and bone and spare the prostate to varying degrees have advanced to phase I and II human trials. Nonsteroidal SARMs do not serve as substrates for either the steroid 5-reductase or the CYP19 aromatase. SARM binding to AR induces specific conformational changes in the AR protein, which then modulates protein-protein interactions between AR and its coregulators, resulting in tissue-specific regulation of gene expression.

Pharmacologic Uses of Androgens

Androgens and SARMs are being evaluated as anabolic therapies for functional limitations associated with aging and chronic illness. Testosterone supplementation increases skeletal muscle mass, maximal voluntary strength, and muscle power in healthy men, hypogonadal men, older men with low testosterone levels, HIV-infected men with weight loss, and men receiving glucocorticoids. These anabolic effects of testosterone are related to testosterone dose and circulating concentrations. Systematic reviews have confirmed that testosterone therapy in HIV-infected men with weight loss promotes improvements in body weight, lean body mass, muscle strength, and depression indices, leading to the recommendation that testosterone be considered as an adjunctive therapy in HIV-infected men who are experiencing unexplained weight loss and have low testosterone levels. Similarly, in glucocorticoid-treated men, testosterone therapy should be considered to maintain muscle mass and strength and vertebral bone mineral density. It is not known whether testosterone therapy in older men with functional limitations is safe and effective in improving physical function and health-related quality of life and reducing disability. Concerns about potential adverse effects of testosterone on prostate and cardiovascular event rates have encouraged the development of selective androgen receptor modulators that are preferentially anabolic and spare the prostate.

Testosterone administration induces hypertrophy of both types 1 and 2 fibers and increases satellite cell (muscle progenitor cells) and myonuclear numbers. Androgens promote the differentiation of mesenchymal, multipotent progenitor cells into the myogenic lineage and inhibit their differentiation into the adipogenic lineage. Testosterone may have additional effects on satellite cell replication and muscle protein synthesis that may contribute to an increase in skeletal muscle mass.

Other indications for androgen therapy are in selected patients with anemia due to bone marrow failure (an indication largely supplanted by erythropoietin) and for hereditary angioedema.

Male Hormonal Contraception Based on Combined Administration of Testosterone and Gonadotropin Inhibitors

Supraphysiologic doses of testosterone (200 mg testosterone enanthate weekly) suppress LH and FSH secretion and induce azoospermia in 50% of white men and >95% of Asian men. The World Health Organization (WHO)-supported multicenter efficacy trials have demonstrated that suppression of spermatogenesis to azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia (<3 million/mL) by administration of testosterone enanthate to men results in effective contraception. Because of concern about long-term adverse effects of supraphysiologic testosterone doses, regimens that combine other gonadotropin inhibitors such as GnRH antagonists and progestins, with replacement doses of testosterone are being investigated. Oral etonogestrel daily in combination with intramuscular testosterone decanoate every 4每6 weeks induced azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia (sperm density <1 million/mL) in 99% of treated men over a 1-year period. This regimen was associated with weight gain, deceased testicular volume, and decreased plasma high- density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and its long-term safety has not been demonstrated. Selective androgen receptor modulators that are more potent inhibitors of gonadotropins than testosterone and spare the prostate hold promise for their contraceptive potential.

Recommended Regimens for Androgen Replacement

Testosterone esters are administered typically at doses of 75每100 mg intramuscularly every week or 150每200 mg every 2 weeks. One or two 5-mg nongenital testosterone patches can be applied daily over the skin of the back, thigh, or upper arm away from pressure areas. Testosterone gel typically is applied over a covered area of skin at a dose of 5每10 g daily; patients should wash their hands after gel application. Bioadhesive buccal testosterone tablets at a dose of 30 mg typically are applied twice daily on the buccal mucosa.

Establishing Efficacy of Testosterone Replacement Therapy

Because a clinically useful marker of androgen action is not available, restoration of testosterone levels into the mid-normal range remains the goal of therapy. Measurements of LH and FSH are not useful in assessing the adequacy of testosterone replacement. Testosterone should be measured 3 months after initiating therapy to assess adequacy of therapy. There is substantial interindividual variability in serum testosterone levels, presumably due to genetic differences in testosterone clearance. In patients who are treated with testosterone enanthate or cypionate, testosterone levels should be 350每600 ng/dL 1 week after the injection. If testosterone levels are outside this range, adjustments should be made either in the dose or in the interval between injections. In men on transdermal patch or gel or buccal testosterone therapy, testosterone levels should be in the mid-normal range (500每700 ng/dL) 4每12 hours after application. If testosterone levels are outside this range, the dose should be adjusted.

Restoration of sexual function, secondary sex characteristics, energy, and well-being and maintenance of muscle and bone health are important objectives of testosterone replacement therapy. The patient should be asked about sexual desire and activity, the presence of early-morning erections, and the ability to achieve and maintain erections adequate for sexual intercourse. Some hypogonadal men continue to complain about sexual dysfunction even after testosterone replacement has been instituted; these patients may benefit from counseling. The hair growth in response to androgen replacement is variable and depends on ethnicity. Hypogonadal men with prepubertal onset of androgen deficiency who begin testosterone therapy in their late twenties or thirties may find it difficult to adjust to their newly found sexuality and may benefit from counseling. If the patient has a sexual partner, the partner should be included in counseling because of the dramatic physical and sexual changes that occur with androgen treatment.

Contraindications for Androgen Administration

Testosterone administration is contraindicated in men with a history of prostate or breast cancer (Table 346-4). Testosterone therapy should not be administered without further urologic evaluation to men with a palpable prostate nodule or induration or prostate-specific antigen >4 ng/mL or >3 ng/mL in men at high risk for prostate cancer such as blacks or men with first-degree relatives with prostate cancer or with severe lower urinary tract symptoms (American Urological Association lower urinary tract symptom score >19). Testosterone replacement should not be administered to men with baseline hematocrit 50%, severe untreated obstructive sleep apnea, uncontrolled or poorly controlled congestive heart failure, or recent myocardial infarction or unstable angina.

Monitoring Potential Adverse Experiences

The clinical effectiveness and safety of testosterone replacement therapy should be assessed 3每6 months after initiating testosterone therapy and annually thereafter (Table 346-5). Potential adverse effects include acne, oiliness of skin, erythrocytosis, breast tenderness and enlargement, leg edema, induction and exacerbation of obstructive sleep apnea, and increased risk of detection of prostate disease. In addition, there may be formulation-specific adverse effects such as skin irritation with transdermal patches, risk of gel transfer to a sexual partner with testosterone gels, buccal ulceration and gum problems with buccal testosterone, and pain and mood fluctuation with injectable testosterone esters.

Table 346-5 Monitoring Men Receiving Testosterone Therapy

 
 
1. Evaluate patient 3每6 months after treatment initiation and then annually to assess whether symptoms have responded to treatment and whether patient is experiencing any adverse effects. 
2. Monitor testosterone level 3每6 months after initiation of testosterone therapy:

     Therapy should aim to raise serum testosterone level into mid-normal range.

         Injectable testosterone enanthate or cypionate: Measure serum testosterone level midway between injections. If testosterone is >700 ng/dL (24.5 nmol/L) or <400 ng/dL (14.1 nmol/L), adjust dose or frequency.

         Transdermal patches: Assess testosterone level 3每12 h after application of the patch; adjust dose to achieve testosterone level in mid-normal range.

         Buccal testosterone bioadhesive tablet: Assess level immediately before or after application of fresh system.

         Transdermal gels: Assess testosterone level any time after patient has been on treatment for at least 1 week; adjust dose to achieve serum testosterone level in the mid-normal range.

         Testosterone pellets: Measure testosterone levels at the end of dosing interval. Adjust number of pellets and/or dosing interval to achieve serum testosterone levels in normal range.

         Oral testosterone undecanoate*: Monitor serum testosterone level 3 to 5 h after ingestion.

         Injectable testosterone undecanoate: Measure serum testosterone level just before each subsequent injection and adjust dosing interval to maintain serum testosterone in mid-normal range.
 
3. Check hematocrit at baseline at 3每6 months and then annually. If hematocrit is >54%, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to a safe level; evaluate patient for hypoxia and sleep apnea; reinitiate therapy with a reduced dose. 
4. Measure bone mineral density of lumbar spine and/or femoral neck after 1每2 years of testosterone therapy in hypogonadal men with osteoporosis or low trauma fracture, consistent with regional standard of care. 
5. In men 40 years of age or older with baseline PSA >0.6 ng/mL, perform digital rectal examination and check PSA level before initiating treatment at 3每6 months and then in accordance with guidelines for prostate cancer screening depending on age and race of patient. 
6. Obtain urologic consultation if there is:

     An increase in serum PSA concentration >1.4 ng/mL within any 12-month period of testosterone treatment.

     A PSA velocity >0.4 ng/mL per year using PSA level after 6 months of testosterone administration as reference (applicable only if PSA data are available for a period exceeding 2 years).

     Detection of a prostatic abnormality on digital rectal examination.

     An AUA/IPSS prostate symptom score >19.
 
7. Evaluate formulation-specific adverse effects at each visit:

     Buccal testosterone tablets: Inquire about alterations in taste and examine gums and oral mucosa for irritation.

     Injectable testosterone esters (enanthate, cypionate, and undecanoate): Ask about fluctuations in mood or libido and, rarely, cough after injections.

     Testosterone patches: Look for skin reaction at application site.

     Testosterone gels: Advise patients to cover application sites with a shirt and wash skin with soap and water before having skin-to-skin contact because testosterone gels leave a testosterone residue on skin that can be transferred to a woman or child who comes in close contact. Serum testosterone levels are maintained when application site is washed 4每6 h after application of testosterone gel.

     Testosterone pellets: Look for signs of infection, fibrosis, or pellet extrusion.

Hemoglobin Levels

Administration of testosterone to androgen-deficient men typically is associated with a 3每5% increase in hemoglobin levels due to suppression of hepcidin and increased iron availability for erythropoiesis. The magnitude of hemoglobin increase during testosterone therapy is greater in older men than younger men and in men who have sleep apnea, a significant smoking history, or chronic obstructive lung disease. The frequency of erythrocytosis is higher in hypogonadal men treated with injectable testosterone esters than in those treated with transdermal formulations, presumably due to the higher testosterone dose delivered by the typical regimens of testosterone esters. Erythrocytosis is the most common adverse event reported in testosterone trials in middle-aged and older men and also the most common cause of treatment discontinuation in these trials. If hematocrit rises above 54%, testosterone therapy should be stopped until hematocrit has fallen to <50%. After evaluation of the patient for hypoxia and sleep apnea, testosterone therapy may be reinitiated at a lower dose.

Prostate and Serum PSA Levels

Testosterone replacement therapy increases prostate volume to the size seen in age-matched controls but does not increase prostate volume beyond that expected for age. There is no evidence that testosterone therapy causes prostate cancer. However, androgen administration can exacerbate preexisting metastatic prostate cancer. Many older men harbor microscopic foci of cancer in their prostates. It is not known whether long-term testosterone administration will induce these microscopic foci to grow into clinically significant cancers.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels are lower in testosterone-deficient men and are restored to normal after testosterone replacement. There is considerable test-retest variability in PSA measurements. Increments in PSA levels after testosterone supplementation in androgen-deficient men are generally <0.5 ng/mL, and increments >1 ng/mL over a 3每6-month period are unusual. The 90% confidence interval for the change in PSA values in men with benign prostatic hypertrophy measured 3每6 months apart is 1.4 ng/mL. Therefore, the Endocrine Society expert panel suggests that an increase in PSA >1.4 ng/mL in any one year after starting testosterone therapy, if confirmed, should lead to urologic evaluation. PSA velocity criterion can be used for patients who have sequential PSA measurements for >2 years; a change of >0.40 ng/mL per year merits closer urologic follow-up.

Cardiovascular Risk

In epidemiologic studies, testosterone concentrations are negatively related to the risk of diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. A recent testosterone trial in older men with mobility limitation was stopped early because of the higher rates of cardiovascular events in the testosterone arm than in the placebo arm of the trial. Meta-analyses of testosterone trials have found no statistically significant increase in cardiovascular event rates in men receiving testosterone therapy, although nonsignificant increases have been noted. Inferences about adverse events from previous trials included in these meta-analyses were limited by poor ascertainment, small numbers of events, and small numbers of participants. Adequately powered prospective studies are needed to determine the effect of testosterone replacement on cardiovascular risk.

Androgen Abuse by Athletes and Recreational Bodybuilders

The illicit use of androgenic-anabolic steroids (AAS) to enhance athletic performance first surfaced in the 1950s among power lifters and spread rapidly to other sports, professional as well as high school athletes, and recreational bodybuilders. In the early 1980s, the use of AAS spread beyond the athletic community into the general population, and now as many as 2 million Americans, most of them men, probably have used these compounds. The most commonly used androgenic steroids include testosterone esters, nandrolone, stanozolol, methandienone, and methenolol. Athletes generally use increasing doses of multiple steroids in a practice known as stacking.

The adverse effects of long-term AAS abuse are poorly understood. Most of the information about the adverse effects of AAS has emerged from case reports, uncontrolled studies, or clinical trials that used replacement doses of testosterone. The adverse event data from clinical trials using physiologic replacement doses of testosterone have been extrapolated unjustifiably to AAS users who may administer 10每100 times the replacement doses of testosterone over many years and to support the claim that AAS use is safe. A substantial fraction of androgenic steroid users also use other drugs that are perceived to be muscle-building or performance-enhancing such as growth hormone; IGF-I; insulin; stimulants such as amphetamine, clenbuterol, cocaine, ephedrine, and thyroxine; and drugs perceived to reduce adverse effects such as hCG, aromatase inhibitors, and estrogen antagonists. The men who abuse androgenic steroids are more likely to engage in other high-risk behaviors than are nonusers. The adverse events associated with AAS use may be due to AAS themselves, concomitant use of other drugs, high-risk behaviors, and host characteristics that may render these individuals more susceptible to AAS use or other high-risk behaviors.

The high rates of mortality and morbidity observed in AAS users are alarming. One Finnish study reported 4.6 times the risk of death among elite power lifters than among age-matched men from the general population. The causes of death among power lifters included suicides, myocardial infarction, hepatic coma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. A retrospective review of patient records in Sweden also reported higher standardized mortality ratios for AAS users than for nonusers.

Numerous reports of cardiac death among young AAS users raise concerns about the adverse cardiovascular effects of AAS. High doses of AAS may induce proatherogenic dyslipidemia, increase thrombosis risk via effects on clotting factors and platelets, and induce vasospasm through their effects on vascular nitric oxide. The finding of androgen receptors on myocardial cells suggests that AAS may be directly toxic to myocardial cells.

Replacement doses of testosterone, when administered parenterally, are associated with only a small decrease in HDL cholesterol and little or no effect on total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. In contrast, supraphysiologic doses of testosterone and orally administered, 17-alylated, nonaromatizable AAS are associated with marked reductions in HDL cholesterol and increases in LDL cholesterol.

Long-term AAS use suppresses LH and FSH secretion and inhibits endogenous testosterone production and spermatogenesis. Men who have used AAS for more than a few months experience suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary- testicular (HPT) axis after stopping AAS that may be associated with sexual dysfunction, infertility, and depression; in some AAS users, gonadotropin suppression may last more than a year. The dysphoria caused by androgen withdrawal may cause some men to revert to using AAS, leading to continued use and AAS dependence. As many as 30% of AAS users develop a syndrome of AAS dependence that is characterized by long-term AAS use despite adverse medical and psychiatric effects.

Unsafe injection practices, high-risk behaviors, and increased rates of incarceration put AAS users at increased risk of HIV and hepatitis B and C. In one survey, nearly 1 in 10 gay men had injected AAS or other substances, and AAS users were more likely to report high-risk unprotected anal sex than were other men.

Some AAS users develop manic symptoms during AAS exposure (sometimes associated with violence) and major depression (sometimes associated with suicidality) during AAS withdrawal. Users also may engage in other forms of illicit drug use, which may be potentiated or exacerbated by AAS.

Elevated liver enzymes, cholestatic jaundice, hepatic neoplasms, and peliosis hepatis have been reported with oral 17-alkylated AAS. AAS use may cause muscle hypertrophy without compensatory adaptations in tendons, ligaments, and joints, thus increasing the risk of tendon and joint injuries. AAS use is associated with acne and baldness, as well as increased body hair.

Accredited laboratories use gas chromatography每mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography每mass spectrometry to detect anabolic steroid abuse. In recent years, the availability of high-resolution mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry has improved the sensitivity of detecting androgen abuse. Illicit testosterone use generally is detected by the application of the measurement of the ratio of urinary testosterone to epitestosterone and further confirmed by the use of the 13C:12C ratio in testosterone by the use of isotope ratio combustion mass spectrometry. Exogenous testosterone administration increases urinary testosterone glucuronide excretion and consequently the ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone. Ratios above 4 suggest exogenous testosterone use but can also reflect genetic variation. Synthetic testosterone has a lower 13C:12C ratio than endogenously produced testosterone, and these differences in the 13C:12C ratio can be detected by isotope ratio combustion mass spectrometry, which is used to confirm exogenous testosterone use in individuals with a high ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone.

The Female Reproductive System, Infertility, and Contraception: Introduciton

The female reproductive system regulates the hormonal changes responsible for puberty and adult reproductive function. Normal reproductive function in women requires the dynamic integration of hormonal signals from the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovary, resulting in repetitive cycles of follicle development, ovulation, and preparation of the endometrial lining of the uterus for implantation should conception occur.

For further discussion of related topics, see the following chapters: hyperandrogenic disorders (Chap. 49), menstrual cycle disorders (Chap. 50), gynecologic malignancies (Chap. 97), sexually transmitted diseases (Chap. 130), male hormonal contraception (Chap. 346), menopause (Chap. 348), and sexual differentiation (Chap. 349).
 
Development of the Ovary and Early Follicular Growth

The ovary orchestrates the development and release of a mature oocyte and also elaborates hormones (e.g., estrogen, progesterone, inhibin, relaxin) that are critical for pubertal development and preparation of the uterus for conception, implantation, and the early stages of pregnancy. To achieve these functions in repeated monthly cycles, the ovary undergoes some of the most dynamic changes of any organ in the body. Primordial germ cells can be identified by the third week of gestation and their migration to the genital ridge is complete by 6 weeks' gestation. Germ cells persist within the genital ridge, are then referred to as oogonia, and are essential for induction of ovarian development. Although one X chromosome undergoes X inactivation in somatic cells, it is reactivated in oogonia and genes on both X chromosomes are required for normal ovarian development. A streak ovary containing only stromal cells is found in patients with 45,X Turner's syndrome (Chap. 349).

The germ cell population expands, and starting at 8 weeks' gestation, oogonia begin to enter prophase of the first meiotic division and become primary oocytes. This allows the oocyte to be surrounded by a single layer of flattened granulosa cells to form a primordial follicle (Fig. 347-1). Granulosa cells are derived from mesonephric cells that invade the ovary early in its development, pushing the germ cells to the periphery. Although recent studies have reopened the debate, the weight of evidence strongly supports the concept that the ovary contains a nonrenewable pool of germ cells. Through the combined processes of mitosis, meiosis, and atresia, the population of oogonia reaches its maximum of 6每7 million by 20 weeks' gestation, after which there is a progressive loss of both oogonia and primordial follicles through the process of atresia. At birth, oogonia are no longer present in the ovary, and only 1每2 million germ cells remain in the form of primordial follicles (Fig. 347-2). The oocyte persists in prophase of the first meiotic division until just before ovulation, when meiosis resumes.

The quiescent primordial follicles are recruited to further growth and differentiation through a highly regulated process that limits the size of the developing cohort to ensure that folliculogenesis can continue throughout the reproductive life span. This initial recruitment of primordial follicles to form primary follicles (Fig. 347-1) is characterized by growth of the oocyte and the transition from squamous to cuboidal granulosa cells. The theca interna cells that surround the developing follicle begin to form as the primary follicle grows. Acquisition of a zona pellucida by the oocyte and the presence of several layers of surrounding cuboidal granulosa cells mark the development of secondary follicles. It is at this stage that granulosa cells develop follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol, and androgen receptors and communicate with one another through the development of gap junctions.

Bidirectional signaling between the germ cells and the somatic cells in the ovary are a necessary component underlying the maturation of the oocyte and the capacity for hormone secretion. For example, the oocyte-derived factor in the germline(FIG) is required for initial follicle formation. Anti-m邦llerian hormone [AMH, also known as mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS)] and activins derived from somatic cells induce the development of primary follicles from primordial follicles. Oocyte-derived growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF-9) is required for migration of pre-theca cells to the outer surface of the developing follicle. GDF-9 is also required for formation of secondary follicles, as are granulosa cell每derived KIT ligand (KITL) and the forkhead transcription factor (FOXL2). All of these genes are potential candidates for premature ovarian failure in women, and mutations in the human FOXL2 gene have been shown to cause the syndrome of blepharophimosis/ ptosis/epicanthus inversus, which is associated with ovarian failure.
 
Development of a Mature Follicle

The early stages of follicle growth are primarily driven by intraovarian factors and may take up to a year from the time of initial recruitment. Maturation to the state required for ovulation, including the resumption of meiosis in the oocyte, requires the combined stimulus of FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) (Fig. 347-1) and can be accomplished within weeks. This phase of recruitment of secondary follicles from the resting follicle pool requires the direct action of FSH. Accumulation of follicular fluid between the layers of granulosa cells creates an antrum that divides the granulosa cells into two functionally distinct groups: mural cells that line the follicle wall and cumulus cells that surround the oocyte (Fig. 347-3). Recent evidence suggests that, in addition to its role in normal development of the mullerian system, the WNT signaling pathway is required for normal antral follicle development and may also play a role in ovarian steroidogenesis. A single dominant follicle emerges from the growing follicle pool within the first 5每7 days after the onset of menses, and the majority of follicles fall off their growth trajectory and become atretic. Autocrine actions of activin and bone morphogenic protein 6 (BMP-6), derived from the granulosa cells, and paracrine actions of GDF-9, BMP-15, BMP-6, and Gpr149, derived from the oocyte, are involved in granulosa cell proliferation and modulation of FSH responsiveness. Differential exposure to these factors may explain why one follicle is selected for continued growth to the preovulatory stage. The dominant follicle can be distinguished by its size, evidence of granulosa cell proliferation, large number of FSH receptors, high aromatase activity, and elevated concentrations of estradiol and inhibin A in follicular fluid.

The dominant follicle undergoes rapid expansion during the 5每6 days prior to ovulation, reflecting granulosa cell proliferation and accumulation of follicular fluid. FSH induces LH receptors on the granulosa cells, and the preovulatory, or Graffian, follicle moves to the outer ovarian surface in preparation for ovulation. The LH surge triggers the resumption of meiosis, the suppression of granulosa cell proliferation, and the induction of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), prostaglandins, and the progesterone receptor, each of which is required for ovulation. EGF-like factors are thought to mediate these follicular responses to LH. Ovulation also involves production of extracellular matrix leading to expansion of the cumulus cell population that surrounds the oocyte and the controlled expulsion of the egg and follicular fluid. Both progesterone and prostaglandins (induced by the ovulatory stimulus) are essential for this process. After ovulation, luteinization is induced by LH in conjunction with the acquisition of a rich vascular network in response to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (basic FGF). Traditional regulators of central reproductive control, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and its receptor (GnRHR), are also produced in the ovary and may be involved in corpus luteum function.
 
Regulation of Ovarian Function

Hypothalamic and Pituitary Secretion

GnRH neurons develop from epithelial cells outside the central nervous system and migrate, initially alongside the olfactory neurons, to the medial basal hypothalamus. Studies in GnRH-deficient patients who fail to undergo puberty have provided insights into genes that control the ontogeny and function of GnRH neurons (Fig. 347-4). KAL1, FGF8/FGFR1, PROK2/PROKR2, NELF and CDH7 (Chap. 346) have been implicated in the migration of GnRH neurons to the hypothalamus. Approximately 7000 GnRH neurons, scattered throughout the medial basal hypothalamus, establish contacts with capillaries of the pituitary portal system in the median eminence. GnRH is secreted into the pituitary portal system in discrete pulses to stimulate synthesis and secretion of LH and FSH from pituitary gonadotropes, which comprise 10% of cells in the pituitary (Chap. 339). Functional connections of GnRH neurons with the portal system are established by the end of the first trimester, coinciding with the production of pituitary gonadotropins. Thus, like the ovary, the hypothalamic and pituitary components of the reproductive system are present before birth. However, the high levels of estradiol and progesterone produced by the placenta suppress hypothalamic-pituitary stimulation of ovarian hormonal secretion in the fetus.

Figure 347-4

 
 
 
Establishment of a functional GnRH system requires the participation of a number of genes that are essential for development and migration of GnRH neurons from the olfactory placode to the hypothalamus in addition to genes involved in the functional control of GnRH secretion and action.
 
 


After birth and the loss of placenta-derived steroids, gonadotropin levels rise. FSH levels are much higher in girls than in boys. This rise in FSH results in ovarian activation (evident on ultrasound) and increased inhibin B and estradiol levels. Studies that have identified mutations in TAC3, which encodes neurokinin B, and its receptor, TAC3R, in patients with GnRH deficiency indicate that both are involved in control of GnRH secretion and may be particularly important at this early stage of development. By 12每20 months of age, the reproductive axis is again suppressed, and a period of relative quiescence persists until puberty (Fig. 347-5). At the onset of puberty, pulsatile GnRH secretion induces pituitary gonadotropin production. In the early stages of puberty, LH and FSH secretion are apparent only during sleep, but as puberty develops, pulsatile gonadotropin secretion occurs throughout the day and night.

Figure 347-5

 
 
 
Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) are increased during the neonatal years but go through a period of childhood quiescence before increasing again during puberty. Gonadotropin levels are cyclic during the reproductive years and increase dramatically with the loss of negative feedback that accompanies menopause.
 
 

The mechanisms responsible for the childhood quiescence and pubertal reactivation of the reproductive axis remain incompletely understood. GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus respond to both excitatory and inhibitory factors. Increased sensitivity to the inhibitory influence of gonadal steroids has long been implicated in the inhibition of GnRH secretion during childhood but has not been definitively established in the human. Metabolic signals such as adipocyte-derived leptin, play a permissive role in reproductive function (Chap. 77). Studies of patients with isolated GnRH deficiency reveal that mutations in the G protein每coupled receptor 54 (GPR54) gene (now known as KISS1R) preclude the onset of puberty. The ligand for this receptor, metastin, is derived from the parent peptide, kisspeptin-1 (KISS1), and is a powerful stimulant for GnRH release. A potential role for kisspeptin in the onset of puberty has been suggested by upregulation of KISS1 and KISS1R transcripts in the hypothalamus at the time of puberty. The KISS1/KISS1R system may also be involved in estrogen feedback regulation of GnRH secretion.

Ovarian Steroids

Ovarian steroid-producing cells do not store hormones but produce them in response to LH and FSH during the normal menstrual cycle. The sequence of steps and the enzymes involved in the synthesis of steroid hormones are similar in the ovary, adrenal, and testis. However, the enzymes required to catalyze specific steps are compartmentalized and may not be abundant or even present in all cell types. Within the developing ovarian follicle, estrogen synthesis from cholesterol requires close integration between theca and granulosa cells〞sometimes called the two-cell model for steroidogenesis(Fig. 347-6). FSH receptors are confined to the granulosa cells, whereas LH receptors are restricted to the theca cells until the late stages of follicular development, when they are also found on granulosa cells. The theca cells surrounding the follicle are highly vascularized and use cholesterol, derived primarily from circulating lipoproteins, as the starting point for the synthesis of androstenedione and testosterone under the control of LH. Androstenedione and testosterone are transferred across the basal lamina to the granulosa cells, which receive no direct blood supply. The mural granulosa cells are particularly rich in aromatase and, under the control of FSH, produce estradiol, the primary steroid secreted from the follicular phase ovary and the most potent estrogen. Theca cell每produced androstenedione and, to a lesser extent, testosterone are also secreted into peripheral blood, where they can be converted to dihydrotestosterone in skin and to estrogens in adipose tissue. The hilar interstitial cells of the ovary are functionally similar to Leydig cells and are also capable of secreting androgens. Although stromal cells proliferate in response to androgens [as in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)], they do not secrete androgens.

Estrogen production in the ovary requires the cooperative function of the theca and granulosa cells under the control of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). HSD, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; OHP, hydroxyprogesterone.
 
 

Development of the rich capillary network following rupture of the follicle at the time of ovulation makes it possible for large molecules such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to reach the luteinized granulosa and theca lutein cells. As in the follicle, both cell types are required for steroidogenesis in the corpus luteum. The luteinized granulosa cells are the main source of progesterone production whereas the theca lutein cells produce 17-hydroxyprogesterone, a substrate for aromatization to estradiol by the luteinized granulosa cells. LH is critical for normal structure and function of the corpus luteum. Because LH and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) bind to a common receptor, the role of LH in support of the corpus luteum can be replaced by hCG in the first 10 weeks after conception, and hCG is commonly used for luteal phase support in the treatment of infertility.

Steroid Hormone Actions

Both estrogen and progesterone play critical roles in the expression of secondary sexual characteristics in women (Chap. 338). Estrogen promotes development of the ductule system in the breast, whereas progesterone is responsible for glandular development. In the reproductive tract, estrogens create a receptive environment for fertilization and support pregnancy and parturition through carefully coordinated changes in the endometrium, thickening of the vaginal mucosa, thinning of the cervical mucus, and uterine growth and contractions. Progesterone induces secretory activity in the estrogen-primed endometrium, increases the viscosity of cervical mucus, and inhibits uterine contractions. Both gonadal steroids play critical roles in the negative and positive feedback controls of gonadotropin secretion. Progesterone also increases basal body temperature and has therefore been used clinically as a marker of ovulation.

The vast majority of circulating estrogens and androgens are carried in the blood bound to carrier proteins, which restrain their free diffusion into cells and prolong their clearance, serving as a reservoir. High-affinity binding proteins include sex hormone每binding globulin (SHBG), which binds androgens with somewhat greater affinity than estrogens, and corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), which also binds progesterone. Modulations in binding protein levels by insulin, androgens, and estrogens contribute to high bioavailable testosterone levels in PCOS and to high circulating estrogen and progesterone levels during pregnancy.

Estrogens act primarily through binding to the nuclear receptors, estrogen receptor (ER)  and . Transcriptional coactivators and co-repressors modulate ER action (Chap. 338). Both ER subtypes are present in the hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary, and reproductive tract. Although ER and - exhibit some functional redundancy, there is also a high degree of specificity, particularly in cell type expression. For example, ER functions in the ovarian theca cells, whereas ER is critical for granulosa cell function. There is also evidence for membrane-initiated signaling by estrogen. Similar signaling mechanisms pertain for progesterone with evidence of transcriptional regulation through progesterone receptor (PR) A and B protein isoforms, as well as rapid membrane signaling.

Ovarian Peptides

Inhibin was initially isolated from gonadal fluids based on its ability to selectively inhibit FSH secretion from pituitary cells. Inhibin is a heterodimer composed of an -subunit and a A- or B-subunit to form inhibin A or inhibin B, both of which are secreted from the ovary. Activin is a homodimer of inhibin  subunits with the capacity to stimulate the synthesis and secretion of FSH. Inhibins and activins are members of the transforming growth factor  (TGF-) superfamily of growth and differentiation factors. During the purification of inhibin, follistatin, an unrelated monomeric protein that inhibits FSH secretion, was discovered. Within the pituitary, follistatin inhibits FSH secretion indirectly through binding and neutralizing activin.

Inhibin B is secreted from the granulosa cells of small antral follicles, whereas inhibin A is present in both granulosa and theca cells and is secreted by dominant follicles. Inhibin A is also present in luteinized granulosa cells and is a major secretory product of the corpus luteum. Inhibin B is constitutively secreted by granulosa cells and increases in serum in conjunction with cycle recruitment to the pool of actively growing follicles under the control of FSH. Inhibin B has been used clinically as a marker of ovarian reserve. Inhibin B is an important inhibitor of FSH, independent of estradiol, during the menstrual cycle. Although activin is also secreted from the ovary, the excess of follistatin in serum, combined with its nearly irreversible binding of activin, make it unlikely that ovarian activin plays an endocrine role in FSH regulation. However, there is evidence that activin plays an autocrine/paracrine role in the ovary, in addition to its intrapituitary role in modulation of FSH production.

AMH (also known as MIS) is important in ovarian biology in addition to the function from which it derived it name (i.e., promotion of the degeneration of the m邦llerian system during embryogenesis in the male). AMH is produced by granulosa cells and, like inhibin B, is a marker of ovarian reserve. AMH may also inhibit the recruitment of primordial follicles into the follicle pool and appears to increase the effect of FSH on aromatase expression.

Relaxin, which is produced by the theca lutein cells of the corpus luteum, is thought to play a role in decidualization of the endometrium and suppression of myometrial contractile activity, both of which are essential for the early establishment of pregnancy.
 
Hormonal Integration of the Normal Menstrual Cycle

The sequence of changes responsible for mature reproductive function is coordinated through a series of negative and positive feedback loops that alter pulsatile GnRH secretion, the pituitary response to GnRH, and the relative secretion of LH and FSH from the gonadotrope. The frequency and amplitude of pulsatile GnRH secretion differentially modulate the synthesis and secretion of LH and FSH, with slow frequencies favoring FSH synthesis and increased amplitudes favoring LH synthesis. Activin is produced in both pituitary gonadotropes and folliculostellate cells and stimulates the synthesis and secretion of FSH. Inhibins function as potent antagonists of activins through sequestration of the activin receptors. Although inhibin is expressed in the pituitary, gonadal inhibin is the principal source of feedback inhibition of FSH.

For the majority of the cycle, the reproductive system functions in a classic endocrine negative feedback mode. Estradiol and progesterone inhibit GnRH secretion, and the inhibins act at the pituitary to selectively inhibit FSH synthesis and secretion (Fig. 347-7). This negative feedback control of FSH is critical for development of the single mature oocyte that characterizes normal reproductive function in women. In addition to these negative feedback controls, the menstrual cycle is uniquely dependent on estrogen-induced positive feedback to produce an LH surge that is essential for ovulation of a mature follicle. The neural signaling pathways that distinguish estrogen negative versus positive feedback are incompletely understood.

Figure 347-7

 
 
 
The reproductive system in women is critically dependent on both negative feedback of gonadal steroids and inhibin to modulate follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion and on estrogen positive feedback to generate the preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
 
 

The Follicular Phase

The follicular phase is characterized by recruitment of a cohort of secondary follicles and the ultimate selection of a dominant preovulatory follicle (Fig. 347-8). The follicular phase begins, by convention, on the first day of menses. However, follicle recruitment is initiated by the rise in FSH that begins in the late luteal phase in conjunction with the loss of negative feedback of gonadal steroids and likely inhibin A. The fact that a 20每30% increase in FSH is adequate for follicular recruitment speaks to the marked sensitivity of the resting follicle pool to FSH. The resultant granulosa cell proliferation is responsible for increasing early follicular phase levels of inhibin B. Inhibin B in conjunction with rising levels of estradiol, and probably inhibin A, restrain FSH secretion during this critical period such that only a single follicle matures in the vast majority of cycles. The increased risk of multiple gestation associated with the increased levels of FSH characteristic of advanced maternal age, or with exogenous gonadotropin administration in the treatment of infertility, attest to the importance of the negative feedback regulation of FSH. With further growth of the dominant follicle, estradiol and inhibin A increase exponentially and the follicle acquires LH receptors. Increasing levels of estradiol are responsible for proliferative changes in the endometrium. The exponential rise in estradiol results in positive feedback on the pituitary, leading to the generation of an LH surge (and a smaller FSH surge), thereby triggering ovulation and luteinization of the granulosa cells.

The Luteal Phase

The luteal phase begins with the formation of the corpus luteum from the ruptured follicle. Progesterone and inhibin A are produced from the luteinized granulosa cells, which continue to aromatize theca-derived androgen precursors, producing estradiol. The combined actions of estrogen and progesterone are responsible for the secretory changes in the endometrium that are necessary for implantation. The corpus luteum is supported by LH but has a finite life span because of diminished sensitivity to LH. The demise of the corpus luteum results in a progressive decline in hormonal support of the endometrium. Inflammation or local hypoxia and ischemia result in vascular changes in the endometrium leading to the release of cytokines, cell death, and shedding of the endometrium.

If conception occurs, hCG produced by the trophoblast binds to LH receptors on the corpus luteum, maintaining steroid hormone production and preventing involution of the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum is essential for the hormonal maintenance of the endometrium during the first 6每10 weeks of pregnancy until this function is taken over by the placenta.
 
Clinical Assessment of Ovarian Function

Menstrual bleeding should become regular within 2 to 4 years of menarche, although anovulatory and irregular cycles are common before that. For the remainder of adult reproductive life, the cycle length counted from the first day of menses to the first day of subsequent menses, is 28 days, with a range of 25每35 days. However, cycle-to-cycle variability for an individual woman is ㊣2 days. Luteal phase length is relatively constant between 12 and 14 days in normal cycles; thus, the major variability in cycle length is due to variations in the follicular phase. The duration of menstrual bleeding in ovulatory cycles varies between 4 and 6 days. There is a gradual shortening of cycle length with age such that women over the age of 35 have cycles that are shorter than during their younger reproductive years. Anovulatory cycles increase as women approach the menopause, and bleeding patterns may be erratic.

Women who report regular monthly bleeding with cycles that do not vary by >4 days generally have ovulatory cycles, but several other clinical signs can be used to assess the likelihood of ovulation. Some women experience mittelschmerz, described as midcycle pelvic discomfort that is thought to be caused by the rapid expansion of the dominant follicle at the time of ovulation. A constellation of premenstrual moliminal symptoms such as bloating, breast tenderness, and food cravings often occur several days before menses in ovulatory cycles, but their absence cannot be used as evidence of anovulation. Methods that can be used to determine whether ovulation is likely to include a serum progesterone level >5 ng/mL 7 days before expected menses, an increase in basal body temperature of 0.24∼C (>0.5∼F) in the second half of the cycle due to the thermoregulatory effect of progesterone, or the detection of the urinary LH surge using ovulation predictor kits. Because ovulation occurs 36 hours after the LH surge, urinary LH can be helpful in timing intercourse to coincide with ovulation.

Ultrasound can be used to detect the growth of the fluid-filled antrum of the developing follicle and to assess endometrial proliferation in response to increasing estradiol levels in the follicular phase, as well as the characteristic echogenicity of the secretory endometrium of the luteal phase.
 
Puberty

Normal Pubertal Development in Girls

The first menstrual period (menarche) occurs relatively late in the series of developmental milestones that characterize normal pubertal development (Table 347-1). Menarche is preceded by the appearance of pubic and then axillary hair as a result of maturation of the zona reticularis in the adrenal gland and increased adrenal androgen secretion, particularly dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). The triggers for adrenarche remain unknown but may involve increases in body mass index as well as in utero and neonatal factors. Menarche is also preceded by breast development (thelarche), which is exquisitely sensitive to the very low levels of estrogen that result from peripheral conversion of adrenal androgens and the low levels of estrogen secreted from the ovary early in pubertal maturation. Breast development precedes the appearance of pubic and axillary hair in 60% of girls. The interval between the onset of breast development and menarche is 2 years. There has been a gradual decline in the age of menarche over the past century, attributed in large part to improvement in nutrition, and there is a relationship between adiposity and earlier sexual maturation in girls. In the United States, menarche occurs at an average age of 12.5 years (Table 347-1). Much of the variation in the timing of puberty is due to genetic factors, with heritability estimates of 50每80%. Both adrenarche and breast development occur 1 year earlier in black compared with white girls, although the timing of menarche differs by only 6 months between these ethnic groups.

Other important hormonal changes also occur in conjunction with puberty. Growth hormone (GH) levels increase early in puberty, stimulated in part by the pubertal increases in estrogen secretion. GH increases insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), which enhances linear growth. The growth spurt is generally less pronounced in girls than in boys, with a peak growth velocity of 7 cm/year. Linear growth is ultimately limited by closure of epiphyses in the long bones as a result of prolonged exposure to estrogen. Puberty is also associated with mild insulin resistance.

Disorders of Puberty

The differential diagnosis of precocious and delayed puberty is similar in boys (Chap. 346) and girls. However, there are differences in the timing of normal puberty and differences in the relative frequency of specific disorders in girls compared with boys.

Precocious Puberty

Traditionally, precocious puberty has been defined as the development of secondary sexual characteristics before the age of 8 in girls based on data from Marshall and Tanner in British girls studied in the 1960s. More recent studies led to recommendations that girls be evaluated for precocious puberty if breast development or pubic hair are present at <7 years of age for white girls or <6 years for black girls.

Precocious puberty is most often centrally mediated (Table 347-2), resulting from early activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. It is characterized by pulsatile LH secretion and an enhanced LH and FSH response to exogenous GnRH (two- to threefold stimulation) (Table 347-3). True precocity is marked by advancement in bone age of >2 SD, a recent history of growth acceleration, and progression of secondary sexual characteristics. In girls, centrally mediated precocious puberty is idiopathic in 85% of cases; however, neurogenic causes must also be considered. GnRH agonists that induce pituitary desensitization are the mainstay of treatment to prevent premature epiphyseal closure and preserve adult height, as well as to manage psychosocial repercussions of precocious puberty.

Peripherally mediated precocious puberty does not involve activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and is characterized by suppressed gonadotropins in the presence of elevated estradiol. Management of peripheral precocious puberty involves treating the underlying disorder (Table 347-2) and limiting the effects of gonadal steroids using aromatase inhibitors, inhibitors of steroidogenesis, and estrogen receptor blockers. It is important to be aware that central precocious puberty can also develop in girls whose precocity was initially peripherally mediated, as in McCune-Albright syndrome and congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

Incomplete and intermittent forms of precocious puberty may also occur. For example, premature breast development may occur in girls before the age of 2 years, with no further progression and without significant advancement in bone age, androgen production, or compromised height. Premature adrenarche can also occur in the absence of progressive pubertal development, but it must be distinguished from late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia and androgen-secreting tumors, in which case it may be termed heterosexual precocity. Premature adrenarche may be associated with obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and the subsequent predisposition to PCOS.

Delayed Puberty

Delayed puberty (Table 347-4) is defined as the absence of secondary sexual characteristics by age 13 in girls. The diagnostic considerations are very similar to those for primary amenorrhea (Chap. 50). Between 25 and 40% of delayed puberty in girls is of ovarian origin, with Turner's syndrome accounting for the majority of such patients. Functional hypogonadotropic hypogonadism encompasses diverse etiologies such as systemic illnesses, including celiac disease and chronic renal disease, and endocrinopathies such as diabetes and hypothyroidism. In addition, girls appear to be particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of abnormalities in energy balance that result from exercise, dieting, and/or eating disorders. Together these reversible conditions account for 25% of delayed puberty in girls. Congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in girls or boys can be caused by mutations in several different genes or combinations of genes (Fig. 347-4, Chap. 346, Table 346-2). Family studies suggest that genes identified in association with absent puberty may also cause delayed puberty, and recent reports have further suggested that a genetic susceptibility to environmental stresses such as diet and exercise may account for at least some cases of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea. Although neuroanatomic causes of delayed puberty are considerably less common in girls than in boys, it is always important to rule these out in the setting of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

Infertility

Definition and Prevalence

Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive after 12 months of unprotected sexual intercourse. In a study of 5574 English and American women who ultimately conceived, pregnancy occurred in 50% within 3 months, 72% within 6 months, and 85% within 12 months. These findings are consistent with predictions based on fecundability, the probability of achieving pregnancy in one menstrual cycle (approximately 20每25% in healthy young couples). Assuming a fecundability of 0.25, 98% of couples should conceive within 13 months. Based on this definition, the National Survey of Family Growth reports a 14% rate of infertility in the United States in married women aged 15每44. The infertility rate has remained relatively stable over the past 30 years, although the proportion of couples without children has risen, reflecting a trend to delay childbearing. This trend has important implications because of an age-related decrease in fecundability, which begins at age 35 and decreases markedly after age 40. It is estimated that 8% of women in the United States have received medical assistance for infertility; of these, 74% received counseling, 60% underwent infertility testing of the female and/or male partner, and 46% used ovulation-inducing medication.

Causes of Infertility

The spectrum of infertility ranges from reduced conception rates or the need for medical intervention to irreversible causes of infertility. Infertility can be attributed primarily to male factors in 25%, female factors in 58%, and is unexplained in about 17% of couples (Fig. 347-9). Not uncommonly, both male and female factors contribute to infertility.

Approach to the Patient: Infertility


Initial Evaluation

In all couples presenting with infertility, the initial evaluation includes discussion of the appropriate timing of intercourse and discussion of modifiable risk factors such as smoking, alcohol, caffeine, and obesity. The range of required investigations should be reviewed as well as a brief description of infertility treatment options, including adoption. Initial investigations are focused on determining whether the primary cause of the infertility is male, female, or both. These investigations include a semen analysis in the male, confirmation of ovulation in the female, and, in the majority of situations, documentation of tubal patency in the female. In some cases, after an extensive workup excluding all male and female factors, a specific cause cannot be identified and infertility may ultimately be classified as unexplained.

Psychological Aspects of Infertility

Infertility is invariably associated with psychological stress related not only to the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures themselves but also to repeated cycles of hope and loss associated with each new procedure or cycle of treatment that does not result in the birth of a child. These feelings are often combined with a sense of isolation from friends and family. Counseling and stress-management techniques should be introduced early in the evaluation of infertility. Importantly, infertility and its treatment do not appear to be associated with long-term psychological sequelae.

Female Causes

Abnormalities in menstrual function constitute the most common cause of female infertility. These disorders, which include ovulatory dysfunction and abnormalities of the uterus or outflow tract, may present as amenorrhea or as irregular or short menstrual cycles. A careful history and physical examination and a limited number of laboratory tests will help to determine whether the abnormality is: (1) hypothalamic or pituitary (low FSH, LH, and estradiol with or without an increase in prolactin), (2) PCOS (irregular cycles and hyperandrogenism in the absence of other causes of androgen excess), (3) ovarian (low estradiol with increased FSH), or (4) uterine or outflow tract abnormality. The frequency of these diagnoses depends on whether the amenorrhea is primary or occurs after normal puberty and menarche (see Fig. 50-2).

The approach to further evaluation of these disorders is described in detail in Chap. 50.

Ovulatory Dysfunction

In women with a history of regular menstrual cycles, evidence of ovulation should be sought as described above. An endometrial biopsy to exclude luteal phase insufficiency is no longer considered a usual part of the infertility workup. Even in the presence of ovulatory cycles, evaluation of ovarian reserve is recommended for women aged >35 years. Measurement of FSH on day 3 of the cycle (an FSH level <10 IU/mL on cycle day 3 predicts adequate ovarian oocyte reserve) or in response to clomiphene (blocks estrogen negative feedback on FSH), antral follicle count and serum levels of inhibin B and AMH have all been used for this purpose.

Tubal Disease

Tubal dysfunction may result from pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), appendicitis, endometriosis, pelvic adhesions, tubal surgery, previous use of an intrauterine device (IUD), and a previous ectopic pregnancy. However, a cause is not identified in up to 50% of patients with documented tubal factor infertility. Because of the high prevalence of tubal disease, evaluation of tubal patency by hysterosalpingogram (HSG) or laparoscopy should occur early in the majority of couples with infertility. Subclinical infections with Chlamydia trachomatis may be an underdiagnosed cause of tubal infertility and requires the treatment of both partners.

Endometriosis

Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial glands or stroma outside the endometrial cavity and uterine musculature. Its presence is suggested by a history of dyspareunia (painful intercourse), worsening dysmenorrhea that often begins before menses, or by a thickened rectovaginal septum or deviation of the cervix on pelvic examination. The pathogenesis of the infertility associated with endometriosis is unclear but may involve effects on fertilization, normal function of the endometrium, as well as adhesions. Endometriosis is often clinically silent, however, and can only be excluded definitively by laparoscopy.

Male Causes

(See also Chap. 346) Known causes of male infertility include primary testicular disease, disorders of sperm transport, and hypothalamic-pituitary disease resulting in secondary hypogonadism. However, the etiology is not ascertained in up to one-half of men with suspected male factor infertility. The key initial diagnostic test is a semen analysis. Testosterone levels should be measured if the sperm count is low on repeated examination or if there is clinical evidence of hypogonadism. Gonadotropin levels will help to determine a gonadal versus a central cause of hypogonadism.

Treatment: Infertility

In addition to addressing the negative impact of smoking on fertility and pregnancy outcome, counseling about nutrition and weight is a critical part of infertility and pregnancy management. Both low and increased body mass index (BMI) are associated with infertility in women and with increased morbidity during pregnancy. Obesity has also been associated with infertility in men. The treatment of infertility should be tailored to the problems unique to each couple. In many situations, including unexplained infertility, mild-to-moderate endometriosis, and/or borderline semen parameters, a stepwise approach to infertility is optimal, beginning with low-risk interventions and moving to more invasive, higher risk interventions only if necessary. After determination of all infertility factors and their correction, if possible, this approach might include, in increasing order of complexity: (1) expectant management, (2) clomiphene citrate (see below) with or without intrauterine insemination (IUI), (3) gonadotropins with or without IUI, and (4) in vitro fertilization (IVF). The time used to complete the evaluation, correction, and expectant management can be longer in women aged <30 years, but this process should be advanced rapidly in women aged >35 years. In some situations, expectant management will not be appropriate.

Ovulatory Dysfunction

Treatment of ovulatory dysfunction should first be directed at identification of the etiology of the disorder to allow specific management when possible. Dopamine agonists, for example, may be indicated in patients with hyperprolactinemia (Chap. 339); lifestyle modification may be successful in women with obesity, low body weight, or a history of intensive exercise (Chap. 79).

Medications used for ovulation induction include clomiphene citrate, gonadotropins, and pulsatile GnRH. Clomiphene citrate is a nonsteroidal estrogen antagonist that increases FSH and LH levels by blocking estrogen negative feedback at the hypothalamus. The efficacy of clomiphene for ovulation induction is highly dependent on patient selection. It induces ovulation in 60% of women with PCOS and is the initial treatment of choice. It may be combined with agents that modify insulin levels such as metformin. Clomiphene citrate is less successful in patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Aromatase inhibitors have also been investigated for the treatment of infertility. Initial studies are promising, but these medications have not been approved for this indication.

Gonadotropins are highly effective for ovulation induction in women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and PCOS and are used to induce the development of multiple follicles in unexplained infertility and in older reproductive-age women. Disadvantages include a significant risk of multiple gestation and the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation. Careful monitoring and a conservative approach to ovarian stimulation reduce these risks. Currently available gonadotropins include urinary preparations of LH and FSH, highly purified FSH, and recombinant FSH. Though FSH is the key component, there are growing data that the addition of some LH (or hCG) may improve results and this is particularly important in hypogonadotropic patients.

None of these methods are effective in women with premature ovarian failure in whom donor oocyte or adoption are the methods of choice.

Tubal Disease

If hysterosalpingography suggests a tubal or uterine cavity abnormality, or if a patient is aged 35 at the time of initial evaluation, laparoscopy with tubal lavage is recommended, often with a hysteroscopy. Although tubal reconstruction may be attempted if tubal disease is identified, it is generally being replaced by the use of IVF. These patients are at increased risk of developing an ectopic pregnancy.

Endometriosis

Though 60% of women with minimal or mild endometriosis may conceive within 1 year without treatment, laparoscopic resection or ablation appears to improve conception rates. Medical management of advanced stages of endometriosis is widely used for symptom control but has not been shown to enhance fertility. In moderate-to-severe endometriosis, conservative surgery is associated with pregnancy rates of 50 and 39%, respectively, compared with rates of 25 and 5% with expectant management alone. In some patients, IVF may be the treatment of choice.

Male Factor Infertility

The treatment options for male factor infertility have expanded greatly in recent years (Chap. 346). Secondary hypogonadism is highly amenable to treatment with pulsatile GnRH or gonadotropins. In vitro techniques have provided new opportunities for patients with primary testicular failure and disorders of sperm transport. Choice of initial treatment options depends on sperm concentration and motility. Expectant management should be attempted initially in men with mild male factor infertility (sperm count of 15 to 20 x 106/mL and normal motility). Moderate male factor infertility (10 to 15 x 106/mL and 20每40% motility) should begin with IUI alone or in combination with treatment of the female partner with clomiphene or gonadotropins, but it may require IVF with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). For men with a severe defect (sperm count of <10 x 106/mL, 10% motility), IVF with ICSI or donor sperm should be used. If ICSI is performed because of azoospermia due to congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, genetic testing and counseling should be provided because of the risk of cystic fibrosis.

Assisted Reproductive Technologies

The development of assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) has dramatically altered the treatment of male and female infertility. IVF is indicated for patients with many causes of infertility that have not been successfully managed with more conservative approaches. IVF or ICSI is often the treatment of choice in couples with a significant male factor or tubal disease, whereas IVF using donor oocytes is used in patients with premature ovarian failure and in women of advanced reproductive age. Success rates depend on the age of the woman and the cause of the infertility. The number of cycles canceled increases from approximately 10% in women aged <35 years to 24% in women aged >40 while the birth rate decreases from 39% of cycles in which embryos were transferred in women aged <35 to 24% in women aged 38-40 and only 10% in women aged >40. Though often effective, IVF is expensive and requires careful monitoring of ovulation induction and invasive techniques, including the aspiration of multiple follicles. IVF is associated with a significant risk of multiple gestation, particularly in women aged <35, in whom it can be as high as 40%.
 
Contraception

Only 15% of couples in the United States report having unprotected sexual intercourse in the past 3 months. However, despite the wide availability and widespread use of a variety of effective methods of contraception, approximately one-half of all births in the United States are the result of unintended pregnancy. Teenage pregnancies continue to represent a serious public health problem in the United States, with >1 million unintended pregnancies each year〞a significantly greater incidence than in other industrialized nations.

Of the contraceptive methods available (Table 347-5), a reversible form of contraception is used by >50% of couples, while sterilization (male or female) has been employed as a permanent form of contraception by over one-third of couples. Pregnancy termination is relatively safe when directed by health care professionals, but is rarely the option of choice.

No single contraceptive method is ideal, although all are safer than carrying a pregnancy to term. The effectiveness of a given method of contraception does not just depend on the efficacy of the method itself. Discrepancies between theoretical and actual effectiveness emphasize the importance of patient education and compliance when considering various forms of contraception (Table 347-5). Knowledge of the advantages and disadvantages of each contraceptive is essential for counseling an individual about the methods that are safest and most consistent with his or her lifestyle. The World Health Organization (WHO) has extensive family planning resources for the physician and patient that can be accessed online. Similar resources for determining medical eligibility are available through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Considerations for contraceptive use in obese patients and after bariatric surgery are discussed below.

Barrier Methods

Barrier contraceptives (such as condoms, diaphragms, and cervical caps) and spermicides are easily available, reversible, and have fewer side effects than hormonal methods. However, their effectiveness is highly dependent on adherence and proper use (Table 347-5). A major advantage of barrier contraceptives is the protection provided against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (Chap. 130). Consistent use is associated with a decreased risk of HIV, gonorrhea, nongonococcal urethritis, and genital herpes, probably due in part to the concomitant use of spermicides. Natural membrane condoms may be less effective than latex condoms, and petroleum-based lubricants can degrade condoms and decrease their efficacy for preventing HIV infection. A highly effective female condom, which also provides protection against STIs, was approved in 1994 but has not achieved widespread use.

Sterilization

Sterilization is the method of birth control most frequently chosen by fertile men and multiparous women >30 (Table 347-5). Sterilization refers to a procedure that prevents fertilization by surgical interruption of the fallopian tubes in women or the vas deferens in men. Although tubal ligation and vasectomy are potentially reversible, these procedures should be considered permanent and should not be undertaken without patient counseling.

Several methods of tubal ligation have been developed, all of which are highly effective with a 10-year cumulative pregnancy rate of 1.85 per 100 women. However, when pregnancy does occur, the risk of ectopic pregnancy may be as high as 30%. The success rate of tubal reanastomosis depends on the method used, but even after successful reversal, the risk of ectopic pregnancy remains high. In addition to prevention of pregnancy, tubal ligation reduces the risk of ovarian cancer, possibly by limiting the upward migration of potential carcinogens.

Vasectomy is a highly effective outpatient surgical procedure that has little risk. The development of azoospermia may be delayed for 2每6 months, and other forms of contraception must be used until two sperm-free ejaculations provide proof of sterility. Reanastomosis may restore fertility in 30每50% of men, but the success rate declines with time after vasectomy and may be influenced by factors such as the development of antisperm antibodies.

Intrauterine Devices

IUDs inhibit pregnancy primarily through a spermicidal effect caused by a sterile inflammatory reaction induced by the presence of a foreign body in the uterine cavity (copper IUDs) or by the release of progestins (Progestasert, Mirena). IUDs provide a high level of efficacy in the absence of systemic metabolic effects, and ongoing motivation is not required to ensure efficacy once the device has been placed. However, only 1% of women in the United States use this method compared to a utilization rate of 15每30% in much of Europe and Canada, despite evidence that the newer devices are not associated with increased rates of pelvic infection and infertility, as occurred with earlier devices. An IUD should not be used in women at high risk for development of STI or in women at high risk for bacterial endocarditis. The IUD may not be effective in women with uterine leiomyomas because they alter the size or shape of the uterine cavity. IUD use is associated with increased menstrual blood flow, although this is less pronounced with the progestin-releasing IUD, which is associated with a more frequent occurrence of spotting or amenorrhea.

Hormonal Methods

Oral Contraceptive Pills

Because of their ease of use and efficacy, oral contraceptive pills are the most widely used form of hormonal contraception. They act by suppressing ovulation, changing cervical mucus, and altering the endometrium. The current formulations are made from synthetic estrogens and progestins. The estrogen component of the pill consists of ethinyl estradiol or mestranol, which is metabolized to ethinyl estradiol. Multiple synthetic progestins are used. Norethindrone and its derivatives are used in many formulations. Low-dose norgestimate and the more recently developed progestins (desogestrel, gestodene, drospirenone) have a less androgenic profile; levonorgestrel appears to be the most androgenic of the progestins and should be avoided in patients with hyperandrogenic symptoms. The three major formulations of oral contraceptives are (1) fixed-dose estrogen-progestin combination, (2) phasic estrogen-progestin combination, and (3) progestin only. Each of these formulations is administered daily for 3 weeks followed by a week of no medication during which menstrual bleeding generally occurs. Two extended oral contraceptives are approved for use in the United States; Seasonale is a 3-month preparation with 84 days of active drug and 7 days of placebo, and Lybrel is a continuous preparation containing 90 g of levonorgestrel and 20 g of ethinyl estradiol. Current doses of ethinyl estradiol range from 20 to 50 g. However, indications for the 50-g dose are rare, and the majority of formulations contain 35 g of ethinyl estradiol. The reduced estrogen and progestin content in the second- and third-generation pills has decreased both side effects and risks associated with oral contraceptive use (Table 347-6). At the currently used doses, patients must be cautioned not to miss pills due to the potential for ovulation. Side effects, including breakthrough bleeding, amenorrhea, breast tenderness, and weight gain, often respond to a change in formulation.

Abbreviation: OCP, oral contraceptive pill.
 

The microdose progestin-only minipill is less effective as a contraceptive, having a pregnancy rate of 2每7 per 100 women-years. However, it may be appropriate for women with cardiovascular disease or for women who cannot tolerate synthetic estrogens.

New Methods

A weekly contraceptive patch (Ortho Evra) is available and has similar efficacy to oral contraceptives but may be associated with less breakthrough bleeding. Approximately 2% of patches fail to adhere, and a similar percentage of women have skin reactions. Efficacy is lower in women weighing >90 kg. The amount of estrogen delivered may be comparable to that of a 40-g ethinyl estradiol oral contraceptive, raising the possibility of increased risk of venous thromboembolism, which must be balanced against potential benefits for women not able to successfully use other methods. A monthly contraceptiveestrogen/progestin injection (Lunelle) is highly effective, with a first-year failure rate of <0.2%, but it may be less effective in obese women. Its use is associated with bleeding irregularities that diminish over time. Fertility returns rapidly after discontinuation. A monthly vaginal ring (NuvaRing) that is intended to be left in place during intercourse is also available for contraceptive use. It is highly effective, with a 12-month failure rate of 0.7%. Ovulation returns within the first recovery cycle after discontinuation.

Long-Term Contraceptives

Long-term progestin administration acts primarily by inhibiting ovulation and causing changes in the endometrium and cervical mucus that result in decreased implantation and sperm transport. Depot Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo Provera, DMPA), the only injectable form available in the United States, is effective for 3 months, but return of fertility after discontinuation may be delayed for up to 12每18 months. DMPA is now available for both SC and IM injection. Irregular bleeding, amenorrhea, and weight gain are the most common side effects. This form of contraception may be particularly good for women in whom an estrogen-containing contraceptive is contraindicated (e.g., migraine exacerbation, sickle-cell anemia, fibroids).

Postcoital Contraception

Postcoital contraceptive methods prevent implantation or cause regression of the corpus luteum and are highly efficacious if used appropriately. Unprotected intercourse without regard to the time of the month carries an 8% incidence of pregnancy, an incidence that can be reduced to 2% by the use of emergency contraceptives within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. A notice published in 1997 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indicated that certain oral contraceptive pills could be used within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse [Ovral (2 tablets, 12 hours apart) and Lo/Ovral (4 tablets, 12 hours apart)]. Preven (50 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.25 mg levonorgestrel) and Plan B or Next Choice (0.75 mg levonorgestrel) are now approved for postcoital contraception and are available over the counter for women aged >17 years. Levonorgestrel is more effective and is associated with fewer side effects than the combination estrogen-progestin regimens. Ulipristal acetate is a progesterone antagonist that has been developed for emergency contraception. It is available in Europe and was approved by the FDA for prescription use in 2010. This medication is effective for up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse. Mifepristone is also a progesterone antagonist that is available for medical termination of intrauterine pregnancy but is not approved for emergency contraception in the United States. Insertion of a copper IUD within 5 days after unprotected intercourse is also a highly effective method.

Impact of Obesity on Contraceptive Choice

Approximately one-third of adults in the United States are obese. While obesity is associated with some reduction in fertility, the vast majority of obese women can conceive. The risk of pregnancy-associated complications is higher in obese women. Intrauterine contraception may be more effective than oral or transdermal methods for obese women. The WHO guidelines provide no restrictions (class 1) for the use of intrauterine contraception, DMPA, and progestin-only pills for obese women (BMI 30) in the absence of coexistent medical problems whereas methods that include estrogen (pill, patch, ring) are considered class 2 (advantages generally outweigh theoretical or proven risks) due to the increased risk of thromboembolic disease. There are no restrictions to the use of any contraceptive methods following restrictive bariatric surgery procedures, but both combined and progestin-only pills are relatively less effective following procedures associated with malabsorption.

Chapter 348. The Menopause Transition and Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy >
 

The Menopause Transition and Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy: Introduction

Menopause is the permanent cessation of menstruation due to loss of ovarian follicular function. It is diagnosed retrospectively after 12 months of amenorrhea. The average age at menopause is 51 years among U.S. women. Perimenopause refers to the time period preceding menopause, when fertility wanes and menstrual cycle irregularity increases, until the first year after cessation of menses. The onset of perimenopause precedes the final menses by 2 to 8 years, with a mean duration of four years. Smoking accelerates the menopausal transition by 2 years.

Although the peri- and postmenopausal transitions share many symptoms, the physiology and clinical management differ. Low-dose oral contraceptives have become a therapeutic mainstay in perimenopause, whereas postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) has been a common method of symptom alleviation after menstruation ceases.
 
Perimenopause

Physiology

Ovarian mass and fertility decline sharply after age 35 and even more precipitously during perimenopause; depletion of primary follicles, a process that begins before birth, occurs steadily until menopause (Chap. 347). In perimenopause, intermenstrual intervals shorten significantly (typically by 3 days) due to an accelerated follicular phase. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels rise due to altered folliculogenesis and reduced inhibin secretion. In contrast to the consistently high FSH and low estradiol levels seen in menopause, perimenopause is characterized by "irregularly irregular" hormone levels. The propensity for anovulatory cycles can produce a hyperestrogenic, hypoprogestagenic environment that may account for the increased incidence of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma, uterine polyps, and leiomyoma observed among women of perimenopausal age. Mean serum levels of selected ovarian and pituitary hormones during the menopausal transition are shown in Fig. 348-1. With transition into menopause, estradiol levels fall markedly, whereas estrone levels are relatively preserved, reflecting peripheral aromatization of adrenal and ovarian androgens. FSH levels increase more than those of luteinizing hormone (LH), presumably because of the loss of inhibin, as well as estrogen feedback.

Diagnostic Tests

Because of their extreme intraindividual variability, FSH and estradiol levels are imperfect diagnostic indicators of perimenopause in menstruating women. However, a low FSH in the early follicular phase (days 2 through 5) of the menstrual cycle is inconsistent with a diagnosis of perimenopause. FSH measurement can also aid in assessing fertility; levels of <20 mIU/mL, 20 to <30 mIU/mL, and 30 mIU/mL measured on day 3 of the cycle indicate a good, fair, and poor likelihood of achieving pregnancy, respectively.

Symptoms

Determining whether symptoms that develop in midlife are due to ovarian senescence or to other age-related changes is difficult. There is strong evidence that the menopausal transition can cause hot flashes, night sweats, irregular bleeding, and vaginal dryness, and moderate evidence that it can cause sleep disturbances in some women. There is inconclusive or insufficient evidence that ovarian aging is a major cause of mood swings, depression, impaired memory or concentration, somatic symptoms, urinary incontinence, or sexual dysfunction. In one U.S. study, nearly 60% of women reported hot flashes in the 2 years before their final menses. Symptom intensity, duration, frequency, and effects on quality of life are highly variable.

Treatment: Perimenopause

For women with irregular or heavy menses or hormone-related symptoms that impair quality of life, low-dose combined oral contraceptives are a staple of therapy. Static doses of estrogen and progestin (e.g., 20 g of ethinyl estradiol and 1 mg of norethindrone acetate daily for 21 days each month) can eliminate vasomotor symptoms and restore regular cyclicity. Oral contraceptives provide other benefits, including protection against ovarian and endometrial cancers and increased bone density, although it is not clear whether use during perimenopause decreases fracture risk later in life. Moreover, the contraceptive benefit is important, given that the unintentional pregnancy rate among women in their forties rivals that of adolescents. Contraindications to oral contraceptive use include cigarette smoking, liver disease, a history of thromboembolism or cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, or unexplained vaginal bleeding. Progestin-only formulations (e.g., 0.35 mg norethindrone daily) or medroxyprogesterone (Depo-Provera) injections (e.g., 150 mg IM every 3 months) may provide an alternative for the treatment of perimenopausal menorrhagia in women who smoke or have cardiovascular risk factors. Although progestins neither regularize cycles nor reduce the number of bleeding days, they reduce the volume of menstrual flow.

Nonhormonal strategies to reduce menstrual flow include use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as mefenamic acid (initial dose of 500 mg at start of menses, then 250 mg qid for 2每3 days) or, when medical approaches fail, endometrial ablation. It should be noted that menorrhagia requires an evaluation to rule out uterine disorders. Transvaginal ultrasound with saline enhancement is useful for detecting leiomyomata or polyps, and endometrial aspiration can identify hyperplastic changes.

Transition to Menopause

For sexually active women using contraceptive hormones to alleviate perimenopausal symptoms, the question of when and if to switch to HT must be individualized. Doses of estrogen and progestogen (either synthetic progestins or natural forms of progesterone) in HT are lower than those in oral contraceptives and have not been documented to prevent pregnancy. Although a 1-year absence of spontaneous menses reliably indicates ovulation cessation, it is not possible to assess the natural menstrual pattern while a woman is taking an oral contraceptive. Women willing to switch to a barrier method of contraception should do so; if menses occur spontaneously, oral contraceptive use can be resumed. The average age of final menses among relatives can serve as a guide for when to initiate this process, which can be repeated yearly until menopause has occurred.
 
Menopause and Postmenopausal Hormone

Therapy

One of the most complex health care decisions facing women is whether to use postmenopausal HT. Once prescribed primarily to relieve vasomotor symptoms, HT has been promoted as a strategy to forestall various disorders that accelerate after menopause, including osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. In 2000, nearly 40% of postmenopausal women age 50每74 in the United States had used HT. This widespread use occurred despite the paucity of conclusive data, until recently, on the health consequences of such therapy. Although many women rely on their health care providers for a definitive answer to the question of whether to use postmenopausal hormones, balancing the benefits and risks for an individual patient is challenging.

Although observational studies suggest that HT prevents cardiovascular and other chronic diseases, the apparent benefits may result at least in part from differences between women who opt to take postmenopausal hormones and women who do not. Those choosing HT tend to be healthier, have greater access to medical care, are more compliant with prescribed treatments, and maintain a more health-promoting lifestyle. Randomized trials, which eliminate these confounding factors, have not consistently confirmed the benefits found in observational studies. Indeed, the largest HT trial to date, the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), which examined more than 27,000 postmenopausal women age 50每79 (mean age, 63) for an average of 5每7 years, was stopped early because of an overall unfavorable risk-benefit ratio in the estrogen-progestin arm and an excess risk of stroke that was not offset by a reduced risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the estrogen-only arm.

The following summary offers a decision-making guide based on a synthesis of currently available evidence. Prevention of cardiovascular disease is eliminated from the equation due to lack of evidence for such benefits in recent randomized clinical trials.

Definite Benefits

Symptoms of Menopause

Compelling evidence, including data from randomized clinical trials, indicates that estrogen therapy is highly effective for controlling vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms. Alternative approaches, including the use of antidepressants (such as venlafaxine, 75每150 mg/d), gabapentin (300每900 mg/d), clonidine (0.1每0.2 mg/d), or vitamin E (400每800 IU/d), or the consumption of soy-based products or other phytoestrogens, may also alleviate vasomotor symptoms, although they are less effective than HT. For genitourinary symptoms, the efficacy of vaginal estrogen is similar to that of oral or transdermal estrogen.

Osteoporosis(See Also Chap. 354)

Bone Density

By reducing bone turnover and resorption rates, estrogen slows the aging-related bone loss experienced by most postmenopausal women. More than 50 randomized trials have demonstrated that postmenopausal estrogen therapy, with or without a progestogen, rapidly increases bone mineral density at the spine by 4每6% and at the hip by 2每3%, and maintains those increases during treatment.

Fractures

Data from observational studies indicate a 50每80% lower risk of vertebral fracture and a 25每30% lower risk of hip, wrist, and other peripheral fractures among current estrogen users; addition of a progestogen does not appear to modify this benefit. In the WHI, 5每7 years of either combined estrogen-progestin or estrogen-only therapy was associated with a 30每40% reduction in hip fracture and 20每30% fewer total fractures among a population unselected for osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates (such as alendronate, 10 mg/d or 70 mg once per week; risedronate, 5 mg/d or 35 mg once per week; or ibandronate, 2.5 mg/d or 150 mg once per month or 3 mg every 3 months IV) and raloxifene (60 mg/d), a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), have been shown in randomized trials to increase bone mass density and decrease fracture rates. A recently available option for treatment of osteoporosis is parathyroid hormone (teriparatide, 20 g/d SC). These agents, unlike estrogen, do not appear to have adverse effects on the endometrium or breast. Increased physical activity and adequate calcium (1000每1200 mg/d through diet or supplements in two to three divided doses) and vitamin D (600每1000 IU/d) intakes may also reduce the risk of osteoporosis-related fractures. (Blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D of 75 nmol/L are optimal for bone-density maintenance and fracture prevention.) The Fracture Risk Assessment (FRAX?) score, an algorithm that combines an individual's bone-density score with age and other risk factors to predict her 10-year risk of hip and major osteoporotic fracture, may be of use in guiding decisions about pharmacologic treatment (see http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/index.htm).

Definite Risks

Endometrial Cancer (with Estrogen Alone)

A combined analysis of 30 observational studies found a tripling of endometrial cancer risk among short-term (1每5 years) users of unopposed estrogen and a nearly tenfold increased risk among users for 10 or more years. These findings are supported by results from the randomized Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions (PEPI) trial, in which 24% of women assigned to unopposed estrogen for 3 years developed atypical endometrial hyperplasia, a premalignant lesion, compared with only 1% of women assigned to placebo. Use of a progestogen, which opposes the effects of estrogen on the endometrium, eliminates these risks.

Venous Thromboembolism

A meta-analysis of 12 studies〞8 case-control, 1 cohort, and 3 randomized trials〞found that current estrogen use was associated with a doubling of venous thromboembolism risk in postmenopausal women. Relative risks of thromboembolic events were even greater (2.7每5.1) in the three trials included in the meta-analysis. Results from the WHI indicate a twofold increase in risk of venous and pulmonary thromboembolism associated with estrogen-progestin and a one-third increase in this risk with estrogen-only therapy. Transdermal estrogen, taken alone or with certain progestogens (micronized progesterone or pregnane derivatives), appears to be a safer alternative with respect to thrombotic risk.

Breast Cancer (with Estrogen-Progestin)

An increased risk of breast cancer has been found among current or recent estrogen users in observational studies; this risk is directly related to duration of use. In a meta-analysis of 51 case-control and cohort studies, short-term use (<5 years) of postmenopausal HT did not appreciably elevate breast cancer incidence, whereas long-term use (5 years) was associated with a 35% increase in risk. In contrast to findings for endometrial cancer, combined estrogen-progestin regimens appear to increase breast cancer risk more than estrogen alone. Data from randomized trials also indicate that estrogen-progestin raises breast cancer risk. In the WHI, women assigned to receive combination hormones for an average of 5.6 years were 24% more likely to develop breast cancer than women assigned to placebo, but 7.1 years of estrogen-only therapy did not increase risk. Indeed, the WHI showed a trend toward a reduction in breast cancer risk with estrogen alone, although it is unclear whether this finding would pertain to formulations of estrogen other than conjugated equine estrogens or to treatment durations longer than 7 years. In the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS), 4 years of combination therapy was associated with a 27% increase in breast cancer risk. Although the latter finding was not statistically significant, the totality of evidence strongly implicates estrogen-progestin therapy in breast carcinogenesis.

Gallbladder Disease

Large observational studies report a two- to threefold increased risk of gallstones or cholecystectomy among postmenopausal women taking oral estrogen. In the WHI, women randomized to estrogen-progestin or estrogen alone had a 67% and 93% greater risk, respectively, of undergoing cholecystectomy than those assigned to placebo. Increased risks were also observed in HERS. Transdermal HT might be a safer alternative, but further research is needed.

Probable or Uncertain Risks and Benefits

Coronary Heart Disease/Stroke

Until recently, HT had been enthusiastically recommended as a possible cardioprotective agent. In the past 3 decades, multiple observational studies suggested, in the aggregate, that estrogen use leads to a 35每50% reduction in CHD incidence among postmenopausal women. The biologic plausibility of such an association is supported by data from randomized trials demonstrating that exogenous estrogen lowers plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and raises high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels by 10每15%. Administration of estrogen also favorably affects lipoprotein(a) levels, LDL oxidation, endothelial vascular function, fibrinogen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. However, estrogen therapy also has unfavorable effects on other biomarkers of cardiovascular risk: it boosts triglyceride levels; promotes coagulation via factor VII, prothrombin fragments 1 and 2, and fibrinopeptide A elevations; and raises levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein.

Randomized trials of estrogen or combined estrogen-progestin in women with preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD) have not confirmed the benefits reported in observational studies. In HERS, a secondary prevention trial designed to test the efficacy and safety of estrogen-progestin therapy on clinical cardiovascular outcomes, the 4-year incidence of coronary mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction was similar in the active treatment and placebo groups, and a 50% increase in risk of coronary events was noted during the first year of the study among participants assigned to the active treatment group. Although it is possible that progestin may mitigate estrogen's benefits, the Estrogen Replacement and Atherosclerosis (ERA) trial indicated that angiographically determined progression of coronary atherosclerosis was unaffected by either opposed or unopposed estrogen treatment. Moreover, the Papworth Hormone Replacement Therapy Atherosclerosis Study, a trial of transdermal estradiol with and without norethindrone; the Women's Estrogen for Stroke Trial (WEST), a trial of oral 17-estradiol; and the EStrogen in the Prevention of ReInfarction Trial (ESPRIT), a trial of oral estradiol valerate, found no cardiovascular benefits of the regimens studied. Thus, in clinical trials, HT has not proved effective for the secondary prevention of CVD in postmenopausal women.

Primary prevention trials also suggest an early increase in cardiovascular risk and absence of cardioprotection with postmenopausal HT. Results from the WHI suggest a deleterious cardiovascular effect of HT. Women assigned to 5.6 years of estrogen-progestin therapy were 24% more likely to develop CHD and 31% more likely to suffer a stroke than those assigned to placebo. In the estrogen-only arm of the WHI, a similar increase in stroke and no effect on CHD were observed.

However, a closer look at available data suggests that timing of initiation of HT may critically influence the association between such therapy and CHD. Estrogen may slow early stages of atherosclerosis but have adverse effects on advanced atherosclerotic lesions. It has been hypothesized that the prothrombotic and proinflammatory effects of estrogen manifest themselves predominantly among women with subclinical lesions who initiate HT well after the menopausal transition, whereas women with less arterial damage who start HT early in menopause may derive cardiovascular benefit because they have not yet developed advanced lesions. Nonhuman primate data support this concept. Conjugated estrogens had no effect on the extent of coronary artery plaque in cynomolgus monkeys assigned to estrogen alone or combined with progestin starting 2 years (approximately 6 human years) after oophorectomy and well after the establishment of atherosclerosis. However, administration of exogenous hormones immediately after oophorectomy, during the early stages of atherosclerosis, reduced the extent of plaque by 70%.

Lending further credence to this hypothesis are results of subgroup analyses of observational and clinical trial data. For example, among women who entered the WHI trial with a better cholesterol profile, estrogen with or without progestin led to a 40% lower risk for incident CHD. Among women who entered with a worse cholesterol profile, therapy resulted in a 73% higher risk (p for interaction=0.02). Moreover, although there was no association between estrogen-only therapy and CHD in the WHI trial cohort as a whole, such therapy was associated with a CHD risk reduction of 37% among participants age 50每59. By contrast, a risk reduction of only 8% was observed among those age 60每69, and a risk increase of 11% was found among those age 70每79. Due to the relatively small number of cases of myocardial infarction or coronary death (the primary definition of CHD in the WHI), especially in the younger women, these intra- and inter-age group differences were not statistically significant. However, when the definition of CHD was widened to include coronary bypass surgery or percutaneous coronary interventions, estrogen-only therapy was associated with a significant 45% reduction in CHD among women in the youngest age group. Moreover, estrogen was associated with lower levels of coronary artery calcified plaque.

Although age did not have a similar effect in the estrogen-progestin arm of the WHI, CHD risks steadily increased with years since menopause. Estrogen-progestin was associated with an 11% risk reduction for women less than 10 years beyond menopause but was associated with a 22% increase in risk for women 10每19 years from menopause, and a 71% increase in risk for women 20 years or more from menopause (only the latter was statistically significant). In the large observational Nurses' Health Study, women who chose to start HT within 4 years of menopause experienced a lower risk of CHD than did nonusers, whereas those who began therapy 10 or more years after menopause appeared to receive little coronary benefit. Because observational studies include a high proportion of women who begin HT within 3每4 years of menopause and clinical trials include a high proportion of women 12 or more years past menopause, these findings help to reconcile some of the apparent discrepancies between the two types of studies.

Whether or not age at initiation of HT influences stroke risk is not well understood. In the WHI and the Nurses' Health Study, HT was associated with an excess risk of stroke in all age groups. Further research is needed on age, time since menopause, and other clinical characteristics as well as on biomarkers that predict increases or decreases in cardiovascular risk associated with exogenous HT. Furthermore, it remains uncertain whether different doses, formulations, or routes of administration of HT will produce different cardiovascular effects.

Colorectal Cancer

Observational studies have suggested that HT reduces risks of colon and rectal cancer, although the estimated magnitudes of the relative benefits ranged from 8 to 34% in various meta-analyses. In the WHI, the sole trial to examine the issue, estrogen-progestin was associated with a significant 44% reduction in colorectal cancer over a 5.6-year period, although no benefit was seen with 7 years of estrogen-only therapy.

Cognitive Decline and Dementia

A meta-analysis of ten case-control and two cohort studies suggested that postmenopausal HT is associated with a 34% decreased risk of dementia. Subsequent randomized trials, including the WHI, however, have failed to demonstrate any benefit of estrogen or estrogen-progestin therapy on the progression of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and/or have indicated a potential adverse effect of HT on the incidence of dementia, at least in women age 65 and older. Determining whether timing of initiation of HT influences cognitive outcomes will require further study.

Ovarian Cancer and Other Disorders

On the basis of limited observational and randomized data, it has been hypothesized that HT increases the risk of ovarian cancer and reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Results from the WHI support these hypotheses. The WHI also found that estrogen-progestin use was associated with increased lung cancer mortality.

Changes in Health Status after Discontinuation of Hormone Therapy

In the WHI cohort as a whole, the elevated risks for CHD, stroke, and venous thromboembolism associated with active use of estrogen-progestin disappeared within 2.4 years after discontinuation of therapy, as did the benefits, including amelioration of hot flashes and protection against osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer. A slightly elevated risk for breast cancer persisted, and a suggestion of higher risks for lung cancer, total cancer, and total mortality emerged. Postintervention results stratified by age or time since menopause onset are not yet available.

Approach to the Patient: Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy

The rational use of postmenopausal HT requires balancing the potential benefits and risks. Figure 348-2 provides one approach to decision making. The clinician should first determine whether the patient has moderate to severe menopausal symptoms, the only indication for initiating systemic HT (urogenital symptoms in the absence of vasomotor symptoms may be treated with vaginal estrogen). The benefits and risks of such therapy should then be reviewed with the patient, giving more emphasis to absolute than to relative measures of effect, and pointing out uncertainties in clinical knowledge where relevant. Because chronic disease rates generally increase with age, absolute risks tend to be greater in older women, even when relative risks remain similar. Potential side effects〞especially vaginal bleeding that may result from use of combined estrogen-progestogen formulations recommended for women with an intact uterus〞should be noted. The patient's own preference regarding therapy should be elicited and factored into the decision. Contraindications to HT should be assessed routinely and include unexplained vaginal bleeding, active liver disease, venous thromboembolism, history of endometrial cancer (except stage 1 without deep invasion) or breast cancer, and history of CHD, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or diabetes. Relative contraindications include hypertriglyceridemia (>400 mg/dl) and active gallbladder disease; in such cases, transdermal estrogen may be an option. Primary prevention of heart disease should not be viewed as an expected benefit of HT, and an increase in stroke and a small early increase in coronary artery disease risk should be considered. Nevertheless, such therapy may be appropriate if the noncoronary benefits of treatment clearly outweigh risks. A woman who suffers an acute coronary event or stroke while on HT should stop therapy immediately.

Short-term use (<5 years) of HT is appropriate for relief of menopausal symptoms among women without contraindications to such use. However, such therapy should be avoided among women with an elevated baseline risk of future cardiovascular events. Women who have contraindications, or are opposed to HT, may derive benefit from the use of certain antidepressants (including venlafaxine, fluoxetine, or paroxetine), gabapentin, clonidine, soy, or black cohosh, and, for genitourinary symptoms, intravaginal estrogen creams or devices.

Long-term use (5 years) of HT, especially estrogen-progestogen, is more problematic because a heightened risk of breast cancer must be factored into the decision. Reasonable candidates for such use include a small percentage of postmenopausal women and comprise those who have persistent severe vasomotor symptoms along with an increased risk of osteoporosis (e.g., those with osteopenia, a personal or family history of nontraumatic fracture, or a weight below 125 lbs), who also have no personal or family history of breast cancer in a first-degree relative or other contraindications, and who have a strong personal preference for therapy. Poor candidates are women with elevated cardiovascular risk, those at increased risk of breast cancer (e.g., women who have a first-degree relative with breast cancer, susceptibility genes such as BRCA1 or BRCA2, or a personal history of cellular atypia detected by breast biopsy), and those at low risk of osteoporosis. Even in reasonable candidates, strategies to minimize dose and duration of use should be employed. For example, women using HT to relieve intense vasomotor symptoms in early postmenopause should consider discontinuing therapy before 5 years, resuming it only if such symptoms persist. Because of the role of progestogens in increasing breast cancer risk, regimens that employ cyclic rather than continuous progestogen exposure should be considered if treatment is extended. For prevention of osteoporosis, alternative therapies such as bisphosphonates or SERMs should be considered. Research on androgen-containing preparations has been limited, particularly in terms of long-term safety. Additional research on the effects of these agents on CVD, glucose tolerance, and breast cancer will be of particular interest.

In addition to HT, control of symptoms and prevention of chronic disease can be accomplished by lifestyle choices, including smoking abstention, adequate physical activity, and a healthy diet. An expanding array of pharmacologic options (e.g., bisphosphonates, SERMs, and other agents for osteoporosis, and cholesterol-lowering or antihypertensive agents for CVD should also reduce the widespread reliance on hormone use. However, short-term HT may still benefit some women.

Disorders of Sex Development: Introduction

Sex development begins in utero but continues into young adulthood with the achievement of sexual maturity and reproductive capability. The major determinants of sex development can be divided into three major components: chromosomal sex, gonadal sex (sex determination), and phenotypic sex (sex differentiation) (Fig. 349-1). Abnormalities at each of these stages can result in disorders of sex development (DSDs) (Table 349-1). A child born with ambiguous genitalia requires urgent assessment, as some causes such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), can be associated with life-threatening adrenal crises. Early gender assignment and clear communication with parents about the diagnosis and treatment options are essential. The involvement of an experienced multidisciplinary team is crucial for counseling, medical management, and surgical evaluation/intervention (if needed). Subtler forms of gonadal dysfunction [e.g., Klinefelter's syndrome (KS), Turner's syndrome (TS)] often are diagnosed later in life by internists. Because these conditions are associated with a variety of psychological, reproductive, and metabolic consequences, an open dialogue must be established between the patient and health care providers to ensure continuity and attention to these issues.

Sex Development

Chromosomal sex describes the X and/or Y chromosome complement (46,XY male; 46,XX female) that is established at the time of fertilization. The presence of a normal Y chromosome determines that testis development will occur even in the presence of multiple X chromosomes (e.g., 47,XXY or 48,XXXY). The loss of an X chromosome impairs gonad development (45,X or 45,X/46,XY mosaicism). Fetuses with no X chromosome (45,Y) are not viable.

Gonadal sex refers to the assignment of gonadal tissue as testis or ovary. The embryonic gonad is bipotential and can develop (from 42 days gestation) into either a testis or an ovary, depending on which genes are expressed (Fig. 349-2). Testis development is initiated by expression of the Y chromosome gene SRY (sex- determining region on the Y chromosome) that encodes an HMG box transcription factor. SRY is expressed transiently in cells destined to become Sertoli cells and serves as a pivotal switch to establish the testis lineage. Mutation of SRY prevents testis development in chromosomal 46,XY males, whereas translocation of SRY in 46,XX females is sufficient to induce testis development and a male phenotype. Other genes are necessary to continue testis development. SOX9 (SRY-related HMG-box gene 9) is upregulated by SRY in the developing male gonad but is suppressed in the female gonad. Transgenic expression of SOX9 is sufficient to initiate testis formation in mice, and mutations that disrupt SOX9 impair testis development. WT1 (Wilms' tumor每related gene 1) acts early in the genetic pathway and regulates the transcription of several genes, including SFI (officially called NRSA1), DAX1 (NR0B1), and AMH (encoding MIS, m邦llerian-inhibiting substance). SF1 encodes steroidogenic factor 1, a nuclear receptor that functions in cooperation with other transcription factors to regulate a large array of adrenal and gonadal genes, including SOX9 and many genes involved in steroidogenesis. Heterozygous SF1 mutations account for 10% of XY patients with gonadal dysgenesis and impaired androgenization, indicating the sensitivity of the testis to SF1 gene dosage. The early expression pattern of SF1 in the gonad parallels that of another orphan nuclear receptor, DAX1 (dosage sensitive sex-reversal, adrenal hypoplasia congenita on the X chromosome, gene 1). Duplication of DAX1 impairs testis development, whereas deletions or mutations of DAX1 lead to disordered formation of testis cords, again revealing the exquisite sensitivity of the male sex-determining pathway to gene dosage effects. In addition to the genes mentioned above, studies of human and murine mutations indicate that at least 15 other genes are also involved in gonadal differentiation, gonadal development, and final positioning of the gonad (Fig. 349-2). These genes encode an array of signaling molecules and paracrine growth factors in addition to transcription factors.

Although ovarian development once was considered a "default" process, it is now clear that specific genes are expressed during the earliest stages of ovary development. Some of these factors may repress testis development (e.g., WNT4, R-spondin-1) (Fig. 349-2). Once the ovary has formed, additional genes are required for normal follicular development [e.g., follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) receptor, GDF9]. Steroidogenesis in the ovary requires the development of follicles that contain granulosa cells and theca cells surrounding the oocytes (Chap. 347). Thus, there is relatively limited ovarian steroidogenesis until gonadotropins are produced at puberty.

Germ cells also develop in a sex dimorphic manner. In the developing ovary, primordial germ cells (PGCs) proliferate and enter meiosis, whereas they proliferate and then undergo mitotic arrest in the developing testis. PGC entry into meiosis is initiated by retinoic acid that activates STRA8 (stimulated by retinoic acid 8) and other genes involved in meiosis. The developing testis produces high levels of CYP26B1, an enzyme that degrades retinoic acid, preventing PGC entry into meiosis. Approximately 7 million germ cells are present in the fetal ovary in the second trimester, and 1 million remain at birth. Only 400 are ovulated during a woman's reproductive life span (Chap. 347).

Phenotypic sex refers to the structures of the external and internal genitalia and secondary sex characteristics. The male phenotype requires the secretion of anti-m邦llerian hormone (AMH, also known as m邦llerian-inhibiting substance, MIS) from Sertoli cells and testosterone from testicular Leydig cells. AMH is a member of the transforming growth factor (TGF)  family and acts through specific receptors to cause regression of the m邦llerian structures (from 60每80 days' gestation). At 60每140 days' gestation, testosterone supports the development of wolffian structures, including the epididymides, vasa deferentia, and seminal vesicles. Testosterone is the precursor for dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent androgen that promotes development of the external genitalia, including the penis and scrotum (65每100 days, and thereafter) (Fig. 349-3). The urogenital sinus develops into the prostate and prostatic urethra in the male and into the urethra and lower portion of the vagina in the female. The genital tubercle becomes the glans penis in the male and the clitoris in the female. The urogenital swellings form the scrotum or the labia majora, and the urethral folds fuse to form the shaft of the penis and the male urethra or the labia minora. In the female, wolffian ducts regress and the m邦llerian ducts form the fallopian tubes, uterus, and upper segment of the vagina. A female phenotype will develop in the absence of the gonad, but estrogen is needed for maturation of the uterus and breast at puberty.

Disorders of Chromosomal Sex

Variations in sex chromosome number and structure can present as disorders of sex development (e.g., 45,X/46,XY). KS (47,XXY) and TS (45,X) do not usually present with genital ambiguity but are associated with gonadal dysfunction (Table 349-2).

Klinefelter's Syndrome (47,XXY)

Pathophysiology

The classic form of KS (47,XXY) occurs after meiotic nondisjunction of the sex chromosomes during gametogenesis (40% during spermatogenesis, 60% during oogenesis) (Chap. 62). Mosaic forms of KS (46,XY/47,XXY) are thought to result from chromosomal mitotic nondisjunction within the zygote and occur in at least 10% of individuals with this condition. Other chromosomal variants of KS (e.g., 48,XXYY, 48,XXXY) have been reported but are less common.

Clinical Features

KS is characterized by small testes, infertility, gynecomastia, "eunuchoid" proportions, and incomplete virilization in phenotypic males. It has an incidence of at least 1 in 1000 men, but approximately 75% of cases are not diagnosed. In severe cases, individuals present prepubertally with small testes or with impaired androgenization and gynecomastia at the time of puberty. Developmental delay and learning disabilities may be a feature. Later in life, eunuchoid features or infertility lead to the diagnosis. Testes are small and firm [median length 2.5 cm (4 mL volume); almost always <3.5 cm (12 mL)] and typically seem inappropriately small for the degree of androgenization. Biopsies are not usually necessary but reveal seminiferous tubule hyalinization and azoospermia. Other clinical features of KS are listed in Table 349-2. Plasma concentrations of FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) are increased in most patients with 47,XXY (90% and 80%, respectively), and plasma testosterone is decreased (50每75%), reflecting primary gonadal failure. Estradiol is often increased because of chronic Leydig cell stimulation by LH and because of aromatization of androstenedione by adipose tissue; the increased ratio of estradiol/testosterone results in gynecomastia. Patients with mosaic forms of KS have less severe clinical features, have larger testes, and sometimes achieve spontaneous fertility.

Treatment: Klinefelter's Syndrome

Gynecomastia should be treated by surgical reduction if it causes concern (Chap. 346). Androgen supplementation improves virilization, libido, energy, hypofibrinolysis, and bone mineralization in underandrogenized men but may occasionally worsen gynecomastia (Chap. 346). Fertility has been achieved by using in vitro fertilization in men with oligospermia or with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) after retrieval of spermatozoa by testicular sperm extraction techniques. In specialized centers, successful spermatozoa retrieval using this technique is possible in >50% of men with nonmosaic KS. After ICSI and embryo transfer, successful pregnancies can be achieved in 50% of these cases. The risk of transmission of this chromosomal abnormality needs to be considered, and preimplantation screening may be desired, although this outcome is much less common than originally predicted.

Turner's Syndrome (Gonadal Dysgenesis; 45,X)

Pathophysiology

Approximately one-half of individuals with Turner's syndrome have a 45,X karyotype, about 20% have 45,X/46,XX mosaicism, and the remainder have structural abnormalities of the X chromosome such as X fragments, isochromosomes, or rings. The clinical features of TS result from haploinsufficiency of multiple X chromosomal genes (e.g., short stature homeobox, SHOX). However, imprinted genes also may be affected when the inherited X has different parental origins.

Clinical Features

TS is characterized by bilateral streak gonads, primary amenorrhea, short stature, and multiple congenital anomalies in phenotypic females. It affects 1 in 2500 women and is diagnosed at different ages depending on the dominant clinical features (Table 349-2). Prenatally, a diagnosis of TS usually is made incidentally after chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis for unrelated reasons such as advanced maternal age. Prenatal ultrasound findings include increased nuchal translucency. The postnatal diagnosis of TS should be considered in female neonates or infants with lymphedema, nuchal folds, low hairline, or left-sided cardiac defects and in girls with unexplained growth failure or pubertal delay. Although limited spontaneous pubertal development occurs in up to 30% of girls with TS (10%, 45,X; 30每40%, 45,X/46,XX) and 2% reach menarche, the vast majority of women with TS develop complete ovarian failure. This diagnosis should be considered, therefore, in all women who present with primary or secondary amenorrhea and elevated gonadotropin levels.

Treatment: Turner's Syndrome

The management of girls and women with TS requires a multidisciplinary approach because of the number of potentially involved organ systems. Detailed cardiac and renal evaluation should be performed at the time of diagnosis. Individuals with congenital heart defects (CHDs) (30%) (bicuspid aortic valve, 30每50%; coarctation of the aorta, 30%; aortic root dilation, 5%) require long-term follow-up by an experienced cardiologist, antibiotic prophylaxis for dental or surgical procedures, and serial imaging of aortic root dimensions, as progressive aortic root dilation is associated with increased risk of aortic dissection. Individuals found to have congenital renal and urinary tract malformations (30%) are at risk for urinary tract infections, hypertension, and nephrocalcinosis. Hypertension can occur independently of cardiac and renal malformations and should be monitored and treated as in other patients with essential hypertension. Clitoral enlargement or other evidence of virilization suggests the presence of covert, translocated Y chromosomal material and is associated with increased risk of gonadoblastoma, apparently as a consequence of Y chromosomal genes distinct from SRY. Regular assessment of thyroid function, weight, dentition, hearing, speech, vision, and educational issues should be performed during childhood. Otitis media and middle-ear disease are prevalent in childhood (50每85%), and sensorineural hearing loss becomes progressively common with age (70每90%). Autoimmune hypothyroidism (15每30%) can occur in childhood but has a mean age of onset in the third decade. Counseling about long-term growth and fertility issues should be provided. Patient support groups are active throughout the world and can play an invaluable role.

The treatment of short stature in children with TS remains a challenge, as untreated final height rarely exceeds 150 cm in nonmosaic 45,X TS. High-dose recombinant growth hormone stimulates growth rate in children with TS and may be used alone or in combination with low doses of the nonaromatizable anabolic steroid oxandrolone (up to 0.05 mg/kg per d) in an older child (>9 years). However, final height increments are often modest (5每10 cm), and individualization of treatment response to regimens may be beneficial. Girls with evidence of gonadal failure require estrogen replacement to induce breast and uterine development, support growth, and maintain bone mineralization. Most physicians now choose to initiate low-dose estrogen therapy (one-tenth to one-eighth of the adult replacement dose) to induce puberty at an age-appropriate time (12 years). Doses of estrogen are increased gradually to allow feminization over a 2每4 year period. Progestins are added later to regulate withdrawal bleeds, and some women with TS have achieved successful pregnancy after ovum donation and in vitro fertilization. Long-term follow-up of women with TS involves careful surveillance of sex hormone replacement and reproductive function, bone mineralization, cardiac function and aortic root dimensions, blood pressure, weight and glucose tolerance, hepatic and lipid profiles, thyroid function, and hearing. This service is provided by a dedicated TS clinic in some centers.

Mixed Gonadal Dysgenesis (45,X/46,Xy)

Mixed gonadal dysgenesis typically results from 45,X/46,XY mosaicism. The phenotype of patients with this condition varies considerably. Although some patients have a predominantly female phenotype with somatic features of TS, streak gonads, and m邦llerian structures, most 45,X/46,XY individuals have a male phenotype and testes, and the diagnosis is made incidentally after amniocentesis or during investigation of infertility. In practice, most children referred for assessment have ambiguous genitalia and variable somatic features. A female sex-of-rearing is often assigned (60%) if uterine structures are present, gonads are intraabdominal, and phallic development is poor. In such situations, gonadectomy usually is undertaken to prevent further androgen secretion and prevent development of gonadoblastoma (up to 25%). Individuals raised as males require reconstructive surgery for hypospadias and removal of dysgenetic gonads if the gonads cannot be brought down into the scrotum. Scrotal testes can be preserved but require regular examination for tumor development. Biopsy for carcinoma in situ is recommended in adolescence, and testosterone supplementation may be required to support androgenization in puberty. Height potential is usually attenuated.

Ovotesticular Dsd

Ovotesticular DSD (formerly called true hermaphroditism) occurs when both an ovary and a testis〞or when an ovotestis〞are found in one individual. For unclear reasons, gonadal asymmetry most often occurs with a testis on the right and an ovary on the left. Most individuals with this diagnosis have a 46,XX karyotype, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. A 46,XX/46,XY chimeric karyotype is less common and has a variable phenotype.
 
Disorders of Gonadal and Phenotypic Sex

The clinical features of patients with disorders of gonadal and phenotypic sex are divided into the underandrogenization of 46,XY males (46,XY DSD) and the excess androgenization of 46,XX females (46,XX DSD) (Table 349-1). These disorders cover a spectrum of phenotypes ranging from "46,XY phenotypic females" or "46,XX males" to individuals with ambiguous genitalia.

46,Xy Dsd (Underandrogenized Males)

Underandrogenization of the 46,XY fetus (formerly called male pseudohermaphroditism) reflects defects in androgen production or action. It can result from disorders of testis development, defects of androgen synthesis, or resistance to testosterone and DHT (Table 349-1).

Disorders of Testis Development

Testicular Dysgenesis

Patients with pure (or complete) gonadal dysgenesis(Swyer syndrome) have streak gonads, m邦llerian structures (due to insufficient AMH/MIS secretion), and a complete absence of androgenization. Serum AMH/MIS is low, and testosterone response to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation is impaired. Patients with partial gonadal dysgenesis(dysgenetic testes) may produce enough MIS to regress the uterus and, sometimes, sufficient testosterone for partial androgenization. Gonadal dysgenesis can result from mutations or deletions of testis-promoting genes (WT1, SF1, SRY, SOX9, DHH, ATRX, ARX, DMRT) or duplication of chromosomal loci containing "antitestis" genes (e.g., WNT4/RSPO1, DAX1) (Table 349-3). Among these, deletions or mutations of SRY and heterozygous mutations of SF1(NR5A1) appear to be most common but still account collectively for <25% of cases. Associated clinical features may be present, reflecting additional functional roles for these genes. For example, renal dysfunction occurs in patients with specific WT1 mutations (Denys-Drash and Fraser's syndromes), primary adrenal failure occurs in some patients with SF1 mutations, and severe cartilage abnormalities (campomelic dysplasia) are the predominant clinical feature of SOX9 mutations. A family history of DSD or premature ovarian insufficiency is important (e.g., SF1/NR5A1). Intraabdominal dysgenetic testes should be removed to prevent malignancy, and estrogens can be used to induce secondary sex characteristics in 46,XY individuals raised as females. Absent (vanishing) testis syndrome (bilateral anorchia) reflects regression of the testis during development. The etiology is unknown, but the absence of m邦llerian structures indicates adequate secretion of AMH in utero. Early testicular regression causes impaired androgenization in utero, and in most cases, androgenization of the external genitalia is either normal or slightly impaired (e.g., small penis, hypospadias). These individuals can be offered testicular prostheses and should receive androgen replacement in adolescence.

Disorders of Androgen Synthesis

Defects in the pathway that regulates androgen synthesis (Fig. 349-4) cause underandrogenization of the male fetus (Table 349-1). M邦llerian regression is unaffected because Sertoli cell function is preserved.

Simplified overview of glucocorticoid and androgen synthesis pathways. Defects in CYP21A2 and CYP11B1 shunt steroid precursors into the androgen pathway and cause androgenization of 46,XX females. Testosterone is synthesized in the testicular Leydig's cells and converted to dihydrotestosterone peripherally. Defects in enzymes involved in androgen synthesis result in underandrogenization of 46,XY males. StAR, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein. [After E Braunwald et al (eds): Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 15th ed. New York, McGraw-Hill, 2001.]
 
 

LH Receptor

Mutations in the LH receptor (LHCGR) cause Leydig's cell hypoplasia and androgen deficiency. Defects of LH receptor synthesis or function preclude hCG stimulation of Leydig's cells in utero, as well as LH stimulation of Leydig's cells late in gestation and during the neonatal period. As a result, testosterone and DHT synthesis are insufficient for normal androgenization of the internal and external genitalia, causing a spectrum of phenotypes that range from complete underandrogenization to micropenis, depending on the severity of the mutation.

Steroidogenic Enzyme Pathways

Mutations in steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and CYP11A1 affect both adrenal and gonadal steroidogenesis (Chap. 342). Affected individuals (46,XY) usually have severe early-onset salt-losing adrenal failure and a female phenotype, although later-onset milder variants have been reported. Defects in 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD3b2) also cause adrenal insufficiency in severe cases, but the accumulation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has a mild androgenizing effect, resulting in ambiguous genitalia or hypospadias. Patients with CAH due to 17-hydroxylase (CYP17)deficiency have variable underandrogenization and develop hypertension and hypokalemia due to the potent salt-retaining effects of corticosterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone. Patients with complete loss of 17-hydroxylase function often present as phenotypic females who fail to enter puberty and are found to have inguinal testes and hypertension in adolescence. Some mutations in CYP17 selectively impair 17,20 lyase activity without altering 17-hydroxylase activity, leading to underandrogenization without mineralocorticoid excess and hypertension. Mutations in P450 oxidoreductase (POR) affect multiple steroidogenic enzymes, leading to impaired androgenization and a biochemical pattern of apparent combined 21-hydroxylase and 17-hydroxylase deficiency, sometimes with skeletal abnormalities (Antley-Bixler craniosynostosis). Defects in 17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3(HSD17b3) and 5a-reductase type 2 (SRD5A2) interfere with the synthesis of testosterone and DHT, respectively. These conditions are characterized by minimal or absent androgenization in utero, but some phallic development can occur during adolescence due to the action of other enzyme isoforms. Individuals with 5-reductase type 2 deficiency have normal wolffian structures and usually do not develop breast tissue. At puberty, the increase in testosterone induces muscle mass and other virilizing features despite DHT deficiency. Some individuals change gender from female to male at puberty. Thus, the management of this disorder is challenging. DHT cream can improve prepubertal phallic growth in patients raised as male. Gonadectomy before adolescence and estrogen replacement at puberty can be considered in individuals raised as females.

Disorders of Androgen Action

Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome

Mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) cause resistance to androgen (testosterone, DHT) action or the androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). AIS is a spectrum of disorders that affects at least 1 in 100,000 46,XY individuals. Because the androgen receptor is X-linked, only 46,XY offspring are affected if the mother is a carrier of a mutation. XY individuals with complete AIS (formerly called testicular feminization syndrome) have a female phenotype, normal breast development (due to aromatization of testosterone), a short vagina but no uterus (because MIS production is normal), scanty pubic and axillary hair, and a female psychosexual orientation. Gonadotropins and testosterone levels can be low, normal, or elevated, depending on the degree of androgen resistance and the contribution of estradiol to feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. AMH/MIS levels in childhood are normal or high. Most patients present with inguinal hernias (containing testes) in childhood or with primary amenorrhea in adulthood. Gonadectomy sometimes is performed, as there is a low risk of malignancy, and estrogen replacement is prescribed. Alternatively, the gonads can be left in situ until breast development is complete. The use of graded dilators in adolescence is usually sufficient to dilate the vagina and permit sexual intercourse.

Partial AIS (Reifenstein's syndrome) results from less severe AR mutations. Patients often present in infancy with perineoscrotal hypospadias and small undescended testes and with gynecomastia at the time of puberty. Those individuals raised as males require hypospadias repair in childhood and breast reduction in adolescence. Supplemental testosterone rarely enhances androgenization significantly, as endogenous testosterone is already increased. More severely underandrogenized patients present with clitoral enlargement and labial fusion and may be raised as females. The surgical and psychosexual management of these patients is complex and requires active involvement of the parents and the patient during the appropriate stages of development. Azoospermia and male-factor infertility also have been described in association with mild loss-of-function mutations in the androgen receptor.

Other Disorders Affecting 46, Xy Males

Persistent m邦llerian duct syndrome is the presence of a uterus in an otherwise normal male. This condition can result from mutations in AMH or its receptor (AMHR2). The uterus may be removed, but damage to the vasa deferentia must be avoided. Isolated hypospadias occurs in 1 in 200 males and is treated by surgical repair. Most cases are idiopathic, although evidence of penoscrotal hypospadias, poor phallic development, and/or bilateral cryptorchidism require investigation for an underlying disorder of sex development (e.g., partial gonadal dysgenesis, mild defect in testosterone action, or even severe forms of 46,XX CAH). Unilateral undescended testes (cryptorchidism) affects more than 3% of boys at birth. Orchidopexy should be considered if the testis has not descended by 6 to 9 months of age. Bilateral cryptorchidism occurs less frequently and should raise suspicion of gonadotropin deficiency or DSD. A small subset of patients with cryptorchidism may have mutations in the insulin-like 3 (INSL3) gene or its receptor LGR8 (also known as GREAT), which mediates normal testicular descent. Ascending testis is being recognized increasingly as a distinct condition for which management is currently unclear. Syndromic associations and intrauterine growth retardation also occur relatively frequently in association with impaired testicular function or target tissue responsiveness, but the underlying etiology of many of these conditions is unknown.

46,XX Dsd (Androgenized Females)

Inappropriate androgenization of females (formerly called female pseudohermaphroditism) occurs when the gonad (ovary) contains androgen-secreting testicular material or after increased androgen exposure, which is usually adrenal in origin (Table 349-1).

46,XX Testicular/Ovotesticular Dsd

Testicular tissue can develop in 46,XX testicular DSD (46,XX males) after translocation of SRY or duplication of SOX9 or defects in RSPO1 (Table 349-4).

Increased Androgen Exposure

21-Hydroxylase Deficiency (Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia)

The classic form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD) is the most common cause of CAH (Chap. 342). It has an incidence between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 15,000 and is the most common cause of androgenization in chromosomal 46,XX females (Table 349-4). Affected individuals are homozygous or compound heterozygous for severe mutations in the enzyme 21-hydroxylase (CYP21A2). This mutation causes a block in adrenal glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid synthesis, increasing 17-hydroxyprogesterone and shunting steroid precursors into the androgen synthesis pathway (Fig. 349-4). Glucocorticoid insufficiency causes a compensatory elevation of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), resulting in adrenal hyperplasia and additional synthesis of steroid precursors proximal to the enzymatic block. Increased androgen synthesis in utero causes androgenization of the female fetus in the first trimester. Ambiguous genitalia are seen at birth, with varying degrees of clitoral enlargement and labial fusion. Excess androgen production causes gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty in males with 21-OHD.

The salt-wasting form of 21-OHD results from severe combined glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiency. A salt-wasting crisis usually manifests between 7 and 21 days of life and is a potentially life-threatening event that requires urgent fluid resuscitation and steroid treatment. Thus, a diagnosis of 21-OHD should be considered in any baby with ambiguous genitalia with bilateral nonpalpable gonads. Males (46,XY) with 21-OHD have no genital abnormalities at birth but are equally susceptible to adrenal insufficiency and salt-losing crises.

Females with the classic simple virilizing form of 21-OHD also present with genital ambiguity. They have impaired cortisol biosynthesis but do not develop salt loss. Patients with nonclassic 21-OHD produce normal amounts of cortisol and aldosterone, but at the expense of producing excess androgens. Hirsutism (60%), oligomenorrhea (50%), and acne (30%) are the most common presenting features. This is one of the most common recessive disorders in humans, with an incidence as high as 1 in 100 to 500 in many populations and 1 in 27 in Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern European origin.

Biochemical features of acute salt-wasting 21-OHD are hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, low cortisol and aldosterone, and elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone, ACTH, and plasma renin activity. Presymptomatic diagnosis of classic 21-OHD is now made by neonatal screening tests for increased 17-hydroxyprogesterone in many centers. In most cases, 17-hydroxyprogesterone is markedly increased. In adults, ACTH stimulation (0.25 mg cosyntropin IV) with assays for 17-hydroxyprogesterone at 0 and 30 min can be useful for detecting nonclassic 21-OHD and heterozygotes (Chap. 342).

Treatment: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia

Acute salt-wasting crises require fluid resuscitation, IV hydrocortisone, and correction of hypoglycemia. Once the patient is stabilized, glucocorticoids must be given to correct the cortisol insufficiency and suppress ACTH stimulation, thereby preventing further virilization, rapid skeletal maturation, and the development of polycystic ovaries. Typically, hydrocortisone (10每15 mg/m2 per day in three divided doses) is used in childhood with a goal of partially suppressing 17-hydroxyprogesterone (100每<1000 ng/dL). The aim of treatment is to use the lowest glucocorticoid dose that adequately suppresses adrenal androgen production without causing signs of glucocorticoid excess such as impaired growth and obesity. Salt-wasting conditions are treated with mineralocorticoid replacement. Infants usually need salt supplements up to the first year of life. Plasma renin activity and electrolytes are used to monitor mineralocorticoid replacement. Some patients with simple virilizing 21-OHD also benefit from mineralocorticoid supplements. Newer therapeutic approaches such as antiandrogens and aromatase inhibitors (to block premature epiphyseal closure) are under evaluation. Parents and patients should be aware of the need for increased doses of steroids during sickness, and patients should carry medic alert systems.

Older adolescents and adults often are treated with prednisolone or with dexamethasone at night to provide more complete ACTH suppression. Steroid doses should be adjusted to individual requirements as overtreatment results in weight gain and hypertension and can affect bone turnover. Androstenedione and testosterone may be useful measurements of long-term control, with less fluctuation than 17-hydroxyprogesterone. Mineralocorticoid requirements often decrease in adulthood, and doses should be reduced to avoid hypertension. In very severe cases, adrenalectomy has been advocated but incurs the risks of surgery and total adrenal insufficiency.

Girls with significant genital androgenization due to classic 21-OHD usually undergo vaginal reconstruction and clitoral reduction (maintaining the glans and nerve supply), but the optimal timing of these procedures is debated, as is the need for the individual to be able to consent. There is a higher threshold for undertaking clitoral surgery in some centers as long-term sensation and ability to achieve orgasm can be affected, but the long-term results of newer techniques are not yet known. If surgery is performed in infancy, surgical revision or regular vaginal dilatation may be needed in adolescence or adulthood, and long-term psychological support and psychosexual counseling may be appropriate. Women with 21-OHD frequently develop polycystic ovaries and have reduced fertility, especially when control is poor. Fecundity is achieved in up to 90% of women, but ovulation induction (or even adrenalectomy) is frequently required. Dexamethasone should be avoided in pregnancy. Men with poorly controlled 21-OHD may develop testicular adrenal rests and are at risk for reduced fertility. Prenatal treatment of 21-OHD by the administration of dexamethasone to mothers is still under evaluation. However, treatment of the mother and child must be started ideally before 6 to 7 weeks; long-term effects of prenatal dexamethasone exposure on fetal development are still under evaluation.

The treatment of other forms of CAH includes mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid replacement for salt-losing conditions (e.g., StAR, CYP11A1, HSD3b2), suppression of ACTH drive with glucocorticoids in disorders associated with hypertension (e.g., CYP17, CYP11B1), and appropriate sex-hormone replacement in adolescence and adulthood, when necessary.

Other Causes

Increased androgen synthesis can also occur in CAH due to defects in POR, 11b-hydroxylase(CYP11B1), and 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD3b2) and with mutations in the genes encoding aromatase (CYP19) and the glucocorticoid receptor. Increased androgen exposure in utero can occur with maternal virilizing tumors and with ingestion of androgenic compounds.

Other Disorders Affecting 46,XX Females

Congenital absence of the vagina occurs in association with m邦llerian agenesis or hypoplasia as part of the Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome (rarely caused by WNT4 mutations). This diagnosis should be considered in otherwise phenotypically normal females with primary amenorrhea. Associated features include renal (agenesis) and cervical spinal abnormalities.

Global Considerations

The approach to a child or adolescent with ambiguous genitalia or another DSD requires cultural sensitivity, as the concepts of sex and gender vary widely. Rare genetic DSDs can occur more frequently in specific populations (e.g., 5-reductase type 2 in the Dominican Republic). Different forms of CAH also show ethnic and geographic variability. In many countries, appropriate biochemical tests may not be readily available, and access to appropriate forms of surgery or treatment may be limited.

 Chapter 350. Endocrine Tumors of the Gastrointestinal Tract and Pancreas >
 

General Features of Gastrointestinal (GI) Neuroendocrine Tumors

Gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are tumors derived from the diffuse neuroendocrine system of the GI tract; that system is composed of amine- and acid-producing cells with different hormonal profiles, depending on the site of origin. The tumors historically are divided into carcinoid tumors and pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs), although recent pathologic classifications have proposed that they all be classified as gastrointestinal NETs. In this chapter the term carcinoid tumor is retained because it is widely used. These tumors originally were classified as APUDomas (for amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation), as were pheochromocytomas, melanomas, and medullary thyroid carcinomas, because they share certain cytochemical features as well as various pathologic, biologic, and molecular features (Table 350-1). It was originally proposed that APUDomas had a similar embryonic origin from neural crest cells, but it is now known the peptide-secreting cells are not of neuroectodermal origin. Nevertheless, the concept of APUDomas is useful because the tumors from the cells have important similarities as well as some differences (Table 350-1). In this section, the areas of similarity between PETs and carcinoids will be discussed together and areas in which there are important differences will be discussed separately.

Table 350-1 General Characteristics of Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors [Carcinoids, Pancreatic Endocrine Tumors (Pets)]

 
 
A. Share general neuroendocrine cell markers (identification used for diagnosis)

    1. Chromogranins (A, B, C) are acidic monomeric soluble proteins found in the large secretory granules. Chromogranin A is the most widely used.

    2. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) is the - dimer of the enzyme enolase and is a cytosolic marker of neuroendocrine differentiation.

    3. Synaptophysin is an integral membrane glycoprotein of 38,000 molecular weight found in small vesicles of neurons and neuroendocrine tumors.
 
B. Pathologic similarities

    1. All are APUDomas showing amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation.

    2. Ultrastructurally they have dense-core secretory granules (>80 nm).

    3. Histologically, generally appear similar with few mitoses and uniform nuclei.

    4. Frequently synthesize multiple peptides/amines, which can be detected immunocytochemically but may not be secreted.

    5. Presence or absence of clinical syndrome or type cannot be predicted by immunocytochemical studies.

    6. Histologic classifications increasingly predictive of biologic behavior. Only invasion or metastases establish malignancy
 
C. Similarities of biologic behavior

    1. Generally slow growing, but a proportion are aggressive.

    2. Secrete biologically active peptides/amines, which can cause clinical symptoms.

    3. Generally have high densities of somatostatin receptors, which are used for both localization and treatment.
 
D. Similarities/differences in molecular abnormalities

    1. Similarities

        a. Uncommon〞alterations in common oncogenes (ras, jun, fos, etc).

        b. Uncommon〞alterations in common tumor-suppressor genes (p53, retinoblastoma).

        c. Alterations at MEN 1 locus (11q13) and p16INK4a (9p21) occur in a proportion (10每45%).

        d. Methylation of various genes occurs in 40每87% (ras-associated domain family I, p14, p16, O6 methyl guanosine methyltransferases, retinoic acid receptor )
 
    2. Differences

        a. PETs〞loss of 1p (21%), 3p (8每47%), 3q (8每41%), 11q (21每62%), 6q (18每68%). Gains at 17q (10每55%), 7q (16每68%), 4q (33%).

        b. Carcinoids〞loss of 18q (38每67%) >18p (33每43%) > 9p, 16q21(21每23%). Gains at 17q, 19p (57%), 4q (33%), 14q (20%).

Classification/Pathology/Tumor Biology of Nets

NETs generally are composed of monotonous sheets of small round cells with uniform nuclei, and mitoses are uncommon. They can be identified tentatively on routine histology; however, these tumors are now recognized principally by their histologic staining patterns due to shared cellular proteins. Historically, silver staining was used, and tumors were classified as showing an argentaffin reaction if they took up and reduced silver or as being argyrophilic if they did not reduce it. More recently immunocytochemical localization of chromogranins (A, B, C), neuron-specific enolase, and synaptophysin, which are all neuroendocrine cell markers, is used (Table 350-1). Chromogranin A is currently the most widely used.

Ultrastructurally, these tumors possess electron-dense neurosecretory granules and frequently contain small clear vesicles that correspond to synaptic vesicles of neurons. NETs synthesize numerous peptides, growth factors, and bioactive amines that may be ectopically secreted, giving rise to a specific clinical syndrome (Table 350-2). The diagnosis of the specific syndrome requires the clinical features of the disease (Table 350-2) and cannot be made from the immunocytochemistry results alone. The presence or absence of a specific clinical syndrome also cannot be predicted from the immunocytochemistry alone (Table 350-1). Furthermore, pathologists cannot distinguish between benign and malignant NETs unless metastases or invasion is present.

Carcinoid tumors frequently are classified according to their anatomic area of origin (i.e., foregut, midgut, hindgut) because tumors with similar areas of origin share functional manifestations, histochemistry, and secretory products (Table 350-3). Foregut tumors generally have a low serotonin (5-HT) content; are argentaffin-negative but argyrophilic; occasionally secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), causing an atypical carcinoid syndrome (Fig. 350-1); are often multihormonal; and may metastasize to bone. They uncommonly produce a clinical syndrome due to the secreted products. Midgut carcinoids are argentaffin-positive, have a high serotonin content, most frequently cause the typical carcinoid syndrome when they metastasize (Table 350-3, Fig. 350-1), release serotonin and tachykinins (substance P, neuropeptide K, substance K), rarely secrete 5-HTP or ACTH, and less commonly metastasize to bone. Hindgut carcinoids (rectum, transverse and descending colon) are argentaffin-negative, are often argyrophilic, rarely contain serotonin or cause the carcinoid syndrome (Fig. 350-1, Table 350-3), rarely secrete 5-HTP or ACTH, contain numerous peptides, and may metastasize to bone.

Pancreatic endocrine tumors can be classified into nine well-established specific functional syndromes (Table 350-2), five possible specific functional syndromes (PETs secreting calcitonin, renin, luteinizing hormone, erythropoietin, or insulin-like growth factor II) (Table 350-2), and nonfunctional PETs (pancreatic polypeptide-secreting tumors; PPomas). Other functional hormonal syndromes due to nonpancreatic tumors (usually intraabdominal in location) have been described only rarely and are not included in Table 350-2. They include secretion of glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) that causes intestinal villus hypertrophy (enteroglucagonomas), secretion of GLP-1 that causes hypoglycemia and delayed transit, and intestinal and ovarian tumors secreting peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) that result in altered motility and constipation. Each of the functional syndromes listed in Table 350-2 is associated with symptoms due to the specific hormone released. In contrast, nonfunctional PETs release no products that cause a specific clinical syndrome. "Nonfunctional" is a misnomer in the strict sense because those tumors frequently ectopically secrete a number of peptides [pancreatic polypeptide (PP), chromogranin A, ghrelin, neurotensin,  subunits of human chorionic gonadotropin, neuron-specific enolase]; however, they cause no specific clinical syndrome. The symptoms caused by nonfunctional PETs are entirely due to the tumor per se.

Carcinoid tumors can occur in almost any GI tissue (Table 350-3); however, at present most (70%) have their origin in one of three sites: bronchus, jejunoileum, or colon/rectum. In the past, carcinoid tumors most frequently were reported in the appendix (i.e., 40%); however, the bronchus/lung, rectum, and small intestine are now the most common sites. Overall, the GI tract is the most common site for these tumors, accounting for 64%, with the respiratory tract a distant second at 28%. Both race and sex can affect the frequency as well as the distribution of carcinoid tumors. African Americans have a high incidence of carcinoids, and rectal carcinoids are the most common. Females have a lower incidence of small-intestinal and pancreatic carcinoids.

The term pancreatic endocrine tumor, although widely used and therefore retained here, is also a misnomer, strictly speaking, because these tumors can occur either almost entirely in the pancreas (insulinomas, glucagonomas, nonfunctional PETs, PETs causing hypercalcemia) or at both pancreatic and extrapancreatic sites [gastrinomas, VIPomas (vasoactive intestinal peptide), somatostatinomas, GRFomas (growth hormone每releasing factor)]. PETs are also called islet cell tumors; however, the use of this term is discouraged because it is not established that they originate from the islets and many can occur at extrapancreatic sites.

A number of new classification systems have been proposed for both carcinoids and PETs. In the World Health Organization (WHO) classification it has been proposed that these tumors all be classified as GI neuroendocrine tumors (including carcinoids and PETs), which divides them into three general categories: (1a) well-differentiated NETs, (1b) well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas that have low-grade malignancy, and (2) poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas that are usually small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas of high-grade malignancy. The term carcinoid is synonymous with well-differentiated NETs (1a). This classification is further divided on the basis of tumor location and biology. In addition, for the first time a standard TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification and grading system has been proposed for GI neuroendocrine tumors. The new WHO classification and the TNM classification and grading system were proposed to facilitate the comparison and evaluation of clinical, pathologic, and prognostic features and results of treatment in GI NETs from different studies. These classification systems may provide important prognostic information that can guide treatment (Table 350-4).

The exact incidence of carcinoid tumors or PETs varies according to whether only symptomatic tumors or all tumors are considered. The incidence of clinically significant carcinoids is 7每13 cases/million population per year, whereas any malignant carcinoids at autopsy are reported in 21每84 cases/million population per year. The incidence of GI NETs is approximately 25每50 cases per million in the United States, which makes them less common than adenocarcinomas of the GI tract. However, their incidence has increased sixfold in the last 30 years. Clinically significant PETs have a prevalence of 10 cases/million population, with insulinomas, gastrinomas, and nonfunctional PETs having an incidence of 0.5每2 cases/million population per year (Table 350-2). VIPomas are two to eight times less common, glucagonomas are 17 to 30 times less common, and somatostatinomas are the least common. In autopsy studies 0.5每1.5% of all cases have a PET; however, in less than 1 in 1000 cases was a functional tumor thought to occur.

Both carcinoid tumors and PETs commonly show malignant behavior (Tables 350-2 and 350-3). With PETs, except for insulinomas in which <10% are malignant, 50每100% in different series are malignant. With carcinoid tumors the percentage showing malignant behavior varies in different locations. For the three most common sites of occurrence, the incidence of metastases varies greatly from jejunoileum (58%) > lung/bronchus (6%) > rectum (4%) (Table 350-3). With both carcinoid tumors and PETs, a number of factors, summarized in Table 350-4, are important prognostic factors in determining survival and the aggressiveness of the tumor. Patients with PETs (excluding insulinomas) generally have a poorer prognosis than do patients with GI NETs (carcinoids). The presence of liver metastases is the single most important prognostic factor in single and multivariate analyses for both carcinoid tumors and PETs. Particularly important in the development of liver metastases is the size of the primary tumor. For example, with small-intestinal carcinoids, which are the most common cause of the carcinoid syndrome due to metastatic disease in the liver (Table 350-2), metastases occur in 15每25% if the tumor diameter is <1 cm, 58每80% if it is 1每2 cm in diameter, and >75% if it is >2 cm in diameter. Similar data exist for gastrinomas and other PETs in which the size of the primary tumor is an independent predictor of the development of liver metastases. The presence of lymph node metastases; the depth of invasion; the rapid rate of growth; various histologic features [differentiation, mitotic rates, growth indices, vessel density, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and CD10 metalloproteinase expression]; necrosis; presence of cytokeratin; elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels; older age; advanced stages in WHO, TNM, or grading classification systems; and flow cytometric results such as the presence of aneuploidy are all important prognostic factors for the development of metastatic disease (Table 350-4). For patients with carcinoid tumors, additional associations with a worse prognosis include the development of the carcinoid syndrome (especially the development of carcinoid heart disease), male sex, the presence of a symptomatic tumor or greater increases in a number of tumor markers [5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA), neuropeptide K, chromogranin A], and the presence of various molecular features. With PETs or gastrinomas, which have been the best studied PET long-term, a worse prognosis is associated with female sex, overexpression of the Ha-ras oncogene or p53, the absence of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1), higher levels of various tumor markers (i.e., chromogranin A, gastrin), and various molecular features (Table 350-4).

A number of diseases due to various genetic disorders are associated with an increased incidence of neuroendocrine tumors (Table 350-5). Each one is caused by a loss of a possible tumor-suppressor gene. The most important is MEN 1, which is an autosomal dominant disorder due to a defect in a 10-exon gene on 11q13, which encodes for a 610-amino-acid nuclear protein, menin (Chap. 351). Patients with MEN 1 develop hyperparathyroidism due to parathyroid hyperplasia in 95每100% of cases, PETs in 80每100%, pituitary adenomas in 54每80%, adrenal adenomas in 27每36%, bronchial carcinoids in 8%, thymic carcinoids in 8%, gastric carcinoids in 13每30% of patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, skin tumors [angiofibromas (88%), collagenomas (72%)], central nervous system (CNS) tumors [meningiomas (<8%)], and smooth-muscle tumors [leiomyomas, leiomyosarcomas (1每7%)]. Among patients with MEN 1, 80每100% develop nonfunctional PETs (most are microscopic with 0每13% large/symptomatic), functional PETs occur in 20每80% in different series with a mean of 54% developing Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, 18% insulinomas, 3% glucagonomas, 3% VIPomas, and <1% GRFomas or somatostatinomas. MEN 1 is present in 20每25% of all patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, 4% of patients with insulinomas, and a low percentage (<5%) of patients with the other PETs.

Three phacomatoses associated with neuroendocrine tumors are von Hippel每Lindau disease (VHL), von Recklinghausen's disease [neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1)], and tuberous sclerosis (Bourneville's disease) (Table 350-5). VHL is an autosomal dominant disorder due to defects on chromosome 3p25, which encodes for a 213-amino-acid protein that interacts with the elongin family of proteins as a transcriptional regulator (Chaps. 284, 343, 351, 379). In addition to cerebellar hemangioblastomas, renal cancer, and pheochromocytomas, 10每17% develop a PET. Most are nonfunctional, although insulinomas and VIPomas have been reported. Patients with NF-1 (von Recklinghausen's disease) have defects in a gene on chromosome 17q11.2 that encodes for a 2845-amino-acid protein, neurofibromin, which functions in normal cells as a suppressor of the ras signaling cascade (Chap. 379). Up to 10% of these patients develop an upper GI carcinoid tumor, characteristically in the periampullary region (54%). Many are classified as somatostatinomas because they contain somatostatin immunocytochemically; however, they uncommonly secrete somatostatin and rarely produce a clinical somatostatinoma syndrome. NF-1 has rarely been associated with insulinomas and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. NF-1 accounts for 48% of all duodenal somatostastinomas and 23% of all ampullary carcinoid tumors. Tuberous sclerosis is caused by mutations that alter either the 1164-amino-acid protein hamartin (TSC1) or the 1807-amino-acid protein tuberin (TSC2) (Chap. 379). Both hamartin and tuberin interact in a pathway related to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases and mTor signaling cascades. A few cases including nonfunctional and functional PETs (insulinomas and gastrinomas) have been reported in these patients (Table 350-5).

In contrast to most common nonendocrine tumors, such as carcinoma of the breast, colon, lung, or stomach, in neither PETs nor carcinoid tumors have alterations in common oncogenes (ras, myc, fos, src, jun) or common tumor-suppressor genes (p53, retinoblastoma susceptibility gene) been found to be generally important in their molecular pathogenesis (Table 350-1). Alterations that may be important in their pathogenesis include changes in the MEN 1 gene, p16/MTS1 tumor-suppressor gene, and DPC 4/Smad 4 gene; amplification of the HER-2/neu protooncogene; alterations in transcription factors [Hoxc6 (GI carcinoids)], growth factors, and their receptor expression; methylation of a number of genes that probably results in their inactivation; and deletions of unknown tumor-suppressor genes as well as gains in other unknown genes (Table 350-1). Comparative genomic hybridization, genome-wide allelotyping studies, and genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses have shown that chromosomal losses and gains are common in PETs and carcinoids, but they differ between these two NETs and some have prognostic significance (Table 350-4). Mutations in the MEN 1 gene are probably particularly important. There is loss of heterozygosity at the MEN 1 locus on chromosome 11q13 in 93% of sporadic PETs (i.e., in patients without MEN 1) and in 26每75% of sporadic carcinoid tumors. Mutations in the MEN 1 gene are reported in 31每34% of sporadic gastrinomas. The presence of a number of these molecular alterations (PET or carcinoid) correlates with tumor growth, tumor size, and disease extent or invasiveness and may have prognostic significance.
 
Carcinoid Tumors and Carcinoid Syndrome

Characteristics of the Most Common GI Carcinoid Tumors

Appendiceal Carcinoids

Appendiceal carcinoids occur in 1 in every 200每300 appendectomies, usually in the appendiceal tip. Most (i.e., >90%) are <1 cm in diameter without metastases in older studies, but more recently 2每35% have had metastases (Table 350-3). In the SEER data of 1570 appendiceal carcinoids, 62% were localized, 27% had regional metastases, and 8% had distant metastases. Approximately 50% between 1 and 2 cm metastasized to lymph nodes. Their percentage of the total number of carcinoids decreased from 43.9% (1950每1969) to 2.4% (1992每1999).

Small-Intestinal Carcinoids

Small-intestinal carcinoids account for approximately one-third of all small-bowel tumors in various surgical series. These are frequently multiple; 70每80% are present in the ileum, and 70% within 6 cm (24 in.) of the ileocecal valve. Forty percent are <1 cm in diameter, 32% are 1每2 cm, and 29% are >2 cm. Between 35 and 70% are associated with metastases (Table 350-3). They characteristically cause a marked fibrotic reaction, which can lead to intestinal obstruction. Distant metastases occur to liver in 36每60%, to bone in 3%, and to lung in 4%. As discussed previously, tumor size is an important variable in the frequency of metastases. However, even a proportion of small carcinoid tumors of the small intestine (<1 cm) have metastases in 15每25% of cases, whereas the proportion increases to 58每100% for tumors 1每2 cm in diameter. Carcinoids also occur in the duodenum, with 31% having metastases. No duodenal tumor <1 cm in two series metastasized, whereas 33% of those >2 cm had metastases. Small-intestinal carcinoids are the most common cause (60每87%) of the carcinoid syndrome and are discussed in a later section (Table 350-6).

Rectal Carcinoids

Rectal carcinoids represent 1每2% of all rectal tumors. They are found in approximately 1 in every 2500 proctoscopies. Nearly all occur between 4 and 13 cm above the dentate line. Most are small, with 66每80% being <1 cm in diameter, and rarely metastasize (5%). Tumors between 1 and 2 cm can metastasize in 5每30%, and those >2 cm, which are uncommon, in >70%.

Bronchial Carcinoids

Bronchial carcinoids account for 1每2% of primary lung tumors. The frequency of bronchial carcinoids has increased more than fivefold over the last 30 years. A number of different classifications of bronchial carcinoid tumors have been proposed. In some studies, lung NETs are classified into four categories: typical carcinoid [also called bronchial carcinoid tumor, Kulchitsky cell carcinoma I (KCC-I)], atypical carcinoid [also called well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (KC-II)], intermediate small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, and small cell neuroendocarcinoma (KC-III). Another proposed classification includes three categories of lung NETs: benign or low-grade malignant (typical carcinoid), low-grade malignant (atypical carcinoid), and high-grade malignant (poorly differentiated carcinoma of the large cell or small cell type). The WHO classification includes four general categories: typical carcinoid, atypical carcinoid, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma. These different categories of lung NETs have different prognoses, varying from excellent for typical carcinoid to poor for small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas. The occurrence of large cell and small cell lung carcinoids, but not typical or atypical lung carcinoids, is related to tobacco use.

Gastric Carcinoids

Gastric carcinoids account for 3 of every 1000 gastric neoplasms. Three different subtypes of gastric carcinoids are proposed to occur. Each originates from gastric enterochromaffin-like cells (ECL cells), one of the six types of gastric neuroendocrine cells, in the gastric mucosa. Two subtypes are associated with hypergastrinemic states, either chronic atrophic gastritis (type I) (80% of all gastric carcinoids) or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which is almost always a part of the MEN 1 syndrome (type II) (6% of all cases). These tumors generally pursue a benign course, with type 1 uncommonly (<10%) associated with metastases, whereas type II tumors are slightly more aggressive with 10每30% percentage associated with metastases. They are usually multiple and small and infiltrate only to the submucosa. The third subtype of gastric carcinoid (type III) (sporadic) occurs without hypergastrinemia (14每25% of all gastric carcinoids) and has an aggressive course, with 54每66% developing metastases. Sporadic carcinoids are usually single, large tumors; 50% have atypical histology, and they can be a cause of the carcinoid syndrome. Gastric carcinoids as a percentage of all carcinoids are increasing in frequency [1.96% (1969每1971), 3.6% (1973每1991), 5.8% (1991每1999)].

Carcinoid Tumors Without the Carcinoid Syndrome

The age of patients at diagnosis ranges from 10 to 93 years, with a mean age of 63 years for the small intestine and 66 years for the rectum. The presentation is diverse and is related to the site of origin and the extent of malignant spread. In the appendix, carcinoid tumors usually are found incidentally during surgery for suspected appendicitis. Small-intestinal carcinoids in the jejunoileum present with periodic abdominal pain (51%), intestinal obstruction with ileus/invagination (31%), an abdominal tumor (17%), or GI bleeding (11%). Because of the vagueness of the symptoms, the diagnosis usually is delayed approximately 2 years from onset of the symptoms, with a range up to 20 years. Duodenal, gastric, and rectal carcinoids are most frequently found by chance at endoscopy. The most common symptoms of rectal carcinoids are melena/bleeding (39%), constipation (17%), and diarrhea (12%). Bronchial carcinoids frequently are discovered as a lesion on a chest radiograph, and 31% of the patients are asymptomatic. Thymic carcinoids present as anterior mediastinal masses, usually on chest radiograph or CT scan. Ovarian and testicular carcinoids usually present as masses discovered on physical examination or ultrasound. Metastatic carcinoid tumor in the liver frequently presents as hepatomegaly in a patient who may have minimal symptoms and nearly normal liver function test results.

Carcinoid Tumors with Systemic Symptoms Due to Secreted Products

Carcinoid tumors immunocytochemically can contain numerous GI peptides: gastrin, insulin, somatostatin, motilin, neurotensin, tachykinins (substance K, substance P, neuropeptide K), glucagon, gastrin-releasing peptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), pancreatic polypeptide (PP), ghrelin, other biologically active peptides (ACTH, calcitonin, growth hormone), prostaglandins, and bioactive amines (serotonin). These substances may or may not be released in sufficient amounts to cause symptoms. In various studies of patients with carcinoid tumors, elevated serum levels of PP were found in 43%, motilin in 14%, gastrin in 15%, and VIP in 6%. Foregut carcinoids are more likely to produce various GI peptides than are midgut carcinoids. Ectopic ACTH production causing Cushing's syndrome is seen increasingly with foregut carcinoids (respiratory tract primarily) and in some series has been the most common cause of the ectopic ACTH syndrome, accounting for 64% of all cases. Acromegaly due to growth hormone每releasing factor release occurs with foregut carcinoids, as does the somatostatinoma syndrome, but rarely occurs with duodenal carcinoids. The most common systemic syndrome with carcinoid tumors is the carcinoid syndrome, which is discussed in detail in the next section.

Carcinoid Syndrome

Clinical Features

The cardinal features from a number of series at presentation as well as during the disease course are shown in Table 350-6. Flushing and diarrhea are the two most common symptoms, occurring in up to 73% initially and in up to 89% during the course of the disease. The characteristic flush is of sudden onset; it is a deep red or violaceous erythema of the upper body, especially the neck and face, often associated with a feeling of warmth and occasionally associated with pruritus, lacrimation, diarrhea, or facial edema. Flushes may be precipitated by stress; alcohol; exercise; certain foods, such as cheese; or certain agents, such as catecholamines, pentagastrin, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Flushing episodes may be brief, lasting 2 to 5 min, especially initially, or may last hours, especially later in the disease course. Flushing usually is associated with metastastic midgut carcinoids but can also occur with foregut carcinoids. With bronchial carcinoids the flushes frequently are prolonged for hours to days, reddish in color, and associated with salivation, lacrimation, diaphoresis, diarrhea, and hypotension. The flush associated with gastric carcinoids can also be reddish in color, but with a patchy distribution over the face and neck, although the classic flush seen with midgut carcinoids can also be seen with gastric carcinoids. It may be provoked by food and have accompanying pruritus.

Diarrhea is present in 32每73% initially and 68每84% at some time in the disease course. Diarrhea usually occurs with flushing (85% of cases). The diarrhea usually is described as watery, with 60% of patients having <1 L/d of diarrhea. Steatorrhea is present in 67%, and in 46% it is greater than 15 g/d (normal <7 g). Abdominal pain may be present with the diarrhea or independently in 10每34% of cases.

Cardiac manifestations occur in 11每20% initially of patients with carcinoid syndrome and in 17每56% (mean 40%) at some time in the disease course. The cardiac disease is due to the formation of fibrotic plaques (composed of smooth-muscle cells, myofibroblasts, and elastic tissue) involving the endocardium, primarily on the right side, although lesions on the left side also occur occasionally, especially if a patent foramen ovale exists. The dense fibrous deposits are most commonly on the ventricular aspect of the tricuspid valve and less commonly on the pulmonary valve cusps. They can result in constriction of the valves, and pulmonic stenosis is usually predominant, whereas the tricuspid valve is often fixed open, resulting in regurgitation predominating. Overall, in patients with carcinoid heart disease, 97% have tricuspid insufficiency, 59% tricuspid stenosis, 50% pulmonary insufficiency, 25% pulmonary stenosis, and 11% (0每25%) left-side lesions. Up to 80% of patients with cardiac lesions develop heart failure. Lesions on the left side are much less extensive, occur in 30% at autopsy, and most frequently affect the mitral valve.

Other clinical manifestations include wheezing or asthma-like symptoms (8每18%) and pellagra-like skin lesions (2每25%). A variety of noncardiac problems due to increased fibrous tissue have been reported, including retroperitoneal fibrosis causing urethral obstruction, Peyronie's disease of the penis, intraabdominal fibrosis, and occlusion of the mesenteric arteries or veins.

Pathobiology

Carcinoid syndrome occurred in 8% of 8876 patients with carcinoid tumors, with a rate of 1.4每18.4% in different studies. It occurs only when sufficient concentrations of products secreted by the tumor reach the systemic circulation. In 91% of cases this occurs after distant metastases to the liver. Rarely, primary gut carcinoids with nodal metastases with extensive retroperitoneal invasion, pancreatic carcinoids with retroperitoneal lymph nodes, or carcinoids of the lung or ovary with direct access to the systemic circulation can cause the carcinoid syndrome without hepatic metastases. All carcinoid tumors do not have the same propensity to metastasize and cause the carcinoid syndrome (Table 350-3). Midgut carcinoids account for 60每67% of cases of carcinoid syndrome, foregut tumors for 2每33%, hindgut for 1每8%, and an unknown primary location for 2每15%.

One of the main secretory products of carcinoid tumors involved in the carcinoid syndrome is serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] (Fig. 350-1), which is synthesized from tryptophan. Up to 50% of dietary tryptophan can be used in this synthetic pathway by tumor cells, and this can result in inadequate supplies for conversion to niacin; hence, some patients (2.5%) develop pellagra-like lesions. Serotonin has numerous biologic effects, including stimulating intestinal secretion with inhibition of absorption, stimulating increases in intestinal motility, and stimulating fibrogenesis. In various studies 56每88% of all carcinoid tumors were associated with serotonin overproduction; however, 12每26% of the patients did not have the carcinoid syndrome. In one study platelet serotonin was elevated in 96% of patients with midgut carcinoids, 43% with foregut tumors, and 0% with hindgut tumors. In 90每100% of patients with the carcinoid syndrome there is evidence of serotonin overproduction. Serotonin is thought to be predominantly responsible for the diarrhea because of its effects on gut motility and intestinal secretion, primarily through 5-HT3 and, to a lesser degree, 5-HT4 receptors. Serotonin receptor antagonists (especially 5-HT3 antagonists) relieve the diarrhea in many, but not all, patients. Additional studies suggest that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and tachykinins may be important mediators of the diarrhea in some patients. In one study, plasma tachykinin levels correlated with symptoms of both flushing and diarrhea. Serotonin does not appear to be involved in the flushing because serotonin receptor antagonists do not relieve flushing. In patients with gastric carcinoids the characteristic red, patchy pruritic flush probably is due to histamine release because H1 and H2 receptor antagonists can prevent it. Numerous studies have shown that tachykinins are stored in carcinoid tumors and released during flushing. However, some studies have demonstrated that octreotide can relieve the flushing induced by pentagastrin in these patients without altering the stimulated increase in plasma substance P, suggesting that other mediators must be involved in the flushing. A correlation between plasma tachykinin levels, but not substance P levels, and flushing has been reported. Both histamine and serotonin may be responsible for the wheezing as well as the fibrotic reactions involving the heart, causing Peyronie's disease and intraabdominal fibrosis. The exact mechanism of the heart disease has remained unclear, although increasing evidence supports a central role for serotonin. The valvular heart disease caused by the appetite-suppressant drug dexfenfluramine is histologically indistinguishable from that observed in carcinoid disease. Furthermore, ergot-containing dopamine receptor agonists used for Parkinson's disease (pergolide, cabergoline) cause valvular heart disease that closely resembles that seen in the carcinoid syndrome. Metabolites of fenfluramine, as well as the dopamine receptor agonists, have high affinity for serotonin receptor subtype 5-HT2B receptors, whose activation is known to cause fibroblast mitogenesis. Serotonin receptor subtypes 5-HT1B,1D,2A,2B normally are expressed in human heart valve interstitial cells. High levels of 5-HT2B receptors are known to occur in heart valves and occur in cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes. Studies of cultured interstitial cells from human cardiac valves have demonstrated that these valvulopathic drugs induce mitogenesis by activating 5-HT2B receptors and stimulating upregulation of transforming growth factor  and collagen biosynthesis. These observations support the conclusion that serotonin overproduction by carcinoid tumors is important in mediating the valvular changes, possibly by activating 5-HT2B receptors in the endocardium. Both the magnitude of serotonin overproduction and prior chemotherapy are important predictors of progression of the heart disease. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) overproduction also has been reported in patients with cardiac disease, but its role in the pathogenesis is unknown. However, high plasma levels of ANP have a worse prognosis. Plasma connective tissue growth factor levels are elevated in many fibrotic conditions; elevated levels occur in patients with carcinoid heart disease and correlate with the presence of right-ventricular dysfunction and the extent of valvular regurgitation in patients with carcinoid tumors.

Synthesis, secretion, and metabolism of serotonin (5-HT) in patients with typical and atypical carcinoid syndromes. 5-HIAA, 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid.
 
 

Patients may develop either a typical or, rarely, an atypical carcinoid syndrome. In patients with the typical form, which characteristically is caused by a midgut carcinoid tumor, the conversion of tryptophan to 5-HTP is the rate-limiting step (Fig. 350-1). Once 5-HTP is formed, it is rapidly converted to 5-HT and stored in secretory granules of the tumor or in platelets. A small amount remains in plasma and is converted to 5-HIAA, which appears in large amounts in the urine. These patients have an expanded serotonin pool size, increased blood and platelet serotonin, and increased urinary 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA). Some carcinoid tumors cause an atypical carcinoid syndrome that is thought to be due to a deficiency in the enzyme dopa decarboxylase; thus, 5-HTP cannot be converted to 5-HT (serotonin), and 5-HTP is secreted into the bloodstream (Fig. 350-1). In these patients, plasma serotonin levels are normal but urinary levels may be increased because some 5-HTP is converted to 5-HT in the kidney. Characteristically, urinary 5-HTP and 5-HT are increased, but urinary 5-HIAA levels are only slightly elevated. Foregut carcinoids are the most likely to cause an atypical carcinoid syndrome.

One of the most immediate life-threatening complications of the carcinoid syndrome is the development of a carcinoid crisis. This is more common in patients who have intense symptoms or have greatly increased urinary 5-HIAA levels (i.e., >200 mg/d). The crises may occur spontaneously or be provoked by stress, anesthesia, chemotherapy, or a biopsy. Patients develop intense flushing, diarrhea, abdominal pain, cardiac abnormalities including tachycardia, hypertension, or hypotension. If not adequately treated, this can be a terminal event.

Diagnosis of the Carcinoid Syndrome and Carcinoid Tumors

The diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome relies on measurement of urinary or plasma serotonin or its metabolites in the urine. The measurement of 5-HIAA is used most frequently. False-positive elevations may occur if the patient is eating serotonin-rich foods such as bananas, pineapples, walnuts, pecans, avocados, or hickory nuts or is taking certain medications (cough syrup containing guaifenesin, acetaminophen, salicylates, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or l-dopa). The normal range in daily urinary 5-HIAA excretion is 2每8 mg/d. Serotonin overproduction was noted in 92% of patients with carcinoid syndrome in one study, and in another study, 5-HIAA had 73% sensitivity and 100% specificity for carcinoid syndrome.

Most physicians use only the urinary 5-HIAA excretion rate; however, plasma and platelet serotonin levels, if available, may provide additional information. Platelet serotonin levels are more sensitive than urinary 5-HIAA but are not generally available. Because patients with foregut carcinoids may produce an atypical carcinoid syndrome, if this syndrome is suspected and the urinary 5-HIAA is minimally elevated or normal, other urinary metabolites of tryptophan, such as 5-HTP and 5-HT, should be measured (Fig. 350-1).

Flushing occurs in a number of other diseases, including systemic mastocytosis, chronic myeloid leukemia with increased histamine release, menopause, reactions to alcohol or glutamate, side effects of chlorpropamide, calcium channel blockers, and nicotinic acid. None of these conditions cause increased urinary 5-HIAA.

The diagnosis of carcinoid tumor can be suggested by the carcinoid syndrome, recurrent abdominal symptoms in a healthy-appearing individual, or the discovery of hepatomegaly or hepatic metastases associated with minimal symptoms. Ileal carcinoids, which make up 25% of all clinically detected carcinoids, should be suspected in patients with bowel obstruction, abdominal pain, flushing, or diarrhea.

Serum chromogranin A levels are elevated in 56每100% of patients with carcinoid tumors, and the level correlates with tumor bulk. Serum chromogranin A levels are not specific for carcinoid tumors because they are also elevated in patients with PETs and other neuroendocrine tumors. Plasma neuron-specific enolase levels are also used as a marker of carcinoid tumors but are less sensitive than chromogranin A, being increased in only 17每47% of patients.

Treatment: Carcinoid Syndrome and Nonmetastatic Carcinoid Tumors


Carcinoid Syndrome

Treatment includes avoiding conditions that precipitate flushing, dietary supplementation with nicotinamide, treatment of heart failure with diuretics, treatment of wheezing with oral bronchodilators, and control of the diarrhea with antidiarrheal agents such as loperamide and diphenoxylate. If patients still have symptoms, serotonin receptor antagonists or somatostatin analogues (Fig. 350-2) are the drugs of choice.

Figure 350-2

 
 
 
Structure of somatostatin and synthetic analogues used for diagnostic or therapeutic indications.
 
 

There are 14 subclasses of serotonin receptors, and antagonists for many are not available. The 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor antagonists methylsergide, cyproheptadine, and ketanserin have all been used to control the diarrhea but usually do not decrease flushing. The use of methylsergide is limited because it can cause or enhance retroperitoneal fibrosis. Ketanserin diminishes diarrhea in 30每100% of patients. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (ondansetron, tropisetron, alosetron) can control diarrhea and nausea in up to 100% of patients and occasionally ameliorate the flushing. A combination of histamine H1 and H2 receptor antagonists (i.e., diphenhydramine and cimetidine or ranitidine) may control flushing in patients with foregut carcinoids.

Synthetic analogues of somatostatin (octreotide, lanreotide) are now the most widely used agents to control the symptoms of patients with carcinoid syndrome (Fig. 350-2). These drugs are effective at relieving symptoms and decreasing urinary 5-HIAA levels in patients with this syndrome. Octreotide-LAR and lanreotide-SR/autogel (Somatuline) control symptoms in 74% and 68%, respectively, of patients with carcinoid syndrome and show a biochemical response in 51% and 39%. Patients with mild to moderate symptoms usually are treated initially with octreotide 100 g SC every 8 h and begun on long-acting monthly depot forms (octreotide-LAR or lanreotide-autogel). Forty percent of patients escape control after a median time of 4 months, and the depot dosage may have to be increased as well as supplemented with the shorter-acting formulation, SC octreotide.

Carcinoid heart disease is associated with a decreased mean survival (3.8 years), and therefore it should be sought for and carefully assessed in all patients with carcinoid syndrome. Transthoracic echocardiography remains a key element in establishing the diagnosis of carcinoid heart disease and determining the extent and type of cardiac abnormalities. Treatment with diuretics and somatostatin analogues can reduce the negative hemodynamic effects and secondary heart failure. It remains unclear whether long-term treatment with these drugs will decrease the progression of carcinoid heart disease. Balloon valvuloplasty for stenotic valves or cardiac valve surgery may be required.

In patients with carcinoid crises, somatostatin analogues are effective at both treating the condition and preventing their development during known precipitating events such as surgery, anesthesia, chemotherapy, and stress. It is recommended that octreotide 150每250 g SC every 6 to 8 h be used 24每48 h before anesthesia and then continued throughout the procedure.

Currently, sustained-release preparations of both octreotide [octreotide-LAR (long-acting release), 10, 20, 30 mg] and lanreotide [lanreotide-PR (prolonged release, lanreotide-autogel), 60, 90, 120 mg] are available and widely used because their use greatly facilitates long-term treatment. Octreotide-LAR (30 mg/month) gives a plasma level 1 ng/mL for 25 days, whereas this requires three to six injections a day of the non-sustained-release form. Lanreotide autogel (Somatuline) is given every 4每6 weeks.

Short-term side effects occur in up to one-half of patients. Pain at the injection site and side effects related to the GI tract (59% discomfort, 15% nausea, diarrhea) are the most common. They are usually short-lived and do not interrupt treatment. Important long-term side effects include gallstone formation, steatorrhea, and deterioration in glucose tolerance. The overall incidence of gallstones/biliary sludge in one study was 52%, with 7% having symptomatic disease that required surgical treatment.

Interferon  is reported to be effective in controlling symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome either alone or combined with hepatic artery embolization. With interferon  alone the response rate is 42%, and with interferon  with hepatic artery embolization, diarrhea was controlled for 1 year in 43% and flushing was controlled in 86%.

Hepatic artery embolization alone or with chemotherapy (chemoembolization) has been used to control the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. Embolization alone is reported to control symptoms in up to 76% of patients, and chemoembolization (5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cisplatin, mitomycin) in 60每75% of patients. Hepatic artery embolization can have major side effects, including nausea, vomiting, pain, and fever. In two studies 5每7% of patients died from complications of hepatic artery occlusion.

Other drugs have been used successfully in small numbers of patients to control the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. Parachlorophenylanine can inhibit tryptophan hydroxylase and therefore the conversion of tryptophan to 5-HTP. However, its severe side effects, including psychiatric disturbances, make it intolerable for long-term use. -Methyldopa inhibits the conversion of 5-HTP to 5-HT, but its effects are only partial.

Peptide radioreceptor therapy (using radiotherapy with radiolabeled somatostatin analogues), the use of radiolabeled microspheres, and other methods for treatment of advanced metastatic disease may facilitate control of the carcinoid syndrome and are discussed in a later section dealing with treatment of advanced disease.

Carcinoid Tumors (Nonmetastatic)

Surgery is the only potentially curative therapy. Because with most carcinoids the probability of metastatic disease increases with increasing size, the extent of surgical resection is determined accordingly. With appendiceal carcinoids <1 cm, simple appendectomy was curative in 103 patients followed for up to 35 years. With rectal carcinoids <1 cm, local resection is curative. With small-intestinal carcinoids <1 cm, there is not complete agreement. Because 15每69% of small-intestinal carcinoids this size have metastases in different studies, some recommend a wide resection with en bloc resection of the adjacent lymph-bearing mesentery. If the carcinoid tumor is >2 cm for rectal, appendiceal, or small- intestinal carcinomas, a full cancer operation should be done. This includes a right hemicolectomy for appendiceal carcinoid, an abdominoperineal resection or low anterior resection for rectal carcinoids, and an en bloc resection of adjacent lymph nodes for small-intestinal carcinoids. For carcinoids 1每2 cm in diameter for appendiceal tumors, a simple appendectomy is proposed by some, whereas others favor a formal right hemicolectomy. For rectal carcinoids 1每2 cm, it is recommended that a wide local full-thickness excision be performed.

With type I or II gastric carcinoids, which are usually <1 cm, endoscopic removal is recommended. In type I or II gastric carcinoids, if the tumor is >2 cm or if there is local invasion, some recommend total gastrectomy, whereas others recommend antrectomy in type I to reduce the hypergastrinemia, which led to regression of the carcinoids in a number of studies. For types I and II gastric carcinoids of 1每2 cm, there is no agreement, with some recommending endoscopic treatment followed by chronic somatostatin treatment and careful follow-up and others recommending surgical treatment. With type III gastric carcinoids >2 cm, excision and regional lymph node clearance are recommended. Most tumors <1 cm are treated endoscopically.

Resection of isolated or limited hepatic metastases may be beneficial and will be discussed in a later section on treatment of advanced disease.
 
Pancreatic Endocrine Tumors

Functional PETs usually present clinically with symptoms due to the hormone-excess state. Only late in the course of the disease does the tumor per se cause prominent symptoms such as abdominal pain. In contrast, all the symptoms due to nonfunctional PETs are due to the tumor per se. The overall result of this is that some functional PETs may present with severe symptoms with a small or undetectable primary tumor, whereas nonfunctional tumors usually present late in the disease course with large tumors, which are frequently metastatic. The mean delay between onset of continuous symptoms and diagnosis of a functional PET syndrome is 4每7 years. Therefore, the diagnoses frequently are missed for extended periods.

Treatment: Pancreatic Endocrine Tumor

Treatment of PETs requires two different strategies. First, treatment must be directed at the hormone-excess state such as the gastric acid hypersecretion in gastrinomas or the hypoglycemia in insulinomas. Ectopic hormone secretion usually causes the presenting symptoms and can cause life-threatening complications. Second, with all the tumors except insulinomas, >50% are malignant (Table 350-2); therefore, treatment must also be directed against the tumor per se. Because in many patients these tumors are not surgically curable due to the presence of advanced disease at diagnosis, surgical resection for cure, which addresses both treatment aspects, is often not possible.

Gastrinoma (Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome) (Zes)

A gastrinoma is a neuroendocrine tumor that secretes gastrin; the resultant hypergastrinemia causes gastric acid hypersecretion (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). The chronic hypergastrinemia results in marked gastric acid hypersecretion and growth of the gastric mucosa with increased numbers of parietal cells and proliferation of gastric ECL cells. The gastric acid hypersecretion characteristically causes peptic ulcer disease, often refractory and severe, as well as diarrhea. The most common presenting symptoms are abdominal pain (70每100%), diarrhea (37每73%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (30每35%); 10每20% have diarrhea only. Although peptic ulcers may occur in unusual locations, most patients have a typical duodenal ulcer. Important observations that should suggest this diagnosis include peptic ulcer disease (PUD); with diarrhea; PUD in an unusual location or with multiple ulcers; PUD refractory to treatment or persistent; PUD associated with prominent gastric folds; PUD associated with findings suggestive of MEN 1 (endocrinopathy, family history of ulcer or endocrinopathy, nephrolithiases); and PUD without Helicobacter pylori present. H. pylori is present in >90% of idiopathic peptic ulcers but is present in <50% of patients with gastrinomas. Chronic unexplained diarrhea also should suggest gastrinoma.

Approximately 20每25% of patients with ZES have MEN 1, and in most cases hyperparathyroidism is present before the gastrinoma. These patients are treated differently from those without MEN 1; therefore, MEN 1 should be sought in all patients by family history and by measuring plasma ionized calcium and prolactin levels and plasma hormone levels (parathormone, growth hormone).

Most gastrinomas (50每70%) are present in the duodenum, followed by the pancreas (20每40%) and other intraabdominal sites (mesentery, lymph nodes, biliary tract, liver, stomach, ovary). Rarely, the tumor may involve extraabdominal sites. In MEN 1 the gastrinomas are also usually in the duodenum (70每90%), followed by the pancreas (10每30%), and are almost always multiple. About 60每90% of gastrinomas are malignant (Table 350-2) with metastatic spread to lymph nodes and liver. Distant metastases to bone occur in 12每30% of patients with liver metastases.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of ZES requires the demonstration of inappropriate fasting hypergastrinemia, usually by demonstrating hypergastrinemia occurring with an increased basal gastric acid output (BAO) (hyperchlorhydria). More than 98% of patients with gastrinomas have fasting hypergastrinemia, although in 40每60% the level may be elevated less than tenfold. Therefore, when the diagnosis is suspected, a fasting gastrin should be determined first. It is important to remember that potent gastric acid suppressant drugs such as proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole) can suppress acid secretion sufficiently to cause hypergastrinemia; because of their prolonged duration of action, these drugs have to be discontinued for a week before the gastrin determination. Withdrawal of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) should be performed carefully and is best done in consultation with GI units with experience in this area. The widespread use of PPIs can confound the diagnosis of ZES by raising a false-positive diagnosis by causing hypergastrinemia in a patient being treated with idiopathic peptic disease (without ZES) and lead to a false-negative diagnosis because at routine doses used to treat patients with idiopathic peptic disease, PPIs control symptoms in most ZES patients and thus mask the diagnosis. If ZES is suspected and the gastrin level is elevated, it is important to show that it is increased when gastric pH is 2.0 because physiologically hypergastrinemia secondary to achlorhydria (atrophic gastritis, pernicious anemia) is one of the most common causes of hypergastrinemia. Nearly all gastrinoma patients have a fasting pH 2 when off antisecretory drugs. If the fasting gastrin is >1000 pg/mL (increased tenfold) and the pH is 2.0, which occurs in 40每60% of patients with gastrinoma, the diagnosis of ZES is established after the possibility of retained antrum syndrome has been ruled out by history. In patients with hypergastrinemia with fasting gastrins <1000 pg/mL and gastric pH 2.0, other conditions, such as H. pylori infections, antral G-cell hyperplasia/hyperfunction, gastric outlet obstruction, and, rarely, renal failure, can masquerade as ZES. To establish the diagnosis in this group, a determination of BAO and a secretin provocative test should be done. In patients with ZES without previous gastric acid每reducing surgery, the BAO is usually (>90%) elevated (i.e., >15 meq/h). The secretin provocative test is usually positive, with the criterion of a >120-pg/mL increase over the basal level having the highest sensitivity (94%) and specificity (100%).

Treatment: Gastrinomas

Gastric acid hypersecretion in patients with gastrinomas can be controlled in almost every case by oral gastric antisecretory drugs. Because of their long duration of action and potency, which allows dosing once or twice a day, the PPIs (H+,K+-ATPase inhibitors) are the drugs of choice. Histamine H2-receptor antagonists are also effective, although more frequent dosing (q 4每8 h) and high doses are required. In patients with MEN 1 with hyperparathyroidism, correction of the hyperparathyroidism increases the sensitivity to gastric antisecretory drugs and decreases the basal acid output. Long-term treatment with PPIs (>15 years) has proved to be safe and effective, without development of tachyphylaxis. Although patients with ZES, especially those with MEN 1, more frequently develop gastric carcinoids, no data suggest that the long-term use of PPIs increases this risk in these patients. With long-term PPI use in ZES patients, vitamin B12 deficiency can develop; thus, vitamin B12 levels should be assessed during follow-up.

With the increased ability to control acid hypersecretion, more than 50% of patients who are not cured (>60% of patients) will die from tumor-related causes. At presentation, careful imaging studies are essential to localize the extent of the tumor. A third of patients present with hepatic metastases, and in <15% of those patients the disease is limited, so that surgical resection may be possible. Surgical short-term cure is possible in 60% of all patients without MEN 1 or liver metastases (40% of all patients) and in 30% of patients long-term. In patients with MEN 1, long-term surgical cure is rare because the tumors are multiple, frequently with lymph node metastases. Therefore, all patients with gastrinomas without MEN 1 or a medical condition that limits life expectancy should undergo surgery by a surgeon experienced in the treatment of these disorders.

Insulinomas

An insulinoma is an endocrine tumor of the pancreas that is thought to be derived from beta cells that ectopically secrete insulin, which results in hypoglycemia. The average age of occurrence is 40每50 years old. The most common clinical symptoms are due to the effect of the hypoglycemia on the CNS (neuroglycemic symptoms) and include confusion, headache, disorientation, visual difficulties, irrational behavior, and even coma. Also, most patients have symptoms due to excess catecholamine release secondary to the hypoglycemia, including sweating, tremor, and palpitations. Characteristically, these attacks are associated with fasting.

Insulinomas are generally small (>90% <2 cm) and usually not multiple (90%); only 5每15% are malignant, and they almost invariably occur only in the pancreas, distributed equally in the pancreatic head, body, and tail.

Insulinomas should be suspected in all patients with hypoglycemia, especially when there is a history suggesting that attacks are provoked by fasting, or with a family history of MEN 1. Insulin is synthesized as proinsulin, which consists of a 21-amino-acid  chain and a 30-amino-acid  chain connected by a 33-amino-acid connecting peptide (C peptide). In insulinomas, in addition to elevated plasma insulin levels, elevated plasma proinsulin levels are found, and C-peptide levels can be elevated.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of insulinoma requires the demonstration of an elevated plasma insulin level at the time of hypoglycemia. A number of other conditions may cause fasting hypoglycemia, such as the inadvertent or surreptitious use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, severe liver disease, alcoholism, poor nutrition, and other extrapancreatic tumors. Furthermore, postprandial hypoglycemia can be caused by a number of conditions that confuse the diagnosis of insulinoma. Particularly important here is the increased occurrence of hypoglycemia after gastric bypass surgery for obesity, which is now widely performed. The most reliable test to diagnose insulinoma is a fast up to 72 h with serum glucose, C-peptide, proinsulin, and insulin measurements every 4每8 h. If at any point the patient becomes symptomatic or glucose levels are persistently below <2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dL), the test should be terminated and repeat samples for the above studies should be obtained before glucose is given. Some 70每80% of patients will develop hypoglycemia during the first 24 h, and 98% by 48 h. In nonobese normal subjects, serum insulin levels should decrease to <43 pmol/L (<6 U/mL) when blood glucose decreases to <2.2 mmol/L (<40 mg/dL) and the ratio of insulin to glucose is <0.3 (in mg/dL). In addition to having an insulin level >6 U/mL when blood glucose is <40 mg/dL, some investigators also require an elevated C-peptide and serum proinsulin level, an insulin/glucose ratio >0.3, and a decreased plasma -hydroxybutyrate level for the diagnosis of insulinomas. Surreptitious use of insulin or hypoglycemic agents may be difficult to distinguish from insulinomas. The combination of proinsulin levels (normal in exogenous insulin/hypoglycemic agent users), C-peptide levels (low in exogenous insulin users), antibodies to insulin (positive in exogenous insulin users), and measurement of sulfonylurea levels in serum or plasma will allow the correct diagnosis to be made. The diagnosis of insulinoma has been complicated by the introduction of specific insulin assays that do not also interact with proinsulin, as do many of the older radioimmunoassays (RIAs), and therefore give lower plasma insulin levels. The increased use of these specific insulin assays has resulted in increased numbers of patients with insulinomas having lower plasma insulin values than the 6 U/mL levels proposed to be characteristic of insulinomas by RIA. In these patients the assessment of proinsulin and C-peptide levels at the time of hypoglycemia is particularly helpful for establishing the correct diagnosis. An elevated proinsulin level when the fasting glucose level is <45 mg/dL is sensitive and specific.

Treatment: Insulinomas

Only 5每15% of insulinomas are malignant; therefore, after appropriate imaging (see below), surgery should be performed. In different studies, 75每100% of patients are cured by surgery. Before surgery, the hypoglycemia can be controlled by frequent small meals and the use of diazoxide (150每800 mg/d). Diazoxide is a benzothiadiazide whose hyperglycemic effect is attributed to inhibition of insulin release. Its side effects are sodium retention and GI symptoms such as nausea. Approximately 50每60% of patients respond to diazoxide. Other agents effective in some patients to control the hypoglycemia include verapamil and diphenylhydantoin. Long-acting somatostatin analogues such as octreotide and lanreotide are acutely effective in 40% of patients. However, octreotide must be used with care because it inhibits growth hormone secretion and can alter plasma glucagon levels; therefore, in some patients it can worsen the hypoglycemia.

For the 5每15% of patients with malignant insulinomas, these drugs or somatostatin analogues are used initially. In a small number of patients with insulinomas, some with malignant tumors, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) inhibitors (everolimus, rapamycin) are reported to control the hypoglycemia. If they are not effective, various antitumor treatments such as hepatic arterial embolization, chemoembolization, chemotherapy, and peptide receptor radiotherapy have been used (see below).

Insulinomas, which are usually benign (>90%) and intrapancreatic in location, are increasingly resected using a laparoscopic approach, which has lower morbidity rates. This approach requires that the insulinoma be localized on preoperative imaging studies.

Glucagonomas

A glucagonoma is an endocrine tumor of the pancreas that secretes excessive amounts of glucagon, which causes a distinct syndrome characterized by dermatitis, glucose intolerance or diabetes, and weight loss. Glucagonomas principally occur between 45 and 70 years of age. The tumor is clinically heralded by a characteristic dermatitis (migratory necrolytic erythema) (67每90%), accompanied by glucose intolerance (40每90%), weight loss (66每96%), anemia (33每85%), diarrhea (15每29%), and thromboembolism (11每24%). The characteristic rash usually starts as an annular erythema at intertriginous and periorificial sites, especially in the groin or buttock. It subsequently becomes raised, and bullae form; when the bullae rupture, eroded areas form. The lesions can wax and wane. The development of a similar rash in patients receiving glucagon therapy suggests that the rash is a direct effect of the hyperglucagonemia. A characteristic laboratory finding is hypoaminoacidemia, which occurs in 26每100% of patients.

Glucagonomas are generally large tumors at diagnosis (5每10 cm). Some 50每80% occur in the pancreatic tail. From 50 to 82% have evidence of metastatic spread at presentation, usually to the liver. Glucagonomas are rarely extrapancreatic and usually occur singly.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating an increased plasma glucagon level. Characteristically, plasma glucagon levels exceed 1000 pg/mL (normal is <150 pg/mL) in 90%; 7% are between 500 and 1000 pg/mL, and 3% are <500 pg/mL. A trend toward lower levels at diagnosis has been noted in the last decade. A plasma glucagon level >1000 pg/mL is considered diagnostic of glucagonoma. Other diseases causing increased plasma glucagon levels include renal insufficiency, acute pancreatitis, hypercorticism, hepatic insufficiency, severe stress, and prolonged fasting or familial hyperglucagonemia, as well as danazol treatment. With the exception of cirrhosis, these disorders do not increase plasma glucagon >500 pg/mL.

Necrolytic migratory erythema is not pathognomonic for glucagonoma and occurs in myeloproliferative disorders, hepatitis B infection, malnutrition, short-bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and malabsorption disorders.

Treatment: Glucagonomas

In 50每80% of patients, hepatic metastases are present, and so curative surgical resection is not possible. Surgical debulking in patients with advanced disease or other antitumor treatments may be beneficial (see below). Long-acting somatostatin analogues such as octreotide and lanreotide improve the skin rash in 75% of patients and may improve the weight loss, pain, and diarrhea but usually do not improve the glucose intolerance.

Somatostatinoma Syndrome

The somatostatinoma syndrome is due to an NET that secretes excessive amounts of somatostatin, which causes a distinct syndrome characterized by diabetes mellitus, gallbladder disease, diarrhea, and steatorrhea. There is no general distinction in the literature between a tumor that contains somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (somatostatinoma) and does (11每45%) or does not (55每90%) produce a clinical syndrome (somatostatinoma syndrome) by secreting somatostatin. In a review of 173 cases of somatostatinomas, only 11% were associated with the somatostatinoma syndrome. The mean age is 51 years. Somatostatinomas occur primarily in the pancreas and small intestine, and the frequency of the symptoms and occurrence of the somatostatinoma syndrome differ in each. Each of the usual symptoms is more common in pancreatic than in intestinal somatostatinomas: diabetes mellitus (95% vs. 21%), gallbladder disease (94% vs. 43%), diarrhea (92% vs. 38%), steatorrhea (83% vs. 12%), hypochlorhydria (86% vs. 12%), and weight loss (90% vs. 69%). The somatostatinoma syndrome occurs in 30每90% of pancreatic and 0每5% of small-intestinal somatostatinomas. In various series 43% of all duodenal NETs contain somatostatin; however, the somatostatinoma syndrome is rarely present (<2%). Somatostatinomas occur in the pancreas in 56每74% of cases, with the primary location being the pancreatic head. The tumors are usually solitary (90%) and large (mean size 4.5 cm). Liver metastases are common, being present in 69每84% of patients. Somatostatinomas are rare in patients with MEN 1, occurring in only 0.65%.

Somatostatin is a tetradecapeptide that is widely distributed in the CNS and GI tract, where it functions as a neurotransmitter or has paracrine and autocrine actions. It is a potent inhibitor of many processes, including release of almost all hormones, acid secretion, intestinal and pancreatic secretion, and intestinal absorption. Most of the clinical manifestations are directly related to these inhibitory actions.

Diagnosis

In most cases somatostatinomas have been found by accident either at the time of cholecystectomy or during endoscopy. The presence of psammoma bodies in a duodenal tumor should particularly raise suspicion. Duodenal somatostatin-containing tumors are increasingly associated with von Recklinghausen's disease. Most of these tumors (>98%) do not cause the somatostatinoma syndrome. The diagnosis of the somatostatinoma syndrome requires the demonstration of elevated plasma somatostatin levels.

Treatment: Somatostatinomas

Pancreatic tumors are frequently (70每92%) metastatic at presentation, whereas 30每69% of small-intestinal somatostatinomas have metastases. Surgery is the treatment of choice for those without widespread hepatic metastases. Symptoms in patients with the somatostatinoma syndrome are also improved by octreotide treatment.

Vipomas

VIPomas are endocrine tumors that secrete excessive amounts of vasoactive intestinal peptide, which causes a distinct syndrome characterized by large-volume diarrhea, hypokalemia, and dehydration. This syndrome also is called Verner-Morrison syndrome, pancreatic cholera, and WDHA syndrome for watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria, which some patients develop. The mean age of patients with this syndrome is 49 years; however, it can occur in children, and when it does, it is usually caused by a ganglioneuroma or ganglioneuroblastoma.

The principal symptoms are large-volume diarrhea (100%) severe enough to cause hypokalemia (80每100%), dehydration (83%), hypochlorhydria (54每76%), and flushing (20%). The diarrhea is secretory in nature, persisting during fasting, and is almost always >1 L/d and in 70% is >3 L/d. In a number of studies, the diarrhea was intermittent initially in up to half the patients. Most patients do not have accompanying steatorrhea (16%), and the increased stool volume is due to increased excretion of sodium and potassium, which, with the anions, accounts for the osmolality of the stool. Patients frequently have hyperglycemia (25每50%) and hypercalcemia (25每50%).

VIP is a 28-amino-acid peptide that is an important neurotransmitter, ubiquitously present in the CNS and GI tract. Its known actions include stimulation of small-intestinal chloride secretion as well as effects on smooth muscle contractility, inhibition of acid secretion, and vasodilatory effects, which explain most features of the clinical syndrome.

In adults 80每90% of VIPomas are pancreatic in location, with the rest due to VIP-secreting pheochromocytomas, intestinal carcinoids, and rarely ganglioneuromas. These tumors are usually solitary, 50每75% are in the pancreatic tail, and 37每68% have hepatic metastases at diagnosis. In children <10 years old, the syndrome is usually due to ganglioneuromas or ganglioblastomas and is less often malignant (10%).

Diagnosis

The diagnosis requires the demonstration of an elevated plasma VIP level and the presence of large-volume diarrhea. A stool volume <700 mL/d is proposed to exclude the diagnosis of VIPoma. When the patient fasts, a number of diseases can be excluded that can cause marked diarrhea. Other diseases that can produce a secretory large-volume diarrhea include gastrinomas, chronic laxative abuse, carcinoid syndrome, systemic mastocytosis, rarely medullary thyroid cancer, diabetic diarrhea, sprue, and AIDS. Among these conditions, only VIPomas caused a marked increase in plasma VIP. Chronic surreptitious use of laxatives/diuretics can be particularly difficult to detect clinically. Hence, in a patient with unexplained chronic diarrhea, screens for laxatives should be performed; they will detect many, but not all, laxative abusers.

Treatment: Vasoactive Intestinal Peptidomas

The most important initial treatment in these patients is to correct their dehydration, hypokalemia, and electrolyte losses with fluid and electrolyte replacement. These patients may require 5 L/d of fluid and >350 meq/d of potassium. Because 37每68% of adults with VIPomas have metastatic disease in the liver at presentation, a significant number of patients cannot be cured surgically. In these patients long-acting somatostatin analogues such as octreotide and lanreotide are the drugs of choice.

Octreotide/lanreotide will control the diarrhea short- and long-term in 75每100% of patients. In nonresponsive patients the combination of glucocorticoids and octreotide/lanreotide has proved helpful in a small number of patients. Other drugs reported to be helpful in small numbers of patients include prednisone (60每100 mg/d), clonidine, indomethacin, phenothiazines, loperamide, lidamidine, lithium, propranolol, and metoclopramide. Treatment of advanced disease with embolization, chemoembolization, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, and peptide receptor radiotherapy may be helpful (see below).

Nonfunctional Pancreatic Endocrine Tumors (NF-Pets)

NF-PETs are endocrine tumors that originate in the pancreas and secrete no products, or their products do not cause a specific clinical syndrome. The symptoms are due entirely to the tumor per se. NF-PETs secrete chromogranin A (90每100%), chromogranin B (90每100%), PP (58%), -HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) (40%), and -HCG (20%). Because the symptoms are due to the tumor mass, patients with NF-PETs usually present late in the disease course with invasive tumors and hepatic metastases (64每92%) and the tumors are usually large (72% >5 cm). NF-PETs are usually solitary except in patients with MEN 1, in which case they are multiple. They occur primarily in the pancreatic head. Even though these tumors do not cause a functional syndrome, immunocytochemical studies show that they synthesize numerous peptides and cannot be distinguished from functional tumors by immunocytochemistry. In MEN 1, 80每100% of patients have microscopic NF-PETs, but they become large or symptomatic in only a minority (0每13%) of cases. In VHL 12每17% develop NF-PETs, and in 4% they are 3 cm in diameter.

The most common symptoms are abdominal pain (30每80%), jaundice (20每35%), and weight loss, fatigue, or bleeding; 10每30% are found incidentally. The average time from the beginning of symptoms to diagnosis is 5 years.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis is established by histologic confirmation in a patient without either the clinical symptoms or the elevated plasma hormone levels of one of the established syndromes. The principal difficulty in diagnosis is to distinguish an NF-PET from a nonendocrine pancreatic tumor, which is more common. Even though chromogranin A levels are elevated in almost every patient, this is not specific for this disease as it can be found in functional PETs, carcinoids, and other neuroendocrine disorders. Plasma pancreatic polypeptide is increased in 22每71% of patients and should strongly suggest the diagnosis in a patient with a pancreatic mass because it is usually normal in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Elevated plasma PP is not diagnostic of this tumor because it is elevated in a number of other conditions, such as chronic renal failure, old age, inflammatory conditions, and diabetes. A positive somatostatin receptor scan in a patient with a pancreatic mass should suggest the presence of PET/NF-PET rather than a nonendocrine tumor.

Treatment: Nonfunctional Pancreatic Endocrine Tumors

Overall survival in patients with sporadic NF-PET is 30每63% at 5 years, with a median survival of 6 years. Unfortunately, surgical curative resection can be considered only in a minority of these patients because 64每92% present with metastatic disease. Treatment needs to be directed against the tumor per se using the various modalities discussed below for advanced disease. The treatment of NF-PETs in either MEN 1 patients or patients with VHL is controversial. Most recommend surgical resection for any tumor >2每3 cm in diameter; however, there is no consensus on smaller NF-PETs, with most recommending careful surveillance of these patients.

Grfomas

GRFomas are endocrine tumors that secrete excessive amounts of growth hormone每releasing factor (GRF) that cause acromegaly. GRF is a 44-amino-acid peptide, and 25每44% of PETs have GRF immunoreactivity, although it is uncommonly secreted. GRFomas are lung tumors in 47每54% of cases, PETs in 29每30%, and small-intestinal carcinoids in 8每10%; up to 12% occur at other sites. Patients have a mean age of 38 years, and the symptoms usually are due to either acromegaly or the tumor per se. The acromegaly caused by GRFomas is indistinguishable from classic acromegaly. The pancreatic tumors are usually large (>6 cm), and liver metastases are present in 39%. They should be suspected in any patient with acromegaly and an abdominal tumor, a patient with MEN 1 with acromegaly, or a patient without a pituitary adenoma with acromegaly or associated with hyperprolactinemia, which occurs in 70% of GRFomas. GRFomas are an uncommon cause of acromegaly. GRFomas occur in <1% of MEN 1 patients. The diagnosis is established by performing plasma assays for GRF and growth hormone. Most GRFomas have a plasma GRF level >300 pg/mL (normal <5 pg/mL men, <10 pg/mL women). Patients with GRFomas also have increased plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor type I (IGF-I) levels similar to those in classic acromegaly. Surgery is the treatment of choice if diffuse metastases are not present. Long-acting somatostatin analogues such as octreotide and lanreotide are the agents of choice, with 75每100% of patients responding.

Other Rare Pancreatic Endocrine Tumor Syndromes

Cushing's syndrome (ACTHoma) due to a PET occurs in 4每16% of all ectopic Cushing's syndrome cases. It occurs in 5% of cases of sporadic gastrinomas, almost invariably in patients with hepatic metastases, and is an independent poor prognostic factor. Paraneoplastic hypercalcemia due to PETs releasing parathyroid hormone每related peptide (PTHrP), a PTH-like material, or unknown factor, is rarely reported. The tumors are usually large, and liver metastases are usually present. Most (88%) appear to be due to release of PTHrP. PETs occasionally can cause the carcinoid syndrome. PETs secreting calcitonin have been proposed as a specific clinical syndrome. One-half of the patients have diarrhea, which disappears with resection of the tumor. The proposal that this could be a discrete syndrome is supported by the finding that 25每42% of patients with medullary thyroid cancer with hypercalcitonemia develop diarrhea, probably secondary to a motility disorder. This is classified in Table 350-2 as a possible specific disorder because so few cases have been described. Similarly classified with only a few cases described are a renin-producing PET in a patient presenting with hypertension; PETs secreting luteinizing hormone, resulting in masculinization or decreased libido; a PET-secreting erythropoietin resulting in polycythemia; and PETs secreting insulin-like growth factor II causing hypoglycemia (Table 350-2). Ghrelin is a 28-amino-acid peptide with a number of metabolic functions. Even though it is detectable immunohistochemically in most PETs, no specific syndrome is associated with release of ghrelin by the PET.
 
Tumor Localization

Localization of the primary tumor and knowledge of the extent of the disease are essential to the proper management of all carcinoids and PETs. Without proper localization studies it is not possible to determine whether the patient is a candidate for curative resection or cytoreductive surgery or requires antitumor treatment or to predict the patient's prognosis reliably.

Numerous tumor localization methods are used in both types of NETs, including conventional imaging studies (computed tomographic scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, transabdominal ultrasound, selective angiography), somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS), and positron emission tomographic scanning. In PETs, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and functional localization by measuring venous hormonal gradients are also reported to be useful. Bronchial carcinoids are usually detected by standard chest radiography and assessed by CT. Rectal, duodenal, colonic, and gastric carcinoids are usually detected by GI endoscopy.

PETs, as well as carcinoid tumors, frequently overexpress high-affinity somatostatin receptors in both their primary tumors and their metastases. Of the five types of somatostatin receptors (sst1每5), radiolabeled octreotide binds with high affinity to sst2 and sst5, has a lower affinity for sst3, and has a very low affinity for sst1 and sst4. Between 90 and 100% of carcinoid tumors and PETs possess sst2, and many also have the other four sst subtypes. Interaction with these receptors can be used to localize NETs by using [111In-DTPA-d-Phe1]octreotide and radionuclide scanning (SRS) as well as for treatment of the hormone-excess state with octreotide or lanreotide, as discussed earlier. Because of its sensitivity and ability to localize tumor throughout the body, SRS is the initial imaging modality of choice for localizing both the primary and metastatic NETs. SRS localizes tumor in 73每89% of patients with carcinoids and in 56每100% of patients with PETs, except insulinomas. Insulinomas are usually small and have low densities of sst receptors, resulting in SRS being positive in only 12每50% of patients with insulinomas. Figure 350-3 shows an example of the increased sensitivity of SRS in a patient with a carcinoid tumor. The CT scan showed a single liver metastasis, whereas the SRS demonstrated three metastases in the liver in multiple locations. Occasional false-positive responses with SRS can occur (12% in one study) because numerous other normal tissues as well as diseases can have high densities of sst receptors, including granulomas (sarcoid, tuberculosis, etc.), thyroid diseases (goiter, thyroiditis), and activated lymphocytes (lymphomas, wound infections). For PETs in the pancreas, EUS is highly sensitive, localizing 77每100% of insulinomas, which occur almost exclusively within the pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasound is less sensitive for extrapancreatic tumors. It is increasingly used in patients with MEN 1 and to a lesser extent VHL to detect small PETs not seen with other modalities or for serial PET assessments to determine size changes or rapid growth in patients in whom surgery is deferred. EUS with cytologic evaluation also is used frequently to distinguish an NF-PET from a pancreatic adenocarcinoma or another nonendocrine pancreatic tumor.

Insulinomas overexpress receptors for GLP-1; a radiolabeled GLP-1 analogue can detect occult insulinomas not localized by other imaging modalities. Functional localization by measuring hormonal gradients is now uncommonly used with gastrinomas (after intraarterial secretin injections) but is still frequently used in insulinoma patients in whom other imaging studies are negative (assessing hepatic vein insulin concentrations post-intraarterial calcium injections). The intraarterial calcium test may also allow differentiation of the cause of the hypoglycemia and indicate whether it is due to an insulinoma or a nesidioblastosis. The latter entity is becoming increasingly important because hypoglycemia after gastric bypass surgery for obesity is increasing in frequency, and it is primarily due to nesidioblastosis, although it can occasionally be due to an insulinoma.

If liver metastases are identified by SRS, to plan the proper treatment either a CT or an MRI is recommended to assess the size and exact location of the metastases because SRS does not provide information on tumor size. Functional localization measuring hormone gradients after intraarterial calcium injections in insulinomas (insulin) or gastrin gradients after secretin injections in gastrinoma is a sensitive method, being positive in 80每100% of patients. However, this method provides only regional localization and therefore is reserved for cases in which the other imaging modalities are negative.

Two newer imaging modalities (positron emission tomography and use of hybrid scanners such as CT and SRS) may have increased sensitivity. Positron emission tomographic scanning with 18F-fluoro-DOPA in patients with carcinoids or with 11C-5-HTP or 68gallium-labeled somatostatin analogues in patients with PETs or carcinoids has greater sensitivity than conventional imaging studies or SRS and probably will be used increasingly in the future. Positron emission tomographic scanning for GI NETs is not currently approved in the United States.

Treatment: Advanced Disease (Diffuse Metastatic Disease)

The single most important prognostic factor for survival is the presence of liver metastases (Fig. 350-4). For patients with foregut carcinoids without hepatic metastases, the 5-year survival in one study was 95%, and with distant metastases, it was 20% (Fig. 350-4, bottom). With gastrinomas the 5-year survival without liver metastases is 98%; with limited metastases in one hepatic lobe, it is 78%; and with diffuse metastases, 16% (Fig. 350-4, top). In a large study of 156 patients (67 PETs, rest carcinoids) the overall 5-year survival rate was 77%; it was 96% without liver metastases, 73% with liver metastases, and 50% with distant disease. Therefore, treatment for advanced metastatic disease is an important challenge. A number of different modalities are reported to be effective, including cytoreductive surgery [surgically or by radio frequency ablation (RFA)], treatment with chemotherapy, somatostatin analogues, interferon , hepatic embolization alone or with chemotherapy (chemoembolization), radiotherapy with radiolabeled beads/microspheres, peptide radio-receptor therapy, and liver transplantation.

Bottom panel is drawn from data from 71 patients with foregut carcinoid tumors from EW McDermott et al: Br J Surg 81:1007, 1994.)
 
 

Specific Antitumor Treatments

Cytoreductive surgery, unfortunately, is possible in only 9每22% of patients who present with limited hepatic metastases. Although no randomized studies have proved that it extends life, results from a number of studies suggest that it probably increases survival; therefore, it is recommended, if possible. Radio frequency thermal ablation can be applied to GI NET liver metastases if they are limited in number (usually <5) and size (usually <3.5 cm in diameter). Response rates are >80%, the morbidity rate is low, and this procedure may be particularly helpful in patients with functional PETs that are difficult to control medically.

Chemotherapy for metastatic carcinoid tumors has generally been disappointing, with response rates of 0每40% with various two- and three-drug combinations. Chemotherapy for PETs has been more successful, with tumor shrinkage reported in 30每70% of patients. The current regimen of choice is streptozotocin and doxorubicin. In poorly differentiated PETs, chemotherapy with cisplatin, etoposide, or their derivatives is the recommended treatment, with response rates of 40每70%; however, responses are generally short-lived. Some newer combinations of chemotherapeutic agents show promise in small numbers of patients, including temozolomide (TMZ) alone, especially in PETs, which frequently have O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase deficiency, which increases their TMZ sensitivity (34% response rate), and TMZ plus capecitabine (response rate 59每71%, retrospective studies).

Long-acting somatostatin analogues such as octreotide, lanreotide, and interferon  rarely decrease tumor size (i.e., 0每17%); however, these drugs have tumoristatic effects, stopping additional growth in 26每95% of patients with NETs. A randomized, double-blind study in patients with metastatic midgut carcinoids demonstrated a marked lengthening of time to progression (14.3 vs. 6 months, p = .000072) from the use of octreotide-LAR. This improvement was seen in patients with limited liver involvement. Whether this change will result in extended survival has not been proved. Somatostatin analogues can induce apoptosis in carcinoid tumors, and interferon  can decrease Bcl-2 protein expression, which probably contributes to its antiproliferative effects.

Hepatic embolization and chemoembolization (with dacarbazine, cisplatin, doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, or streptozotocin) have been reported to decrease tumor bulk and help control the symptoms of the hormone-excess state. These modalities generally are reserved for liver-directed therapy in cases in which treatment with somatostatin analogues, interferon (carcinoids), or chemotherapy (PETs) fails. Embolization, when combined with treatment with octreotide and interferon , significantly reduces tumor progression (p = .008) compared with treatment with embolization and octreotide alone in patients with advanced midgut carcinoids.

Radiotherapy with radiolabeled somatostatin analogues that are internalized by the tumors is being investigated. Three different radionuclides are being used. High doses of [111In-DTPA-d-Phe1]octreotide, which emits -rays, internal conversion, and Auger electrons; yttrium-90, which emits high-energy -particles coupled by a DOTA chelating group to octreotide or octreotate; and 177lutetium-coupled analogues, which emit both, are all in clinical studies. 111Indium-, 90yttrium-, and 177lutetium-labeled compounds caused tumor stabilization in 41每81%, 44每88%, and 23每40%, respectively, and a decrease in tumor size in 8每30%, 6每37%, and 38%, respectively, of patients with advanced metastatic NETs. Use of 177Lu-labeled analogues to treat 504 patients with malignant NETs produced a reduction of tumor size of >50% in 30% of patients (2% complete) and tumor stabilization in 51%. An effect on survival has not been established. These results suggest that this novel therapy may be helpful, especially in patients with widespread metastatic disease.

Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) using 90yttrium glass or resin microspheres is being evaluated in patients with unresectable NET liver metastases. The treatment requires careful evaluation for vascular shunting before treatment and generally is reserved for patients without extrahepatic metastatic disease and with adequate hepatic reserve. The 90Y-microspheres are delivered to the liver by intraarterial injection from percutaneous placed catheters. In four studies involving metastatic NETs, the response rate varied from 50每61% (partial or complete), tumor stabilization occurred in 22每41%, and overall survival varied from 25每70 months. In the largest study (148 patients), no radiation-induced liver failure occurred and the most common side effect was fatigue (6.5%).

The use of liver transplantation has been abandoned for treatment of most metastatic tumors to the liver. However, for metastatic NETs, it is still a consideration. In a review of 103 cases of malignant NETs (48 PETs, 43 carcinoids) the 2- and 5-year survival rates were 60% and 47%, respectively. However, recurrence-free survival was low (<24%). For younger patients with metastatic NETs limited to the liver, liver transplantation may be justified.

Newer approaches show some promise in the treatment of advanced GI NETs. They include the use of growth factor inhibitors or inhibitors of their receptors (using tyrosine kinase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies), inhibitors of mTor signaling (everolimus, temsirolimus), angiogenesis inhibitors, and VEGF or vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors. A number of these agents, particularly sunitinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor), various mTor inhibitors, and bevacizumub (monoclonal antibody against VEGF), show impressive activity. Additional value may result from selected combinations of agents.

Neoplastic Disorders Affecting Multiple Endocrine Organs

Multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome is defined as a disorder with neoplasms in two or more different hormonal tissues in several members of a family. Several distinct genetic disorders predispose to endocrine gland neoplasia and cause hormone excess syndromes (Table 351-1). DNA-based genetic testing is available for these disorders, but effective management requires an understanding of endocrine neoplasia and the range of clinical features that may be manifested in an individual patient.

Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (Men) Type 1

MEN 1, or Wermer's syndrome, is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. This syndrome is characterized by neoplasia of the parathyroid glands, enteropancreatic tumors, anterior pituitary adenomas, and other neuroendocrine tumors with variable penetrance (Table 351-1). Although rare, MEN 1 is the most common multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome, with an estimated prevalence of 2每20 per 100,000 in the general population. It is caused by inactivating mutations of the tumor-suppressor gene MEN1 located at chromosome 11q13. The MEN1 gene codes for a nuclear protein called Menin. Menin interacts with JunD, suppressing JunD-dependent transcriptional activation. It is unclear how this accounts for Menin growth regulatory activity, since JunD is associated with inhibition of cell growth. Each child born to an affected parent has a 50% probability of inheriting the gene. The variable penetrance of the several neoplastic components can make the differential diagnosis and treatment challenging.

Clinical Manifestations

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common manifestation of MEN 1, with an estimated penetrance of 95每100%. Hypercalcemia may develop during the teenage years, and most individuals are affected by age 40 (Fig. 351-1). Hyperparathyroidism is the earliest manifestation of the syndrome in most MEN 1 patients. The neoplastic changes in hyperparathyroidism provide a specific example of one of the cardinal features of endocrine tumors in MEN 1: multicentricity. The neoplastic changes inevitably affect multiple parathyroid glands, making surgical cure difficult. Screening for hyperparathyroidism involves measurement of either an albumin-adjusted or an ionized serum calcium level. The diagnosis is established by demonstrating elevated levels of serum calcium and intact parathyroid hormone. Manifestations of hyperparathyroidism in MEN 1 do not differ substantially from those in sporadic hyperparathyroidism and include calcium-containing kidney stones, kidney failure, nephrocalcinosis, bone abnormalities (i.e., osteoporosis, osteitis fibrosa cystica), and gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal complaints. Management is challenging because of early onset, significant recurrence rates, and the multiplicity of parathyroid gland involvement. Differentiation of hyperparathyroidism of MEN 1 from other forms of familial primary hyperparathyroidism usually is based on family history, histologic features of resected parathyroid tissue, the presence of a MEN1 mutation, and, sometimes, long-term observation to determine whether other manifestations of MEN 1 develop. Parathyroid hyperplasia is the most common cause of hyperparathyroidism in MEN 1, although single and multiple adenomas have been described. Hyperplasia of one or more parathyroid glands is common in younger patients; adenomas usually are found in older patients or those with long-standing disease.

The rate of diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism increased sharply between ages 16 and 20 years. (Reprinted with permission from S Marx et al: Ann Intern Med 129:484, 1998.)
 
 

Enteropancreatic tumors are the second most common manifestation of MEN 1, with an estimated penetrance of 50%. They tend to occur in parallel with hyperparathyroidism (Fig. 351-1); 30% are malignant. Most of these tumors secrete peptide hormones that cause specific clinical syndromes. Those syndromes, however, may have an insidious onset and a slow progression, making their diagnosis difficult and in many cases delayed. Some enteropancreatic tumors do not secrete hormones. Those "silent" tumors usually are found during radiographic screening. Metastasis, most commonly to the liver, occurs in about a third of patients.

Gastrinomas are the most common enteropancreatic tumors observed in MEN 1 patients and result in the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES). ZES is caused by excessive gastrin production and occurs in more than one-half of MEN 1 patients with small carcinoid- like tumors in the duodenal wall or, less often, by pancreatic islet cell tumors. There may be more than one gastrin-producing tumor, making localization difficult. The robust acid production may cause esophagitis, duodenal ulcers throughout the duodenum, ulcers involving the proximal jejunum, and diarrhea. The ulcer diathesis is commonly refractory to conservative therapy such as antacids. The diagnosis is made by finding increased gastric acid secretion, elevated basal gastrin levels in the serum [generally >115 pmol/L (200 pg/mL)], and an exaggerated response of serum gastrin to either secretin or calcium. Other causes of elevated serum gastrin levels, such as achlorhydria, treatment with H2 receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors, retained gastric antrum, small-bowel resection, gastric outlet obstruction, and hypercalcemia, should be excluded (Fig. 351-1). High-resolution, early-phase CT scanning, abdominal MRI with contrast, octreotide scan, and/or endoscopic ultrasound are the best preoperative techniques for identification of the primary and metastatic gastrinoma; intraoperative ultrasonography is the most sensitive method for detection of small tumors. Approximately one-fourth of all cases of ZES occur in the context of MEN 1.

Insulinomas are the second most common enteropancreatic tumors in patients who have MEN 1. Unlike gastrinomas, most insulinomas originate in the pancreas bed, becoming the most common pancreatic tumor in MEN 1. Hypoglycemia caused by insulinomas is observed in about one-third of MEN 1 patients with pancreatic islet cell tumors (Fig. 351-1). The tumors may be benign or malignant (25%). The diagnosis can be suggested by documenting hypoglycemia during a short fast with simultaneous inappropriate elevation of serum insulin and C-peptide levels. More commonly, it is necessary to subject the patient to a supervised 12- to 72-h fast to provoke hypoglycemia (Chap. 345). Large insulinomas may be identified by CT or MRI scanning; small tumors not detected by conventional radiographic techniques may be localized by endoscopic ultrasound or selective arteriographic injection of calcium into each of the arteries that supply the pancreas and sampling of the hepatic vein for insulin to determine the anatomic region containing the tumor. Intraoperative ultrasonography is used frequently to localize these tumors. The trend toward earlier diagnosis of, hence, smaller tumors has reduced the usefulness of octreotide scanning, which is positive in a minority of these patients.

Glucagonoma, which is seen occasionally in MEN 1, causes a syndrome of hyperglycemia, skin rash (necrolytic migratory erythema), anorexia, glossitis, anemia, depression, diarrhea, and venous thrombosis. In about half of these patients the plasma glucagon level is high, leading to its designation as the glucagonoma syndrome, although elevation of the plasma glucagon level in MEN 1 patients is not necessarily associated with these symptoms. Some patients with this syndrome also have elevated plasma ghrelin levels. The glucagonoma syndrome may represent a complex interaction between glucagon and ghrelin overproduction and the nutritional status of the patient.

The Verner-Morrison, or watery diarrhea, syndrome consists of watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, hypochlorhydria, and metabolic acidosis. The diarrhea can be voluminous and almost always is found in association with an islet cell tumor in the context of MEN 1, prompting use of the term pancreatic cholera. However, when not associated with MEN 1, the syndrome outside of MEN 1 is not restricted to pancreatic islet tumors and has been observed with carcinoids or other tumors. This syndrome is believed to be due to overproduction of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), although plasma VIP levels may not be elevated. Hypercalcemia may be induced by the effects of VIP to stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption as well as by hyperparathyroidism. Other disorders that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea include infectious or parasitic diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, sprue, and other endocrine causes such as ZES, carcinoid, and medullary thyroid carcinoma.

The pancreatic neoplasms differ from the other components of MEN 1 in that approximately one-third of the tumors display malignant features, including hepatic metastases. The pancreatic neoplasms also can be used to highlight another characteristic of MEN 1: the specific impact of a hormone produced by one component of MEN 1 on another neoplastic component of this syndrome. Specific examples include the effects of either corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) or growth hormone每releasing hormone (GHRH) production by an islet cell tumor to cause a syndrome of excess adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) (Cushing's disease) or GH (acromegaly) production by the pituitary gland. These secondary interactions add complexity to the diagnosis and management of these tumor syndromes. Pancreatic islet cell tumors are diagnosed by identification of a characteristic clinical syndrome, hormonal assays with or without provocative stimuli, or radiographic techniques. One approach involves annual screening of individuals at risk with measurement of basal and meal-stimulated levels of pancreatic polypeptide to identify the tumors as early as possible; the rationale for this screening strategy is the concept that surgical removal of islet cell tumors at an early stage will be curative. Other approaches to screening include measurement of serum gastrin and pancreatic polypeptide levels every 2每3 years, with the rationale that pancreatic neoplasms will be detected at a later stage but can be managed medically, if possible, or by surgery. High-resolution, early-phase CT scanning or endoscopic ultrasound provides the best preoperative technique for identification of these tumors; intraoperative ultrasonography is the most sensitive method for detection of small tumors. Although fluorodeoxyglucose每positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scanning detects 50% of pancreatic islet cell tumors, most of these tumors are large; as most of these tumors can be identified by CT or ultrasound, the lack of sensitivity for small tumors makes FDG-PET scanning unhelpful for early diagnosis.

Pituitary tumors occur in 20每30% of patients with MEN 1 and tend to be multicentric. These tumors can exhibit aggressive behavior and local invasiveness that makes them difficult to resect (Chap. 339). Prolactinomas are the most common (Fig. 351-1) and are diagnosed by finding serum prolactin levels >200 g/L with or without a pituitary mass evident on MRI. Values <200 g/L may be due to a prolactin-secreting neoplasm or to compression of the pituitary stalk by a different type of pituitary tumor. Acromegaly due to excessive GH production is the second most common syndrome caused by pituitary tumors in MEN 1 and can rarely be due to production of GHRH by an islet cell tumor (see above). The possibility of hereditary growth hormone每 or prolactin-secreting tumors (discussed below in "Other Genetic Endocrine Tumor Syndromes") should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Cushing's disease can be caused by ACTH-producing pituitary tumors or by ectopic production of ACTH or CRH by other components of the MEN 1 syndrome, including islet cell or carcinoid tumors or adrenal adenomas. Diagnosis of pituitary Cushing's disease is generally best accomplished by a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test or by petrosal venous sinus sampling for ACTH after IV injection of CRH. Differentiation of a primary pituitary tumor from an ectopic CRH-producing tumor may be difficult because the pituitary is the source of ACTH in both disorders; documentation of CRH production by a pancreatic islet or carcinoid tumor may be the only method of proving ectopic CRH production.

Adrenal cortical tumors are found in almost one-half of gene carriers but are rarely functional; malignancy in cortical adenomas is uncommon. Rare cases of pheochromocytoma have been described in the context of MEN 1. Due to their rarity, screening for these tumors is indicated only when there are suggestive symptoms.

Carcinoid tumors in MEN 1 are of the foregut type and are derived from thymus, lung, stomach, or duodenum; they may metastasize or be locally invasive. These tumors usually produce serotonin, calcitonin, or CRH; the typical carcinoid syndrome with flushing, diarrhea, and bronchospasm is rare (Chap. 350). Mediastinal carcinoid tumors (an upper mediastinal mass) are more common in men; bronchial carcinoid tumors are more common in women. Carcinoid tumors are a late manifestation of MEN 1; some reports have emphasized the importance of routine chest CT screening for mediastinal carcinoid tumors because of their high rate of malignant transformation and aggressive behavior.

Unusual Manifestations of MEN 1

Subcutaneous or visceral lipomas and cutaneous leiomyomas also may be present but rarely undergo malignant transformation. Skin angiofibromas or collagenomas are seen in most patients with MEN 1 when carefully sought.
 
Genetic Considerations

MEN1 gene mutations are found in >90% of families with the syndrome (Fig. 351-2). Genetic testing can be performed in individuals at risk for the development of MEN 1 and is commercially available in the United States and Europe. The major value of genetic testing in a kindred with an identifiable mutation is the assignment or exclusion of gene carrier status. In those identified as carrying the mutant gene, routine screening for individual manifestations of MEN 1 should be performed as outlined above. Those with negative genetic test results in a kindred with a known germ-line mutation can be excluded from further screening for MEN 1. A significant percentage of sporadic parathyroid, islet cell, and carcinoid tumors also have loss or mutation of MEN1. There is no correlation between a particular germ-line mutation and a clinical phenotype. It is presumed that these mutations are somatic and occur in a single cell, leading to subsequent transformation.

Treatment: Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1

Almost everyone who inherits a mutant MEN1 gene develops at least one clinical manifestation of the syndrome. Most develop hyperparathyroidism, 80% develop pancreatic islet cell tumors, and more than half develop pituitary tumors. For most of these tumors, initial surgery is not curative and patients frequently require multiple surgical procedures and surgery on two or more endocrine glands during a lifetime. For this reason, it is essential to establish clear goals for management of these patients rather than to recommend surgery casually each time a tumor is discovered. Ranges for acceptable management are discussed below.

Hyperparathyroidism

Individuals with serum calcium levels >3.0 mmol/L (12 mg/dL), evidence of calcium nephrolithiasis or renal dysfunction, neuropathic or muscular symptoms, or bone involvement (including osteopenia) and individuals <50 years of age should undergo parathyroid exploration. There is less agreement about the necessity for parathyroid exploration in individuals who do not meet these criteria, and observation may be appropriate in MEN 1 patients with asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism.

When parathyroid surgery is indicated in MEN 1, there are two approaches. In the first, all parathyroid tissue is identified and removed at the time of primary operation, and parathyroid tissue is implanted in the nondominant forearm. Thymectomy also should be performed because of the potential for later development of malignantcarcinoid tumors. If reoperation for hyperparathyroidism is necessary at a later date, transplanted parathyroid tissue can be resected from the forearm with titration of tissue removal to lower the intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) to <50% of basal.

Another approach is to remove 3每3.5 parathyroid glands from the neck (leaving 50 mg of parathyroid tissue), carefully marking the location of residual tissue so that the remaining tissue can be located easily during subsequent surgery. If this approach is used, intraoperative PTH measurements should be utilized to monitor adequacy of removal of parathyroid tissue with a goal of reducing postoperative serum intact PTH to 50% of basal values.

The use of high-resolution CT scanning (1 mm) and imaging during three phases of contrast flow has substantially improved the ability to identify aberrantly located parathyroid tissue. As this issue arises with some frequency in the context of parathyroid disease in MEN 1, this technique should be utilized to locate parathyroid tissue before reoperation for a failed exploration, and it may be useful before the initial operation.

Pancreatic Islet Cell Tumors

(See Chap. 350 for discussion of pancreatic islet cell tumors not associated with MEN 1.) Two features of pancreatic islet cell tumors in MEN 1 complicate management. First, the tumors are multicentric, are malignant about a third of the time, and cause death in 10每20% of patients. Second, performance of a total pancreatectomy to prevent malignancy causes diabetes mellitus, a disease with significant long-term complications that include neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy. These features make it difficult to formulate clear-cut guidelines, but some general concepts appear to be valid. (1) Islet cell tumors producing insulin, glucagon, VIP, GHRH, or CRH should be resected because medical therapy for the hormonal effects of these tumors are generally ineffective. (2) Gastrin-producing islet cell tumors that cause ZES are frequently multicentric. Recent experience suggests that a high percentage of ZES in MEN 1 is caused by duodenal wall carcinoid tumors and that resection of these tumors improves the cure rate. Treatment with H2 receptor antagonists (cimetidine or ranitidine) or proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, etc.) provides an alternative, and some think preferable, therapy to surgery for control of ulcer disease in patients with multicentric tumors or hepatic metastases. (3) In families in which there is a high incidence of malignant islet cell tumors that cause death, total pancreatectomy at an early age may be considered to prevent malignancy, although it should be noted that this surgical intervention does not prevent the development of neuroendocrine tumors outside the pancreato-duodenal region.

Management of metastatic islet cell carcinoma is unsatisfactory. Hormonal abnormalities sometimes can be controlled. For example, ZES can be treated with H2 receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors; the somatostatin analogues octreotide and lanreotide are useful in the management of carcinoid, glucagonoma, and the watery diarrhea syndrome. Bilateral adrenalectomy may be required for ectopic ACTH syndrome if medical therapy is ineffective (Chap. 342). Islet cell carcinomas frequently metastasize to the liver but may grow slowly. Hepatic artery embolization, radiofrequency ablation, or chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, streptozocin, chlorozotocin, doxorubicin, or dacarbazine) may reduce tumor streptozotocin mass, control symptoms of hormone excess, and prolong life; however, these treatments are never curative. There is evolving evidence that everolimus, an inhibitor of mTor (mammalian target of rapamycin) causes regression of tumor size; 2 of 13 islet cell carcinomas and 2 of 12 carcinoid tumors had a >30% reduction in size and >60% had stable disease.

Pituitary Tumors

Treatment of prolactinomas with dopamine agonists (bromocriptine, cabergoline, or quinagolide) usually returns the serum prolactin level to normal and prevents further tumor growth (Chap. 339). Surgical resection of a prolactinoma is rarely curative but may relieve mass effects. Transsphenoidal resection is appropriate for neoplasms that secrete ACTH, GH, or the  subunit of the pituitary glycoprotein hormones. Octreotide reduces tumor mass in one-third of GH-secreting tumors and reduces GH and insulin-like growth factor I levels in >75% of patients. Pegvisomant, a GH antagonist, rapidly lowers insulin-like growth factor levels in patients with acromegaly (Chap. 339). Radiation therapy may be useful for large or recurrent tumors.

Improvements in the management of MEN 1, particularly the earlier recognition of islet cell and pituitary tumors, have improved outcomes in these patients. As a result, other neoplastic manifestations that develop later in the course of this disorder, such as carcinoid syndrome, are now seen with increased frequency.

Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2

Clinical Manifestations

Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and pheochromocytoma are associated in two major syndromes: MEN type 2A and MEN type 2B (Table 351-1). MEN 2A is the combination of MTC, hyperparathyroidism, and pheochromocytoma. Three subvariants of MEN 2A are familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC), MEN 2A with cutaneous lichen amyloidosis, and MEN 2A with Hirschsprung disease. MEN 2B is the combination of MTC, pheochromocytoma, mucosal neuromas, intestinal ganglioneuromatosis, and marfanoid features.

Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2a

MTC is the most common manifestation. This tumor usually develops in childhood, beginning as hyperplasia of the calcitonin-producing cells (C cells) of the thyroid. MTC typically is located at the junction of the upper one-third and lower two-thirds of each lobe of the thyroid, reflecting the high density of C cells in this location; tumors >1 cm in size frequently are associated with local or distant metastases.

Pheochromocytoma occurs in 50% of patients with MEN 2A and causes palpitations, nervousness, headaches, and sometimes sweating (Chap. 343). About half of the tumors are bilateral, and >50% of patients who have had unilateral adrenalectomy develop a pheochromocytoma in the contralateral gland within a decade. A second feature of these tumors is a disproportionate increase in the secretion of epinephrine relative to norepinephrine. This characteristic differentiates the MEN 2 pheochromocytomas from sporadic pheochromocytoma and those associated with von Hippel每Lindau (VHL) syndrome, hereditary paraganglioma, or neurofibromatosis. Capsular invasion is common, but metastasis is uncommon. Finally, the pheochromocytomas almost always are found in the adrenal gland, differentiating the pheochromocytomas in MEN 2 from the extraadrenal tumors more commonly found in hereditary paraganglioma syndromes.

Hyperparathyroidism occurs in 15每20% of patients, with the peak incidence in the third or fourth decade. The manifestations of hyperparathyroidism do not differ from those in other forms of primary hyperparathyroidism (Chap. 353). Diagnosis is established by finding hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, hypercalciuria, and an inappropriately high serum level of intact PTH. Multiglandular parathyroid hyperplasia is the most common histologic finding, although with long-standing disease adenomatous changes may be superimposed on hyperplasia.

The most common subvariant of MEN 2A is familial MTC, an autosomal dominant syndrome in which MTC is the only manifestation (Table 351-1). The clinical diagnosis of FMTC is established by the identification of MTC in multiple generations without a pheochromocytoma. Since the penetrance of pheochromocytoma is 50% in MEN 2A, it is possible that MEN 2A could masquerade as FMTC in small kindreds. It is important to consider this possibility carefully before classifying a kindred as having FMTC; failure to do so could lead to death or serious morbidity from pheochromocytoma in an affected kindred member. The difficulty of differentiating MEN 2A and FMTC is discussed further below.

Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2b

The association of MTC, pheochromocytoma, mucosal neuromas, and a marfanoid habitus is designated MEN 2B. MTC in MEN 2B develops earlier and is more aggressive than in MEN 2A. Metastatic disease has been described before 1 year of age, and death may occur in the second or third decade of life. However, the prognosis is not invariably bad even in patients with metastatic disease, as evidenced by a number of multigenerational families with this disease.

Pheochromocytoma occurs in more than half of MEN 2B patients and does not differ from that in MEN 2A. Hypercalcemia is rare in MEN 2B, and there are no well-documented examples of hyperparathyroidism.

The mucosal neuromas and marfanoid body habitus are the most distinctive features and are recognizable in childhood. Neuromas are present on the tip of the tongue, under the eyelids, and throughout the gastrointestinal tract and are true neuromas, distinct from neurofibromas. The most common presentation in children relates to gastrointestinal symptomatology, including intermittent colic, pseudoobstruction, and diarrhea.
 
Genetic Considerations

Mutations of the RET protooncogene have been identified in most patients with MEN 2 (Fig. 351-3). RET encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor that in combination with a co-receptor, GFR, normally is activated by glial cell每derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) or other members of this transforming growth factor 每like family of peptides, including artemin, persephin, and neurturin. In the C cell there is evidence that persephin normally activates the RET/GFR-4 receptor complex and is partially responsible for migration of the C cells into the thyroid gland, whereas in the developing neuronal system of the gastrointestinal tract, GDNF activates the RET/GFR-1 complex. RET mutations induce constitutive activity of the receptor, explaining the autosomal dominant transmission of the disorder.

Figure 351-3

 
 
 
Schematic diagram of the RET protooncogene showing mutations found in MEN type 2 and sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). The RET protooncogene is located on the proximal arm of chromosome 10q (10q11.2). Activating mutations of two functional domains of RET tyrosine kinase receptor have been identified. The first affects a cysteine-rich (Cys-Rich) region in the extracellular portion of the receptor. Each germ-line mutation changes a cysteine at codons 609, 611, 618, 620, or 634 to another amino acid. The second region is the intracellular tyrosine kinase (TK) domain. Codon 634 mutations account for 80% of all germ-line mutations. Mutations of codons 630, 768, 883, and 918 have been identified as somatic (non-germ-line) mutations that occur in a single parafollicular or C cell within the thyroid gland in sporadic MTC. A codon 918 mutation is the most common somatic mutation. MEN2, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2; CLA, cutaneous lichen amyloidosis; FMTC, familial medullary thyroid carcinoma; Signal, the signal peptide; Cadherin, a cadherin-like region in the extracellular domain; TM, transmembrane domain; TK, tyrosine kinase domain.
 
 

Naturally occurring mutations localize to two regions of the RET tyrosine kinase receptor. The first is a cysteine-rich extracellular domain; point mutations in the coding sequence for one of six cysteines (codons 609, 611, 618, 620, 630, and 634) cause amino acid substitutions that induce receptor dimerization and activation in the absence of its ligand. Codon 634 mutations occur in 80% of MEN 2A kindreds and are most commonly associated with classic MEN 2A features (Figs. 351-3 and 351-2); an arginine substitution at this codon accounts for half of all MEN 2A mutations. All reported families with MEN 2A and cutaneous lichen amyloidosis have a codon 634 mutation. Mutations of codon 609, 611, 618, or 620 occur in 10每15% of MEN 2A kindreds and are more commonly associated with FMTC (Fig. 351-3). Mutations in codons 609, 618, and 620 also have been identified in a variant of MEN 2A that includes Hirschsprung disease (Fig. 351-3). The second region of the RET tyrosine kinase that is mutated in MEN 2 is in the substrate recognition pocket at codon 918 (Fig. 351-3). This activating mutation is present in 95% of patients with MEN 2B and accounts for 5% of all RET protooncogene mutations in MEN 2. Mutations of codon 883 and 922 also have been identified in a few patients with MEN 2B.

Uncommon mutations (<5% of the total) include those of codons 533 (exon 8), 666, 768, 777, 790, 791, 804, 891, and 912. Mutations associated with only FMTC include codons 533, 768, and 912. With greater experience, mutations that once were associated with FMTC only (666, 791, V804L, V804M, and 891) have been found in MEN 2A as there have been occasional descriptions of pheochromocytoma. At present it is reasonable to conclude that only kindreds with codon 533, 768, or 912 mutations are consistently associated with FMTC; in kindreds with all other RET mutations, pheochromocytoma is a possibility. The recognition that germ-line mutations occur in at least 6% of patients with apparently sporadic MTC has led to the firm recommendation that all patients with MTC should be screened for these mutations. The effort to screen patients with sporadic MTC, combined with the fact that new kindreds with classic MEN 2A are being recognized less frequently, has led to a shift in the mutation frequencies. These findings mirror results in other malignancies in which germ-line mutations of cancer-causing genes contribute to a greater percentage of apparently sporadic cancer than was considered previously. The recognition of new RET mutations suggests that more will be identified in the future.

Somatic mutations (found only in the tumor and not transmitted in the germ line) of the RET protooncogene have been identified in sporadic MTC; 25每60% of sporadic tumors have codon 918 mutations, and somatic mutations in codons 630, 768, and 804 have been identified (Fig. 351-3).

Treatment: Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2


Screening for Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2

Death from MTC can be prevented by early thyroidectomy. The identification of RET protooncogene mutations and the application of DNA-based molecular diagnostic techniques to identify these mutations have simplified the screening process. During the initial evaluation of a kindred, a RET protooncogene analysis should be performed on an individual with proven MEN 2A. Establishment of the specific germ-line mutation facilitates the subsequent analysis of other family members. Each family member at risk should be tested twice for the presence of the specific mutation; the second analysis should be performed on a new DNA sample and, ideally, in a second laboratory to exclude sample mix-up or technical error (see www.genetests.org for an up-to-date list of laboratory testing sites). Both false-positive and false-negative analyses have been described. A false-negative test result is of the greatest concern because calcitonin testing is now rarely performed as a diagnostic backup study; if there is a genetic test error, a child may present in the second or third decade with metastatic MTC. Individuals in a kindred with a known mutation who have two normal analyses can be excluded from further screening.

There is a consensus that children with codon 883, 918, and 922 mutations, those associated with MEN 2B, should have a total thyroidectomy and central lymph node dissection (level VI) performed during the first months of life or soon after identification of the syndrome. If local metastasis is discovered, a more extensive lymph node dissection (levels II to V) is generally indicated. In children with codon 611, 618, 620, 630, 634, and 891 mutations, thyroidectomy should be performed before age 6 years because of reports of local metastatic disease in children this age. Finally, there are kindreds with codon 609, 768, 790, 791, 804, and 912 mutations in which the phenotype of MTC appears to be less aggressive. A clinician caring for children with one of these mutations faces a dilemma. In many kindreds there has never been a death from MTC caused by one of these mutations. However, in other kindreds there are examples of metastatic disease occurring early in life. For example, metastatic disease before age 6 years has been described with codon 609 and 804 mutations and before age 14 years in a patient with a codon 912 mutation. In kindreds with these mutations, two management approaches have been suggested: (1) perform a total thyroidectomy with or without central node dissection at some arbitrary age (perhaps 6每10 years of age) or (2) continue annual or biannual calcitonin provocative testing with performance of total thyroidectomy with or without central neck dissection when the test becomes abnormal. The pentagastrin test involves measurement of serum calcitonin basally and 2, 5, 10, and 15 min after a bolus injection of 5 g pentagastrin per kilogram of body weight. Patients should be warned before pentagastrin injection of epigastric tightness, nausea, warmth, and tingling of extremities and reassured that the symptoms will last 2 min. If pentagastrin is unavailable, an alternative is a short calcium infusion, performed by obtaining a baseline serum calcitonin and then infusing 150 mg calcium salt IV over 10 min with measurement of serum calcitonin at 5, 10, 15, 30 min after initiation of the infusion.

The RET protooncogene analysis should be performed in patients with suspected MEN 2B to detect codon 883, 918, and 922 mutations, especially in newborn children in whom the diagnosis is suspected but the clinical phenotype is not fully developed. Other family members at risk for MEN 2B also should be tested because the mucosal neuromas can be subtle. Most MEN 2B mutations represent de novo mutations derived from the paternal allele. In the rare families with proven germ-line transmission of MTC but no identifiable RET protooncogene mutation (sequencing of the entire RET gene should be performed), annual pentagastrin or calcium testing should be performed on members at risk.

Annual screening for pheochromocytoma in patients with germ-line RET mutations should be performed by measuring basal plasma or 24-h urine catecholamines and metanephrines. The goal is to identify a pheochromocytoma before it causes significant symptoms or is likely to cause sudden death, an event most commonly associated with large tumors. Although there are kindreds with FMTC and specific RET mutations in which no pheochromocytomas have been identified (Fig. 351-3), clinical experience is insufficient to exclude pheochromocytoma screening in these individuals. Radiographic studies such as MRI or CT scans generally are reserved for individuals with abnormal screening tests or symptoms suggestive of pheochromocytoma (Chap. 343). Women should be tested during pregnancy because undetected pheochromocytoma can cause maternal death during childbirth.

Measurement of serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels every 2每3 years provides an adequate screen for hyperparathyroidism, except in families in which hyperparathyroidism is a prominent component, in which measurements should be made annually.

Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma

Hereditary MTC is a multicentric disorder. Total thyroidectomy with a central lymph node dissection should be performed in children who carry the mutant gene. Incomplete thyroidectomy leaves the possibility of later transformation of residual C cells. The goal of early therapy is cure, and a strategy that does not accomplish this goal is shortsighted. Long-term follow-up studies indicate an excellent outcome, with 90% of children free of disease 15每20 years after surgery. In contrast, 15每25% of patients in whom the diagnosis is made on the basis of a palpable thyroid nodule die from the disease within 15每20 years.

In adults with MTC >1 cm in size, metastases to regional lymph nodes are common (>75%). Total thyroidectomy with central lymph node dissection and selective dissection of other regional chains provides the best chance for cure. In patients with extensive local metastatic disease in the neck, external radiation may prevent local recurrence or reduce tumor mass but is not curative. Chemotherapy with combinations of adriamycin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and dacarbazine may provide palliation. Clinical trials with small compounds (tyrosine kinase inhibitors) that interact with the ATP-binding pocket of the RET, vascular endothelial receptor, and type 2 and epidermal growth factor receptors and prevent phosphorylation have shown promise for treatment of hereditary and sporadic MTC. A phase I trial of vandetanib has shown that 45% of patients have a 30% or greater reduction of tumor size and prolongation of progression-free survival by at least 11 months. Similar phase II results have been observed for XL184, sunitinib, tipifarnib, and sorafenib, and phase II trials of E7080 and pazopanib are under way. It seems likely that one or more of these compounds will be approved for treatment of metastatic MTC within the next few years.

Pheochromocytoma

The long-term goal for management of pheochromocytoma is to prevent death and cardiovascular complications. Improvements in radiographic imaging of the adrenals make direct examination of the apparently normal contralateral gland during surgery less important, and the rapid evolution of laparoscopic abdominal or retroperitoneal surgery has simplified management of early pheochromocytoma. The major question is whether to remove both adrenal glands or remove only the affected adrenal at the time of primary surgery. Issues to be considered in making this decision include the possibility of malignancy (<15 reported cases), the high probability of developing pheochromocytoma in the apparently unaffected gland over an 8- to 10-year period, and the risks of adrenal insufficiency caused by removal of both glands (at least two deaths related to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in MEN 2 patients). Most clinicians recommend removing only the affected gland. If both adrenals are removed, glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement is mandatory. An alternative approach is to perform a cortical-sparing adrenalectomy, removing the pheochromocytoma and adrenal medulla and leaving the adrenal cortex behind. This approach is usually successful and eliminates the necessity for steroid hormone replacement in most patients, although the pheochromocytoma recurs in a small percentage.

Hyperparathyroidism

Hyperparathyroidism has been managed by one of two approaches. Removal of 3.5 glands with maintenance of the remaining half gland in the neck is the usual procedure. In families in which hyperparathyroidism is a prominent manifestation (almost always associated with a codon 634 RET mutation) and recurrence is common, total parathyroidectomy with transplantation of parathyroid tissue into the nondominant forearm is preferred. This approach is discussed above in the context of hyperparathyroidism associated with MEN 1.

Other Genetic Endocrine Tumor Syndromes

A number of mixed syndromes exist in which the neoplastic associations differ from those in MEN 1 or 2 (Table 351-1).

The cause of VHL syndrome〞the association of central nervous system tumors, renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and islet cell neoplasms〞is a mutation in the VHL tumor-suppressor gene. Germ-line-inactivating mutations of the VHL gene cause tumor formation when there is additional loss or somatic mutation of the normal VHL allele in brain, kidney, pancreatic islet, or adrenal medullary cells. Missense mutations been identified in >40% of VHL families with pheochromocytoma, suggesting that families with this type of mutation should be surveyed routinely for pheochromocytoma. A point that may be useful in differentiating VHL from MEN 1 (overlapping features include islet cell tumor and rare pheochromocytoma) or MEN 2 (overlapping feature is pheochromocytoma) is that hyperparathyroidism rarely occurs in VHL.

The molecular defect in type 1 neurofibromatosis inactivates neurofibromin, a cell membrane每associated protein that normally activates a GTPase. Inactivation of this protein impairs GTPase and causes continuous activation of p21 Ras and its downstream tyrosine kinase pathway. Endocrine tumors also form in less common neoplastic genetic syndromes. These include Cowden disease, Carney complex, familial growth hormone and prolactin tumors, and familial carcinoid syndrome. Carney complex includes myxomas of the heart, skin, and breast; peripheral nerve schwannomas; spotty skin pigmentation; and testicular, adrenal, and GH-secreting pituitary tumors. Linkage analysis has identified two loci: chromosome 2p in half of the families and 17q in the others. The 17q gene has been identified as the regulatory subunit (type IA) of protein kinase A (PRKA1A). Familial growth hormone每 or prolactin-producing neoplasms without other manifestations of MEN 1 are caused by germ-line-inactivating mutation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP). It is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner. Other types of endocrine tumors have not, to date, been associated with AIP mutations.
 
Immunologic Syndromes Affecting Multiple Endocrine Organs

When immune dysfunction affects two or more endocrine glands and other nonendocrine immune disorders are present, the polyglandular autoimmune (PGA) syndromes should be considered. The PGA syndromes are classified as two main types: the type I syndrome starts in childhood and is characterized by mucocutaneous candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency; the type II, or Schmidt, syndrome is more likely to present in adults and most commonly includes adrenal insufficiency, thyroiditis, or type 1 diabetes mellitus. Some authors have attempted to subdivide PGA II on the basis of association with some autoimmune disorders but not others (i.e., type II and type III). The type III syndrome is heterogeneous and may consist of autoimmune thyroid disease along with a variety of other autoimmune endocrine disorders (Table 351-2). However, little information is gained by making this subdivision in terms of understanding pathogenesis or prevention of future endocrine complications in individual patients or in the affected families.

Polyglandular Autoimmune Syndrome Type I

PGA type I usually is recognized in the first decade of life and requires two of three components for diagnosis: mucocutaneous candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency. Mucocutaneous candidiasis and hypoparathyroidism present with similar high frequency (100% and 79每96%, respectively). Adrenal insufficiency is observed in 60每72% of patients. Mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids may be lost simultaneously or sequentially. PGA type 1 also is called autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED). Other endocrine defects can include gonadal failure (60% female, 14% male), hypothyroidism (5%), and destruction of the beta cells of the pancreatic islets and development of insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus (14% lifetime risk). Additional features include hypoplasia of the dental enamel, nail dystrophy, tympanic membrane sclerosis, vitiligo, keratopathy, and gastric parietal cell dysfunction resulting in pernicious anemia (13%). Some patients develop autoimmune hepatitis (12%), malabsorption (variably attributed to intestinal lymphangiectasia, bacterial overgrowth, or hypoparathyroidism), asplenism, achalasia, and cholelithiasis (Table 351-2). At the outset, only one organ may be involved, but the number increases with time so that patients eventually manifest two to five components of the syndrome.

Most patients initially present with oral candidiasis in childhood; it is poorly responsive to treatment (Chap. 353) and relapses frequently. Chronic hypoparathyroidism usually occurs before adrenal insufficiency develops. More than 60% of postpubertal women develop premature hypogonadism. The endocrine components, including adrenal insufficiency and hypoparathyroidism, may not develop until the fourth decade, making continued surveillance necessary.

Type I PGA syndrome is not associated with a particular HLA type and usually is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. It may occur sporadically. The responsible gene, designated as either APECED or AIRE, encodes a transcription factor that is expressed in thymus and lymph nodes; a variety of different mutations have been reported. The mechanism by which these mutations lead to the diverse manifestations of type I PGA is unknown.

Polyglandular Autoimmune Syndrome Type II

PGA type II is characterized by two or more of the endocrinopathies listed in Table 351-2. Most often these endocrinopathies include primary adrenal insufficiency, Graves' disease or autoimmune hypothyroidism, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and primary hypogonadism. Because adrenal insufficiency is relatively rare, it is used frequently to define the presence of the syndrome. Among patients with adrenal insufficiency, type 1 diabetes mellitus coexists in 52% and autoimmune thyroid disease occurs in 69%. However, many patients with antimicrosomal and antithyroglobulin antibodies never develop abnormalities of thyroid function. Thus, increased antibody titers alone are poor predictors of future disease. Other associated conditions include hypophysitis, celiac disease (2每3%), atrophic gastritis, and pernicious anemia (13%). Vitiligo, which is caused by antibodies against the melanocyte, and alopecia are less common than in the type I syndrome. Mucocutaneous candidiasis does not occur. A few patients develop a late-onset, usually transient hypoparathyroidism caused by antibodies that compete with PTH for binding to the PTH receptor. Up to 25% of patients with myasthenia gravis and an even higher percentage who have myasthenia and a thymoma have PGA type II.

The type II syndrome is familial in nature, often transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance. As in many of the individual autoimmune endocrinopathies, certain HL-DR3 and -DR4 alleles increase disease susceptibility; several different genes probably contribute to the expression of this syndrome.

A variety of autoantibodies are seen in PGA type II, including antibodies directed against (1) thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin, and the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor; (2) adrenal side chain cleavage enzyme, steroid 21-hydroxylase, or ACTH receptor; and (3) pancreatic islet glutamic acid decarboxylase or the insulin receptor, among others. The roles of cytokines such as interferon and cell-mediated immunity are unclear.

Diagnosis

The clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency often develop slowly, may be difficult to detect, and can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated appropriately. Thus, prospective screening should be performed routinely in all patients and family members at risk for PGA types I and II. The most effective screening test for adrenal disease is a cosyntropin stimulation test (Chap. 342). A fasting blood glucose level can be obtained to screen for hyperglycemia. Additional screening tests should include measurements of TSH, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and, in men, testosterone levels. In families with suspected type I PGA syndrome, calcium and phosphorus levels should be measured. These screening studies should be performed every 1每2 years up to about age 50 in families with PGA type II syndrome and until about age 40 in patients with type I syndrome. Screening measurements of autoantibodies against potentially affected endocrine organs are of uncertain prognostic value. The differential diagnosis of PGA syndrome should include the DiGeorge syndrome (hypoparathyroidism due to glandular agenesis and mucocutaneous candidiasis), Kearns-Sayre syndrome (hypoparathyroidism, primary hypogonadism, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and panhypopituitarism), Wolfram's syndrome (congenital diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus), IPEX syndrome (immunodysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, and enteropathy, X-linked), and congenital rubella (type 1 diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism).

Treatment: Polyglandular Autoimmune Syndrome

With the exception of Graves' disease, the management of each of the endocrine components of the disease involves hormone replacement and is covered in detail in the chapters on adrenal, thyroid, gonadal, and parathyroid disease (Chaps. 341, 342, 346, 347, and 353). Some aspects of therapy merit special emphasis. Primary hypothyroidism can mask adrenal insufficiency by prolonging the half-life of cortisol; consequently, administration of thyroid hormone to a patient with unsuspected adrenal insufficiency can precipitate adrenal crisis. Thus, all patients with hypothyroidism in the context of PGA syndrome should be screened for adrenal disease and, if it is present, treated with glucocorticoids before or concurrently with thyroid hormone therapy. Hypoglycemia or decreasing insulin requirements in a patient with diabetes mellitus type 1 may be the earliest symptom of adrenal insufficiency. Consequently, such patients should be screened for adrenal disease. Treatment of mucocutaneous candidiasis with ketoconazole may induce adrenal insufficiency. This drug also may elevate liver enzymes, making the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis more difficult. Hypocalcemia in PGA type II is more commonly due to malabsorption associated with celiac disease than to hypoparathyroidism.

Other Autoimmune Endocrine Syndromes

Insulin Resistance Caused by Antibodies

Rare insulin-resistance syndromes occur in patients who develop antibodies that block the interaction of insulin with its receptor. Conversely, other classes of anti-insulin receptor antibodies can activate the receptor and can cause hypoglycemia; this disorder should be considered in the differential diagnosis of fasting hypoglycemia (Chap. 345).

Patients with insulin receptor antibodies and acanthosis nigricans are often middle-aged women who acquire insulin resistance in association with other autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Sj?gren's syndrome. Vitiligo, alopecia, Raynaud's phenomenon, and arthritis also may be seen. Other autoimmune endocrine disorders, including thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism, and hypogonadism, occur rarely. Acanthosis nigricans, a velvety, hyperpigmented, thickened skin lesion, is prominent on the dorsum of the neck and other skinfold areas in the axillae or groin and often heralds the diagnosis in these patients. However, acanthosis nigricans also occurs in patients with obesity or polycystic ovarian syndrome, in which insulin resistance appears to be due to a postreceptor defect; thus, acanthosis nigricans itself is not diagnostic of the immunologic form of insulin resistance.

Some patients with acanthosis nigricans have mild glucose intolerance, with a compensatory increase in insulin secretion that is detected only when insulin levels are measured. Others have severe diabetes mellitus that requires massive doses of insulin (several thousand units per day) to lower the blood glucose levels. The nature of the antibodies determines the manifestations; though insulin resistance is more common, fasting hypoglycemia can result from insulinomimetic antibodies.

Insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus associated with anti-insulin antibodies occurs in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia. This is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in ATM, a gene involved in cellular responses to ionizing radiation and oxidative damage. This disorder is characterized by ataxia, telangiectasia, immune abnormalities, and an increased incidence of malignancies.

Autoimmune Insulin Syndrome with Hypoglycemia

This disorder typically occurs in patients with other autoimmune disorders and is caused by polyclonal autoantibodies that bind to endogenously synthesized insulin. If the insulin dissociates from the antibodies several hours or more after a meal, hypoglycemia can result. Most cases of the syndrome have been described from Japan, and there may be a genetic component. In plasma cell dyscrasias such as multiple myeloma, the plasma cells may produce monoclonal antibodies against insulin and cause hypoglycemia by a similar mechanism.

Antithyroxine Antibodies and Hypothyroidism

Circulating autoantibodies against thyroid hormones in patients with both immune thyroid disease and plasma cell dyscrasias such as Waldenstr?m's macroglobulinemia can bind thyroid hormones, decrease their biologic activity, and result in primary hypothyroidism. In other patients the antibodies simply interfere with thyroid hormone immunoassays and cause false elevations or decreases in measured hormone levels.

Crow-Fukase Syndrome

The features of this syndrome are highlighted by an acronym that emphasizes its important features: polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-proteins, and skin changes (POEMS). The most important feature is a severe, progressive sensorimotor polyneuropathy associated with a plasma cell dyscrasia. Localized collections of plasma cells (plasmacytomas) can cause sclerotic bone lesions and produce monoclonal IgG or IgA proteins. Endocrine manifestations in men or women include hyperprolactinemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, primary hypothyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency. Additional findings include ovarian failure and amenorrhea in women and testicular failure, impotence, and gynecomastia in men. Skin changes include hyperpigmentation, thickening of the dermis, hirsutism, and hyperhidrosis. Hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy occur in about two-thirds of patients, and splenomegaly is seen in about one-third. Other manifestations include increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure with papilledema, peripheral edema, ascites, pleural effusions, glomerulonephritis, and fever. Median survival may be >10 years, though shorter in patients with extravascular volume overload or clubbing.

The systemic nature of the disorder may cause confusion with other connective tissue diseases. The endocrine manifestations suggest an autoimmune basis of the disorder, but circulating antibodies against endocrine cells have not been demonstrated. Increased serum and tissue levels of interleukin 6, interleukin 1, vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloproteins, and tumor necrosis factor  are present, but the pathophysiologic basis for the POEMS syndrome is uncertain. Therapy directed against the plasma cell dyscrasia such as local radiation of bony lesions, chemotherapy, thalidomide, plasmapheresis, bone marrow or stem cell transplantation, and treatment with all-trans retinoic acid may improve the endocrine manifestations.

 Chapter 352. Bone and Mineral Metabolism in Health and Disease >
 

Bone Structure and Metabolism

Bone is a dynamic tissue that is remodeled constantly throughout life. The arrangement of compact and cancellous bone provides strength and density suitable for both mobility and protection. In addition, bone provides a reservoir for calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, sodium, and other ions necessary for homeostatic functions. Bone also hosts and regulates hematopoiesis by providing niches for hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation. The skeleton is highly vascular and receives about 10% of the cardiac output. Remodeling of bone is accomplished by two distinct cell types: osteoblasts produce bone matrix, and osteoclasts resorb the matrix.

The extracellular components of bone consist of a solid mineral phase in close association with an organic matrix, of which 90每95% is type I collagen (Chap. 363). The noncollagenous portion of the organic matrix is heterogeneous and contains serum proteins such as albumin as well as many locally produced proteins, whose functions are incompletely understood. Those proteins include cell attachment/signaling proteins such as thrombospondin, osteopontin, and fibronectin; calcium-binding proteins such as matrix gla protein and osteocalcin; and proteoglycans such as biglycan and decorin. Some of the proteins organize collagen fibrils; others influence mineralization and binding of the mineral phase to the matrix.

The mineral phase is made up of calcium and phosphate and is best characterized as a poorly crystalline hydroxyapatite. The mineral phase of bone is deposited initially in intimate relation to the collagen fibrils and is found in specific locations in the "holes" between the collagen fibrils. This architectural arrangement of mineral and matrix results in a two-phase material well suited to withstand mechanical stresses. The organization of collagen influences the amount and type of mineral phase formed in bone. Although the primary structures of type I collagen in skin and bone tissues are similar, there are differences in posttranslational modifications and distribution of intermolecular cross-links. The holes in the packing structure of the collagen are larger in mineralized collagen of bone and dentin than in unmineralized collagens such as those in tendon. Single amino acid substitutions in the helical portion of either the 汐1 (COL1A1) or 汐2 (COL1A2) chains of type I collagen disrupt the organization of bone in osteogenesis imperfecta. The severe skeletal fragility associated with this group of disorders highlights the importance of the fibrillar matrix in the structure of bone (Chap. 363).

Osteoblasts synthesize and secrete the organic matrix. They are derived from cells of mesenchymal origin (Fig. 352-1A). Active osteoblasts are found on the surface of newly forming bone. As an osteoblast secretes matrix, which then is mineralized, the cell becomes an osteocyte, still connected with its blood supply through a series of canaliculi. Osteocytes account for the vast majority of the cells in bone. They are thought to be the mechanosensors in bone that communicate signals to surface osteoblasts and their progenitors through the canalicular network and thereby serve as master regulators of bone formation and resorption. Remarkably, osteocytes also secrete fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a major regulator of phosphate metabolism (see below). Mineralization of the matrix, both in trabecular bone and in osteones of compact cortical bone (Haversian systems), begins soon after the matrix is secreted (primary mineralization) but is not completed for several weeks or even longer (secondary mineralization). Although this mineralization takes advantage of the high concentrations of calcium and phosphate, already near saturation in serum, mineralization is a carefully regulated process that is dependent on the activity of osteoblast-derived alkaline phosphatase, which probably works by hydrolyzing inhibitors of mineralization.

Genetic studies in humans and mice have identified several key genes that control osteoblast development. Runx2 is a transcription factor expressed specifically in chondrocyte (cartilage cells) and osteoblast progenitors as well as in hypertrophic chondrocytes and mature osteoblasts. Runx2 regulates the expression of several important osteoblast proteins, including osterix (another transcription factor needed for osteoblast maturation), osteopontin, bone sialoprotein, type I collagen, osteocalcin, and receptor-activator of NFB (RANK) ligand. Runx2 expression is regulated in part by bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs). Runx2-deficient mice are devoid of osteoblasts, whereas mice with a deletion of only one allele (Runx2 +/?) exhibit a delay in formation of the clavicles and some cranial bones. The latter abnormalities are similar to those in the human disorder cleidocranial dysplasia, which is also caused by heterozygous inactivating mutations in Runx2.

The paracrine signaling molecule, Indian hedgehog (Ihh), also plays a critical role in osteoblast development, as evidenced by Ihh-deficient mice that lack osteoblasts in bone formed on a cartilage mold (endochondral ossification). Signals originating from members of the wnt (wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus integration site) family of paracrine factors are also important for osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. Numerous other growth-regulatory factors affect osteoblast function, including the three closely related transforming growth factor 汕s, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) 2 and 18, platelet-derived growth factor, and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) I and II. Hormones such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] activate receptors expressed by osteoblasts to assure mineral homeostasis and influence a variety of bone cell functions.

Resorption of bone is carried out mainly by osteoclasts, multinucleated cells that are formed by fusion of cells derived from the common precursor of macrophages and osteoclasts. Multiple factors that regulate osteoclast development have been identified (Fig. 352-1B). Factors produced by osteoblasts or marrow stromal cells allow osteoblasts to control osteoclast development and activity. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) plays a critical role during several steps in the pathway and ultimately leads to fusion of osteoclast progenitor cells to form multinucleated, active osteoclasts. RANK ligand, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family, is expressed on the surface of osteoblast progenitors and stromal fibroblasts. In a process involving cell-cell interactions, RANK ligand binds to the RANK receptor on osteoclast progenitors, stimulating osteoclast differentiation and activation. Alternatively, a soluble decoy receptor, referred to as osteoprotegerin, can bind RANK ligand and inhibit osteoclast differentiation. Several growth factors and cytokines (including interleukins 1, 6, and 11; TNF; and interferon ) modulate osteoclast differentiation and function. Most hormones that influence osteoclast function do not target these cells directly but instead influence M-CSF and RANK ligand signaling by osteoblasts. Both PTH and 1,25(OH)2D increase osteoclast number and activity, whereas estrogen decreases osteoclast number and activity by this indirect mechanism. Calcitonin, in contrast, binds to its receptor on the basal surface of osteoclasts and directly inhibits osteoclast function.

Osteoclast-mediated resorption of bone takes place in scalloped spaces (Howship's lacunae) where the osteoclasts are attached through a specific 汐v汕3 integrin to components of the bone matrix such as osteopontin. The osteoclast forms a tight seal to the underlying matrix and secretes protons, chloride, and proteinases into a confined space that has been likened to an extracellular lysosome. The active osteoclast surface forms a ruffled border that contains a specialized proton-pump ATPase, which secretes acid and solubilizes the mineral phase. Carbonic anhydrase (type II isoenzyme) within the osteoclast generates the needed protons. The bone matrix is resorbed in the acid environment adjacent to the ruffled border by proteases that act at low pH such as cathepsin K.

In the embryo and the growing child, bone develops by remodeling and replacing previously calcified cartilage (endochondral bone formation) or is formed without a cartilage matrix (intramembranous bone formation). During endochondral bone formation, chondrocytes proliferate, secrete and mineralize a matrix, enlarge (hypertrophy), and then die, enlarging bone and providing the matrix and factors that stimulate endochondral bone formation. This program is regulated by both local factors such as IGF-I and -II, Ihh, parathyroid hormone每related peptide (PTHrP), and FGFs and by systemic hormones such as growth hormone, glucocorticoids, and estrogen.

New bone, whether formed in infants or in adults during repair, has a relatively high ratio of cells to matrix and is characterized by coarse fiber bundles of collagen that are interlaced and randomly dispersed (woven bone). In adults, the more mature bone is organized with fiber bundles regularly arranged in parallel or concentric sheets (lamellar bone). In long bones, deposition of lamellar bone in a concentric arrangement around blood vessels forms the Haversian systems. Growth in length of bones is dependent on proliferation of cartilage cells and the endochondral sequence at the growth plate. Growth in width and thickness is accomplished by formation of bone at the periosteal surface and by resorption at the endosteal surface, with the rate of formation exceeding that of resorption. In adults, after the growth plates close, growth in length and endochondral bone formation cease except for some activity in the cartilage cells beneath the articular surface. Even in adults, however, remodeling of bone (within Haversian systems as well as along the surfaces of trabecular bone) continues throughout life. In adults, ‵4% of the surface of trabecular bone (such as iliac crest) is involved in active resorption, whereas 10每15% of trabecular surfaces are covered with osteoid, unmineralized new bone formed by osteoblasts. Radioisotope studies indicate that as much as 18% of the total skeletal calcium is deposited and removed each year. Thus, bone is an active metabolizing tissue that requires an intact blood supply. The cycle of bone resorption and formation is a highly orchestrated process carried out by the basic multicellular unit, which is composed of a group of osteoclasts and osteoblasts (Fig. 352-2).

Figure 352-2

 
 
 
Schematic representation of bone remodeling. The cycle of bone remodeling is carried out by the basic multicellular unit (BMU), which consists of a group of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. In cortical bone, the BMUs tunnel through the tissue, whereas in cancellous bone, they move across the trabecular surface. The process of bone remodeling is initiated by contraction of the lining cells and the recruitment of osteoclast precursors. These precursors fuse to form multinucleated, active osteoclasts that mediate bone resorption. Osteoclasts adhere to bone and subsequently remove it by acidification and proteolytic digestion. As the BMU advances, osteoclasts leave the resorption site and osteoblasts move in to cover the excavated area and begin the process of new bone formation by secreting osteoid, which eventually is mineralized into new bone. After osteoid mineralization, osteoblasts flatten and form a layer of lining cells over new bone.
 
 

The response of bone to fractures, infection, and interruption of blood supply and to expanding lesions is relatively limited. Dead bone must be resorbed, and new bone must be formed, a process carried out in association with growth of new blood vessels into the involved area. In injuries that disrupt the organization of the tissue such as a fracture in which apposition of fragments is poor or when motion exists at the fracture site, the progenitor stromal cells recapitulate the endochondral bone formation of early development and form cartilage that is replaced by bone and, variably, fibrous tissue. When there is good apposition with fixation and little motion at the fracture site, repair occurs predominantly by formation of new bone without other mediating tissue.

Remodeling of bone occurs along lines of force generated by mechanical stress. The signals from these mechanical stresses are sensed by osteocytes, which transmit signals to osteoclasts and osteoblasts or their precursors. One such signal is sclerostin, an inhibitor of wnt signaling. Mechanical forces suppress sclerostin production and thus increase bone formation by osteoblasts. Expanding lesions in bone such as tumors induce resorption at the surface in contact with the tumor by producing ligands such as PTHrP that stimulate osteoclast differentiation and function. Even in a disorder as architecturally disruptive as Paget's disease, remodeling is dictated by mechanical forces. Thus, bone plasticity reflects the interaction of cells with each other and with the environment.

Measurement of the products of osteoblast and osteoclast activity can assist in the diagnosis and management of bone diseases. Osteoblast activity can be assessed by measuring serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase. Similarly, osteocalcin, a protein secreted from osteoblasts, is made virtually only by osteoblasts. Osteoclast activity can be assessed by measurement of products of collagen degradation. Collagen molecules are covalently linked to each other in the extracellular matrix through the formation of hydroxypyridinium cross-links (Chap. 363). After digestion by osteoclasts, these cross-linked peptides can be measured both in urine and in blood.
 
Calcium Metabolism

Over 99% of the 1每2 kg of calcium present normally in the adult human body resides in the skeleton, where it provides mechanical stability and serves as a reservoir sometimes needed to maintain extracellular fluid (ECF) calcium concentration (Fig. 352-3). Skeletal calcium accretion first becomes significant during the third trimester of fetal life, accelerates throughout childhood and adolescence, reaches a peak in early adulthood, and gradually declines thereafter at rates that rarely exceed 1每2% per year. These slow changes in total skeletal calcium content contrast with relatively high daily rates of closely matched fluxes of calcium into and out of bone (‵250每500 mg each), a process mediated by coupled osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity. Another 0.5每1% of skeletal calcium is freely exchangeable (e.g., in chemical equilibrium) with that in the ECF.

Schematic illustration of calcium content of extracellular fluid (ECF) and bone as well as of diet and feces; magnitude of calcium flux per day as calculated by various methods is shown at sites of transport in intestine, kidney, and bone. Ranges of values shown are approximate and were chosen to illustrate certain points discussed in the text. In conditions of calcium balance, rates of calcium release from and uptake into bone are equal.
 
 

The concentration of ionized calcium in the ECF must be maintained within a narrow range because of the critical role it plays in a wide array of cellular functions, especially those involved in neuromuscular activity, secretion, and signal transduction. Intracellular cytosolic free calcium levels are ‵100 nmol/L and are 10,000-fold lower than ionized calcium concentration in the blood and ECF (1.1每1.3 mmol/L). Cytosolic calcium does not play the structural role played by extracellular calcium; instead, it serves a signaling function. The steep chemical gradient of calcium from outside to inside the cell promotes rapid calcium influx through various membrane calcium channels that can be activated by hormones, metabolites, or neurotransmitters, swiftly changing cellular function. In blood, total calcium concentration is normally 2.2每2.6 mM (8.5每10.5 mg/dL), of which ‵50% is ionized. The remainder is bound ionically to negatively charged proteins (predominantly albumin and immunoglobulins) or loosely complexed with phosphate, citrate, sulfate, or other anions. Alterations in serum protein concentrations directly affect the total blood calcium concentration even if the ionized calcium concentration remains normal. An algorithm to correct for protein changes adjusts the total serum calcium (in mg/dL) upward by 0.8 times the deficit in serum albumin (g/dL) or by 0.5 times the deficit in serum immunoglobulin (in g/dL). Such corrections provide only rough approximations of actual free calcium concentrations, however, and may be misleading, particularly during acute illness. Acidosis also alters ionized calcium by reducing its association with proteins. The best practice is to measure blood ionized calcium directly by a method that employs calcium-selective electrodes in acute settings during which calcium abnormalities might occur.

Control of the ionized calcium concentration in the ECF ordinarily is accomplished by adjusting the rates of calcium movement across intestinal and renal epithelia. These adjustments are mediated mainly via changes in blood levels of the hormones PTH and 1,25(OH)2D. Blood ionized calcium directly suppresses PTH secretion by activating parathyroid calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs). Also, ionized calcium indirectly affects PTH secretion via effects on 1,25(OH)2D production. This active vitamin D metabolite inhibits PTH production by an incompletely understood mechanism of negative feedback (Chap. 353).

Normal dietary calcium intake in the United States varies widely, ranging from 10每37 mmol/d (400每1500 mg/d). Many individuals, in an effort to prevent osteoporosis, routinely supplement this with oral calcium salts to a total intake of 37每50 mmol/d (1500每2000 mg/d). Intestinal absorption of ingested calcium involves both active (transcellular) and passive (paracellular) mechanisms. Passive calcium absorption is nonsaturable and approximates 5% of daily calcium intake, whereas active absorption involves apical calcium entry via specific ion channels (TRPV5 and TRPV6), whose expression is controlled principally by 1,25(OH)2D, and normally ranges from 20 to 70%. Active calcium transport occurs mainly in the proximal small bowel (duodenum and proximal jejunum), although some active calcium absorption occurs in most segments of the small intestine. Optimal rates of calcium absorption require gastric acid. This is especially true for weakly dissociable calcium supplements such as calcium carbonate. In fact, large boluses of calcium carbonate are poorly absorbed because of their neutralizing effect on gastric acid. In achlorhydric subjects and for those taking drugs that inhibit gastric acid secretion, supplements should be taken with meals to optimize their absorption. Use of calcium citrate may be preferable in these circumstances. Calcium absorption may also be blunted in disease states such as pancreatic or biliary insufficiency, in which ingested calcium remains bound to unabsorbed fatty acids or other food constituents. At high levels of calcium intake, synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D is reduced; this decreases the rate of active intestinal calcium absorption. The opposite occurs with dietary calcium restriction. Some calcium, ‵2.5每5 mmol/d (100每200 mg/d), is excreted as an obligate component of intestinal secretions and is not regulated by calciotropic hormones.

The feedback-controlled hormonal regulation of intestinal absorptive efficiency results in a relatively constant daily net calcium absorption of ‵5每7.5 mmol/d (200每400 mg/d) despite large changes in daily dietary calcium intake. This daily load of absorbed calcium is excreted by the kidneys in a manner that is also tightly regulated by the concentration of ionized calcium in the blood. Approximately 8每10 g/d of calcium is filtered by the glomeruli, of which only 2每3% appears in the urine. Most filtered calcium (65%) is reabsorbed in the proximal tubules via a passive, paracellular route that is coupled to concomitant NaCl reabsorption and not specifically regulated. The cortical thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (cTAL) reabsorbs roughly another 20% of filtered calcium, also via a paracellular mechanism. Calcium reabsorption in the cTAL requires a tight-junctional protein called paracellin-1 and is inhibited by increased blood concentrations of calcium or magnesium, acting via the CaSR, which is highly expressed on basolateral membranes in this nephron segment. Operation of the renal CaSR provides a mechanism, independent of those engaged directly by PTH or 1,25(OH)2D, by which serum ionized calcium can control renal calcium reabsorption. Finally, ‵10% of filtered calcium is reabsorbed in the distal convoluted tubules (DCTs) by a transcellular mechanism. Calcium enters the luminal surface of the cell through specific apical calcium channels (TRPV5), whose number is regulated. It then moves across the cell in association with a specific calcium-binding protein (calbindin-D28k) that buffers cytosolic calcium concentrations from the large mass of transported calcium. Ca2+-ATPases and Na+/Ca2+ exchangers actively extrude calcium across the basolateral surface and thereby maintain the transcellular calcium gradient. All these processes are stimulated directly or indirectly by PTH. The DCT is also the site of action of thiazide diuretics, which lower urinary calcium excretion by inducing sodium depletion and thereby augmenting proximal calcium reabsorption. Conversely, dietary sodium loads, or increased distal sodium delivery caused by loop diuretics or saline infusion, induce calciuresis.

The homeostatic mechanisms that normally maintain a constant serum ionized calcium concentration may fail at extremes of calcium intake or when the hormonal systems or organs involved are compromised. Thus, even with maximal activity of the vitamin D每dependent intestinal active transport system, sustained calcium intakes <5 mmol/d (<200 mg/d) cannot provide enough net calcium absorption to replace obligate losses via the intestine, the kidney, sweat, and other secretions. In this case, increased blood levels of PTH and 1,25(OH)2D activate osteoclastic bone resorption to obtain needed calcium from bone, which leads to progressive bone loss and negative calcium balance. Increased PTH and 1,25(OH)2D also enhance renal calcium reabsorption, and 1,25(OH)2D enhances calcium absorption in the gut. At very high calcium intakes [>100 mmol/d (>4 g/d)], passive intestinal absorption continues to deliver calcium into the ECF despite maximally downregulated intestinal active transport and renal tubular calcium reabsorption. This can cause severe hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, progressive renal failure, and hypercalcemia (e.g., "milk-alkali syndrome"). Deficiency or excess of PTH or vitamin D, intestinal disease, and renal failure represent other commonly encountered challenges to normal calcium homeostasis (Chap. 353).
 
Phosphorus Metabolism

Although 85% of the ‵600 g of body phosphorus is present in bone mineral, phosphorus is also a major intracellular constituent both as the free anion(s) and as a component of numerous organophosphate compounds, including structural proteins, enzymes, transcription factors, carbohydrate and lipid intermediates, high-energy stores [ATP (adenosine triphosphate), creatine phosphate], and nucleic acids. Unlike calcium, phosphorus exists intracellularly at concentrations close to those present in ECF (e.g., 1每2 mmol/L). In cells and in the ECF, phosphorus exists in several forms, predominantly as H2PO4? or NaHPO4?, with perhaps 10% as HPO42?. This mixture of anions will be referred to here as "phosphate." In serum, about 12% of phosphorus is bound to proteins. Concentrations of phosphates in blood and ECF generally are expressed in terms of elemental phosphorus, with the normal range in adults being 0.75每1.45 mmol/L (2.5每4.5 mg/dL). Because the volume of the intracellular fluid compartment is twice that of the ECF, measurements of ECF phosphate may not accurately reflect phosphate availability within cells that follows even modest shifts of phosphate from one compartment to the other.

Phosphate is widely available in foods and is absorbed efficiently (65%) by the small intestine even in the absence of vitamin D. However, phosphate absorptive efficiency may be enhanced (to 85每90%) via active transport mechanisms that are stimulated by 1,25(OH)2D. These mechanisms involve activation of Na+/PO42? co-transporters that move phosphate into intestinal cells against an unfavorable electrochemical gradient. Daily net intestinal phosphate absorption varies widely with the composition of the diet but is generally in the range of 500每1000 mg/d. Phosphate absorption can be inhibited by large doses of calcium salts or by sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel), strategies commonly used to control levels of serum phosphate in renal failure. Aluminum hydroxide antacids also reduce phosphate absorption but are used less commonly because of the potential for aluminum toxicity. Low serum phosphate stimulates renal proximal tubular synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D, perhaps by suppressing blood levels of FGF23 (see below).

Serum phosphate levels vary by as much as 50% on a normal day. This reflects the effect of food intake but also an underlying circadian rhythm that produces a nadir between 7 and 10 a.m. Carbohydrate administration, especially as IV dextrose solutions in fasting subjects, can decrease serum phosphate by >0.7 mmol/L (2 mg/dL) due to rapid uptake into and utilization by cells. A similar response is observed in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis and during metabolic or respiratory alkalosis. Because of this wide variation in serum phosphate, it is best to perform measurements in the basal, fasting state.

Control of serum phosphate is determined mainly by the rate of renal tubular reabsorption of the filtered load, which is ‵4每6 g/d. Because intestinal phosphate absorption is highly efficient, urinary excretion is not constant but varies directly with dietary intake. The fractional excretion of phosphate (ratio of phosphate to creatinine clearance) is generally in the range of 10每15%. The proximal tubule is the principal site at which renal phosphate reabsorption is regulated. This is accomplished by changes in the levels of apical expression and activity of specific Na+/PO42? co-transporters (NaPi-2 and NaPi-2c) in the proximal tubule. Levels of these transporters at the apical surface of these cells are reduced rapidly by PTH, the major known hormonal regulator of renal phosphate excretion. FGF23 can impair phosphate reabsorption dramatically by a similar mechnism. Activating FGF23 mutations cause the rare disorder autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets. In contrast to PTH, FGF23 also leads to reduced synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D, which may worsen the resulting hypophosphatemia by lowering intestinal phosphate absorption. Renal reabsorption of phosphate is responsive to changes in dietary intake such that experimental dietary phosphate restriction leads to a dramatic lowering of urinary phosphate within hours, preceding any decline in serum phosphate (e.g., filtered load). This physiologic renal adaptation to changes in dietary phosphate availability occurs independently of PTH and may be mediated in part by changes in levels of serum FGF23. Findings in FGF23-knockout mice suggest that FGF23 normally acts to lower blood phosphate and 1,25(OH)2D levels. In turn, elevation of blood phosphate increases blood levels of FGF23.

Renal phosphate reabsorption is impaired by hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and severe hypophosphatemia. Phosphate clearance is enhanced by ECF volume expansion and impaired by dehydration. Phosphate retention is an important pathophysiologic feature of renal insufficiency (Chap. 280).

Hypophosphatemia

Causes

Hypophosphatemia can occur by one or more of three primary mechanisms: (1) inadequate intestinal phosphate absorption, (2) excessive renal phosphate excretion, and (3) rapid redistribution of phosphate from the ECF into bone or soft tissue (Table 352-1). Because phosphate is so abundant in foods, inadequate intestinal absorption is almost never observed now that aluminum hydroxide antacids, which bind phosphate in the gut, are no longer used commonly. Fasting or starvation, however, may result in depletion of body phosphate and predispose to subsequent hypophosphatemia during refeeding, especially if this is accomplished with IV glucose alone.

Chronic hypophosphatemia usually signifies a persistent renal tubular phosphate-wasting disorder. Excessive activation of PTH/PTHrP receptors in the proximal tubule as a result of primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism or because of the PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia syndrome in malignancy (Chap. 353) is among the more common causes of renal hypophosphatemia, especially because of the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in older Americans. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and Jansen's chondrodystrophy are rare examples of genetic disorders in this category (Chap. 353).

Several genetic and acquired diseases cause PTH/PTHrP-independent tubular phosphate wasting with associated rickets and osteomalacia. All these diseases manifest severe hypophosphatemia; renal phosphate wasting, sometimes accompanied by aminoaciduria; low blood levels of 1,25(OH)2D; low-normal serum levels of calcium; and evidence of impaired cartilage or bone mineralization. Analysis of these diseases has led to the discovery of the hormone FGF23, which is an important physiologic regulator of phosphate metabolism. FGF23 decreases phosphate reabsorption in the proximal tubule and also suppresses the 1汐-hydroxylase responsible for synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D. FGF23 is synthesized by cells of the osteoblast lineage, primarily osteocytes. High-phosphate diets increase FGF23 levels, and low-phosphate diets decrease them. Autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR) was the first disease linked to abnormalities in FGF23. ADHR results from activating mutations in the gene that encodes FGF23. The most common inherited cause of hypophosphatemia is X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLHR), which results from inactivating mutations in an endopeptidase termed PHEX (phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome) that is expressed most abundantly on the surface of osteocytes and mature osteoblasts. Patients with XLH usually have high FGF23 levels, and ablation of the FGF23 gene reverses the hypophosphatemia found in the mouse version of XLH. How inactivation of PHEX leads to increased levels of FGF23 has not been determined. A third hypophosphatemic disorder, tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO), is an acquired disorder in which tumors, usually of mesenchymal origin and generally histologically benign, secrete molecules that induce renal phosphate wasting. The hypophosphatemic syndrome resolves completely within hours to days after successful resection of the responsible tumor. Such tumors express large amounts of FGF23 mRNA, and patients with TIO usually exhibit elevations of FGF23 in their blood.

Dent's disease is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by inactivating mutations in CLCN5, a chloride transporter expressed in endosomes of the proximal tubule; features include hypercalciuria, hypophosphatemia, and recurrent kidney stones. Renal phosphate wasting is common among poorly controlled diabetic patients and alcoholics, who therefore are at risk for iatrogenic hypophosphatemia when treated with insulin or IV glucose, respectively. Diuretics and certain other drugs and toxins can cause defective renal tubular phosphate reabsorption (Table 352-1).

In hospitalized patients, hypophosphatemia is often attributable to massive redistribution of phosphate from the ECF into cells. Insulin therapy for diabetic ketoacidosis is a paradigm for this phenomenon, in which the severity of the hypophosphatemia is related to the extent of antecedent depletion of phosphate and other electrolytes (Chap. 344). The hypophosphatemia is usually greatest at a point many hours after initiation of insulin therapy and is difficult to predict from baseline measurements of serum phosphate at the time of presentation, when prerenal azotemia can obscure significant phosphate depletion. Other factors that may contribute to such acute redistributive hypophosphatemia include antecedent starvation or malnutrition, administration of IV glucose without other nutrients, elevated blood catecholamines (endogenous or exogenous), respiratory alkalosis, and recovery from metabolic acidosis.

Hypophosphatemia also can occur transiently (over weeks to months) during the phase of accelerated net bone formation that follows parathyroidectomy for severe primary hyperparathyroidism or during treatment of vitamin D deficiency or lytic Paget's disease. This is usually most prominent in patients who preoperatively have evidence of high bone turnover (e.g., high serum levels of alkaline phosphatase). Osteoblastic metastases can also lead to this syndrome.

Clinical and Laboratory Findings

The clinical manifestations of severe hypophosphatemia reflect a generalized defect in cellular energy metabolism because of ATP depletion, a shift from oxidative phosphorylation toward glycolysis, and associated tissue or organ dysfunction. Acute, severe hypophosphatemia occurs mainly or exclusively in hospitalized patients with underlying serious medical or surgical illness and preexisting phosphate depletion due to excessive urinary losses, severe malabsorption, or malnutrition. Chronic hypophosphatemia tends to be less severe, with a clinical presentation dominated by musculoskeletal complaints such as bone pain, osteomalacia, pseudofractures, and proximal muscle weakness or, in children, rickets and short stature.

Neuromuscular manifestations of severe hypophosphatemia are variable but may include muscle weakness, lethargy, confusion, disorientation, hallucinations, dysarthria, dysphagia, oculomotor palsies, anisocoria, nystagmus, ataxia, cerebellar tremor, ballismus, hyporeflexia, impaired sphincter control, distal sensory deficits, paresthesia, hyperesthesia, generalized or Guillain-Barr谷每like ascending paralysis, seizures, coma, and even death. Serious sequelae such as paralysis, confusion, and seizures are likely only at phosphate concentrations <0.25 mmol/L (<0.8 mg/dL). Rhabdomyolysis may develop during rapidly progressive hypophosphatemia. The diagnosis of hypophosphatemia-induced rhabdomyolysis may be overlooked, as up to 30% of patients with acute hypophosphatemia (<0.7 mM) have creatine phosphokinase elevations that peak one to two days after the nadir in serum phosphate, when the release of phosphate from injured myocytes may have led to a near normalization of circulating levels of phosphate.

Respiratory failure and cardiac dysfunction, which are reversible with phosphate treatment, may occur at serum phosphate levels of 0.5每0.8 mmol/L (1.5每2.5 mg/dL). Renal tubular defects, including tubular acidosis, glycosuria, and impaired reabsorption of sodium and calcium, may occur. Hematologic abnormalities correlate with reductions in intracellular ATP and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and may include erythrocyte microspherocytosis and hemolysis; impaired oxyhemoglobin dissociation; defective leukocyte chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and bacterial killing; and platelet dysfunction with spontaneous gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

Treatment: Hypophosphatemia

Severe hypophosphatemia [<0.75 mmol/L (<2 mg/dL)], particularly in the setting of underlying phosphate depletion, constitutes a dangerous electrolyte abnormality that should be corrected promptly. Unfortunately, the cumulative deficit in body phosphate cannot be predicted easily from knowledge of the circulating level of phosphate, and therapy must be approached empirically. The threshold for IV phosphate therapy and the dose administered should reflect consideration of renal function, the likely severity and duration of the underlying phosphate depletion, and the presence and severity of symptoms consistent with those of hypophosphatemia. In adults, phosphate may be safely administered IV as neutral mixtures of sodium and potassium phosphate salts at initial doses of 0.2每0.8 mmol/kg of elemental phosphorus over 6 hours (e.g., 10每50 mmol over 6 hours), with doses >20 mmol/6 hours reserved for those who have serum levels <0.5 mmol/L (1.5 mg/dL) and normal renal function. A suggested approach is presented in Table 352-2. Serum levels of phosphate and calcium must be monitored closely (every 6每12 hours) throughout treatment. It is necessary to avoid a serum calcium-phosphorus product >50 to reduce the risk of heterotopic calcification. Hypocalcemia, if present, should be corrected before administering IV phosphate. Less severe hypophosphatemia, in the range of 0.5每0.8 mmol/L (1.5每2.5 mg/dL), usually can be treated with oral phosphate in divided doses of 750每2000 mg/d as elemental phosphorus; higher doses can cause bloating and diarrhea.

Management of chronic hypophosphatemia requires knowledge of the cause(s) of the disorder. Hypophosphatemia related to the secondary hyperparathyroidism of vitamin D deficiency usually responds to treatment with vitamin D and calcium alone. XLHR, ADHR, TIO, and related renal tubular disorders usually are managed with divided oral doses of phosphate, often with calcium and 1,25(OH)2D supplements to bypass the block in renal 1,25(OH)2D synthesis and prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism caused by suppression of ECF calcium levels. Thiazide diuretics may be used to prevent nephrocalcinosis in patients who are managed this way. Complete normalization of hypophosphatemia is generally not possible in these conditions. Optimal therapy for TIO is extirpation of the responsible tumor, which may be localized by radiographic skeletal survey or bone scan (many are located in bone) or by radionuclide scanning using sestamibi or labeled octreotide. Successful treatment of TIO-induced hypophosphatemia with octreotide has been reported in a small number of patients.

Hyperphosphatemia

Causes

When the filtered load of phosphate and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are normal, control of serum phosphate levels is achieved by adjusting the rate at which phosphate is reabsorbed by the proximal tubular NaPi-2 co-transporters. The principal hormonal regulators of NaPi-2 activity are PTH and FGF23. Hyperphosphatemia, defined in adults as a fasting serum phosphate concentration >1.8 mmol/L (5.5 mg/dL), usually results from impaired glomerular filtration, hypoparathyroidism, excessive delivery of phosphate into the ECF (from bone, gut, or parenteral phosphate therapy), or a combination of these factors (Table 352-3). The upper limit of normal serum phosphate concentrations is higher in children and neonates [2.4 mmol/L (7 mg/dL)]. It is useful to distinguish hyperphosphatemia caused by impaired renal phosphate excretion from that which results from excessive delivery of phosphate into the ECF (Table 352-3).

In chronic renal insufficiency, reduced GFR leads to phosphate retention. Hyperphosphatemia in turn further impairs renal synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D and stimulates PTH secretion and hypertrophy both directly and indirectly (by lowering blood ionized calcium levels). Thus, hyperphosphatemia is a major cause of the secondary hyperparathyroidism of renal failure and must be addressed early in the course of the disease (Chaps. 280 and 353).

Hypoparathyroidism leads to hyperphosphatemia via increased expression of NaPi-2 co-transporters in the proximal tubule. Hypoparathyroidism, or parathyroid suppression, has multiple potential causes, including autoimmune disease; developmental, surgical, or radiation-induced absence of functional parathyroid tissue; vitamin D intoxication or other causes of PTH-independent hypercalcemia; cellular PTH resistance (pseudohypoparathyroidism or hypomagnesemia); infiltrative disorders such as Wilson's disease and hemochromatosis; and impaired PTH secretion caused by hypermagnesemia, severe hypomagnesemia, or activating mutations in the CaSR. Hypocalcemia may also contribute directly to impaired phosphate clearance, as calcium infusion can induce hyperphosphaturia in hypoparathyroid subjects. Increased tubular phosphate reabsorption also occurs in acromegaly, during heparin administration, and in tumoral calcinosis. Tumoral calcinosis is caused by a rare group of genetic disorders in which the FGF23 gene is inactivated directly or FGF23 is processed in a way that leads to low levels of active FGF23 in the bloodstream. A similar syndrome results from FGF23 resistance due to inactivating mutations of the FGF23 co-receptor Klotho. These abnormalities cause elevated serum 1,25(OH)2D, parathyroid suppression, increased intestinal calcium absorption, and focal hyperostosis with large, lobulated periarticular heterotopic ossifications (especially at shoulders or hips) and are accompanied by hyperphosphatemia. In some forms of tumoral calcinosis serum phosphorus levels are normal.

When large amounts of phosphate are delivered rapidly into the ECF, hyperphosphatemia can occur despite normal renal function. Examples include overzealous IV phosphate therapy, oral or rectal administration of large amounts of phosphate-containing laxatives or enemas (especially in children), extensive soft tissue injury or necrosis (crush injuries, rhabdomyolysis, hyperthermia, fulminant hepatitis, cytotoxic chemotherapy), extensive hemolytic anemia, and transcellular phosphate shifts induced by severe metabolic or respiratory acidosis.

Clinical Findings

The clinical consequences of acute, severe hyperphosphatemia are due mainly to the formation of widespread calcium phosphate precipitates and resulting hypocalcemia. Thus, tetany, seizures, accelerated nephrocalcinosis (with renal failure, hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and metabolic acidosis), and pulmonary or cardiac calcifications (including development of acute heart block) may occur. The severity of these complications relates to the elevation of serum phosphate levels, which can reach concentrations as high as 7 mmol/L (20 mg/dL) in instances of massive soft tissue injury or tumor lysis syndrome.

Treatment: Hyperphosphatemia

Therapeutic options for management of severe hyperphosphatemia are limited. Volume expansion may enhance renal phosphate clearance. Aluminum hydroxide antacids or sevalamer may be helpful in chelating and limiting absorption of offending phosphate salts present in the intestine. Hemodialysis is the most effective therapeutic strategy and should be considered early in the course of severe hyperphosphatemia, especially in the setting of renal failure and symptomatic hypocalcemia.
 
Magnesium Metabolism

Magnesium is the major intracellular divalent cation. Normal concentrations of extracellular magnesium and calcium are crucial for normal neuromuscular activity. Intracellular magnesium forms a key complex with ATP and is an important cofactor for a wide range of enzymes, transporters, and nucleic acids required for normal cellular function, replication, and energy metabolism. The concentration of magnesium in serum is closely regulated within the range of 0.7每1 mmol/L (1.5每2 meq/L; 1.7每2.4 mg/dL), of which 30% is protein-bound and another 15% is loosely complexed to phosphate and other anions. One-half of the 25 g (1000 mmol) of total body magnesium is located in bone, only one-half of which is insoluble in the mineral phase. Almost all extraskeletal magnesium is present within cells, where the total concentration is 5 mM, 95% of which is bound to proteins and other macromolecules. Because only 1% of body magnesium resides in the ECF, measurements of serum magnesium levels may not accurately reflect the level of total body magnesium stores.

Dietary magnesium content normally ranges from 6 to 15 mmol/d (140每360 mg/d), of which 30每40% is absorbed, mainly in the jejunum and ileum. Intestinal magnesium absorptive efficiency is stimulated by 1,25(OH)2D and can reach 70% during magnesium deprivation. Urinary magnesium excretion normally matches net intestinal absorption and is ‵4 mmol/d (100 mg/d). Regulation of serum magnesium concentrations is achieved mainly by control of renal magnesium reabsorption. Only 20% of filtered magnesium is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, whereas 60% is reclaimed in the cTAL and another 5每10% in the DCT. Magnesium reabsorption in the cTAL occurs via a paracellular route that requires both a lumen-positive potential, created by NaCl reabsorption, and tight-junction proteins encoded by members of the Claudin gene family. Magnesium reabsorption in the cTAL is increased by PTH but inhibited by hypercalcemia or hypermagnesemia, both of which activate the CaSR in this nephron segment.

Hypomagnesemia

Causes

Hypomagnesemia usually signifies substantial depletion of body magnesium stores (0.5每1 mmol/kg). Hypomagnesemia can result from intestinal malabsorption; protracted vomiting, diarrhea, or intestinal drainage; defective renal tubular magnesium reabsorption; or rapid shifts of magnesium from the ECF into cells, bone, or third spaces (Table 352-4). Dietary magnesium deficiency is unlikely except possibly in the setting of alcoholism. A rare genetic disorder that causes selective intestinal magnesium malabsorption has been described (primary infantile hypomagnesemia). Another rare inherited disorder (hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding TRPM6, a protein that, along with TRPM7, forms a channel important for both intestinal and distal-tubular renal magnesium transport. Malabsorptive states, often compounded by vitamin D deficiency, can critically limit magnesium absorption and produce hypomagnesemia despite the compensatory effects of secondary hyperparathyroidism and of hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia to enhance cTAL magnesium reabsorption. Diarrhea or surgical drainage fluid may contain ≡5 mmol/L of magnesium.

Several genetic magnesium-wasting syndromes have been described, including inactivating mutations of genes encoding the DCT NaCl co-transporter (Gitelman's syndrome), proteins required for cTAL Na-K-2Cl transport (Bartter's syndrome), paracellin-1 (autosomal recessive renal hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria), a DCT Na+,K+-ATPase -subunit (autosomal dominant renal hypomagnesemia with hypocalciuria), and a mitochondrial DNA gene encoding a mitochondrial tRNA. ECF expansion, hypercalcemia, and severe phosphate depletion may impair magnesium reabsorption, as can various forms of renal injury, including those caused by drugs such as cisplatin, cyclosporine, aminoglycosides, and pentamidine as well as the EGF receptor inhibitory antibody cetuximab (Table 352-4). A rising blood concentration of ethanol directly impairs tubular magnesium reabsorption, and persistent glycosuria with osmotic diuresis leads to magnesium wasting and probably contributes to the high frequency of hypomagnesemia in poorly controlled diabetic patients. Magnesium depletion is aggravated by metabolic acidosis, which causes intracellular losses as well.

Hypomagnesemia due to rapid shifts of magnesium from ECF into the intracellular compartment can occur during recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis, starvation, or respiratory acidosis. Less acute shifts may be seen during rapid bone formation after parathyroidectomy, with treatment of vitamin D deficiency, or with osteoblastic metastases. Large amounts of magnesium may be lost with acute pancreatitis, extensive burns, and protracted and severe sweating and during pregnancy and lactation.

Clinical and Laboratory Findings

Hypomagnesemia may cause generalized alterations in neuromuscular function, including tetany, tremor, seizures, muscle weakness, ataxia, nystagmus, vertigo, apathy, depression, irritability, delirium, and psychosis. Patients are usually asymptomatic when serum magnesium concentrations are >0.5 mmol/L (1 meq/L; 1.2 mg/dL), although the severity of symptoms may not correlate with serum magnesium levels. Cardiac arrhythmias may occur, including sinus tachycardia, other supraventricular tachycardias, and ventricular arrhythmias. Electrocardiographic abnormalities may include prolonged PR or QT intervals, T-wave flattening or inversion, and ST straightening. Sensitivity to digitalis toxicity may be enhanced.

Other electrolyte abnormalities often seen with hypomagnesemia, including hypocalcemia (with hypocalciuria) and hypokalemia, may not be easily corrected unless magnesium is administered as well. The hypocalcemia may be a result of concurrent vitamin D deficiency, although hypomagnesemia can cause impaired synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D, cellular resistance to PTH, and, at very low serum magnesium [<0.4 mmol/L (<0.8 meq/L; <1 mg/dL)], a defect in PTH secretion; these abnormalities are reversible with therapy.

Treatment: Hypomagnesemia

Mild, asymptomatic hypomagnesemia may be treated with oral magnesium salts [MgCl2, MgO, Mg(OH)2] in divided doses totaling 20每30 mmol/d (40每60 meq/d). Diarrhea may occur with larger doses. More severe hypomagnesemia should be treated parenterally, preferably with IV MgCl2, which can be administered safely as a continuous infusion of 50 mmol/d (100 meq Mg2+/d) if renal function is normal. If GFR is reduced, the infusion rate should be lowered by 50每75%. Use of IM MgSO4 is discouraged; the injections are painful and provide relatively little magnesium (2 mL of 50% MgSO4 supplies only 4 mmol). MgSO4 may be given IV instead of MgCl2, although the sulfate anions may bind calcium in serum and urine and aggravate hypocalcemia. Serum magnesium should be monitored at intervals of 12每24 hours during therapy, which may continue for several days because of impaired renal conservation of magnesium (only 50每70% of the daily IV magnesium dose is retained) and delayed repletion of intracellular deficits, which may be as high as 1每1.5 mmol/kg (2每3 meq/kg).

It is important to consider the need for calcium, potassium, and phosphate supplementation in patients with hypomagnesemia. Vitamin D deficiency frequently coexists and should be treated with oral or parenteral vitamin D or 25(OH)D [but not with 1,25(OH)2D, which may impair tubular magnesium reabsorption, possibly via PTH suppression]. In severely hypomagnesemic patients with concomitant hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia, administration of IV magnesium alone may worsen hypophosphatemia, provoking neuromuscular symptoms or rhabdomyolysis, due to rapid stimulation of PTH secretion. This is avoided by administering both calcium and magnesium.

Hypermagnesemia

Causes

Hypermagnesemia is rarely seen in the absence of renal insufficiency, as normal kidneys can excrete large amounts (250 mmol/d) of magnesium. Mild hypermagnesemia due to excessive reabsorption in the cTAL occurs with calcium-sensing receptor mutations in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and has been described in some patients with adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, or hypothermia. Massive exogenous magnesium exposures, usually via the gastrointestinal tract, can overwhelm renal excretory capacity and cause life-threatening hypermagnesemia (Table 352-5). A notable example of this is prolonged retention of even normal amounts of magnesium-containing cathartics in patients with intestinal ileus, obstruction, or perforation. Extensive soft tissue injury or necrosis can also deliver large amounts of magnesium into the ECF in patients who have suffered trauma, shock, sepsis, cardiac arrest, or severe burns.

Clinical and Laboratory Findings

The most prominent clinical manifestations of hypermagnesemia are vasodilation and neuromuscular blockade, which may appear at serum magnesium concentrations >2 mmol/L (>4 meq/L; >4.8 mg/dL). Hypotension that is refractory to vasopressors or volume expansion may be an early sign. Nausea, lethargy, and weakness may progress to respiratory failure, paralysis, and coma, with hypoactive tendon reflexes, at serum magnesium levels >4 mmol/L. Other findings may include gastrointestinal hypomotility or ileus; facial flushing; pupillary dilation; paradoxical bradycardia; prolongation of PR, QRS, and QT intervals; heart block; and, at serum magnesium levels approaching 10 mmol/L, asystole.

Hypermagnesemia, acting via the CaSR, causes hypocalcemia and hypercalciuria due to both parathyroid suppression and impaired cTAL calcium reabsorption.

Treatment: Hypermagnesemia

Successful treatment of hypermagnesemia generally involves identifying and interrupting the source of magnesium and employing measures to increase magnesium clearance from the ECF. Use of magnesium-free cathartics or enemas may be helpful in clearing ingested magnesium from the gastrointestinal tract. Vigorous IV hydration should be attempted, if appropriate. Hemodialysis is effective and may be required in patients with significant renal insufficiency. Calcium, administered IV in doses of 100每200 mg over 1每2 hours, has been reported to provide temporary improvement in signs and symptoms of hypermagnesemia.
 
Vitamin D

Synthesis and Metabolism

1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] is the major steroid hormone involved in mineral ion homeostasis regulation. Vitamin D and its metabolites are hormones and hormone precursors rather than vitamins, since in the proper biologic setting, they can be synthesized endogenously (Fig. 352-4). In response to ultraviolet radiation of the skin, a photochemical cleavage results in the formation of vitamin D from 7-dehydrocholesterol. Cutaneous production of vitamin D is decreased by melanin and high solar protection factor sunblocks, which effectively impair skin penetration by ultraviolet light. The increased use of sunblocks in North America and Western Europe and a reduction in the magnitude of solar exposure of the general population over the last several decades has led to an increased reliance on dietary sources of vitamin D. In the United States and Canada, these sources largely consist of fortified cereals and dairy products, in addition to fish oils and egg yolks. Vitamin D from plant sources is in the form of vitamin D2, whereas that from animal sources is vitamin D3. These two forms have equivalent biologic activity and are activated equally well by the vitamin D hydroxylases in humans. Vitamin D enters the circulation, whether absorbed from the intestine or synthesized cutaneously, bound to vitamin D每binding protein, an 汐-globulin synthesized in the liver. Vitamin D is subsequently 25-hydroxylated in the liver by cytochrome P450每like enzymes in the mitochondria and microsomes. The activity of this hydroxylase is not tightly regulated, and the resultant metabolite, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], is the major circulating and storage form of vitamin D. Approximately 88% of 25(OH)D circulates bound to the vitamin D每binding protein, 0.03% is free, and the rest circulates bound to albumin. The half-life of 25(OH)D is approximately two to three weeks; however, it is shortened dramatically when vitamin D每binding protein levels are reduced, as can occur with increased urinary losses in the nephrotic syndrome.

Figure 352-4

 
 
 
Vitamin D synthesis and activation. Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin in response to ultraviolet radiation and also is absorbed from the diet. It is then transported to the liver, where it undergoes 25-hydroxylation. This metabolite is the major circulating form of vitamin D. The final step in hormone activation, 1汐-hydroxylation, occurs in the kidney.
 
 


The second hydroxylation, required for the formation of the mature hormone, occurs in the kidney (Fig. 352-5). The 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1汐-hydroxylase is a tightly regulated cytochrome P450每like mixed-function oxidase expressed in the proximal convoluted tubule cells of the kidney. PTH and hypophosphatemia are the major inducers of this microsomal enzyme, whereas calcium, FGF23, and the enzyme's product, 1,25(OH)2D, repress it. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1汐-hydroxylase is also present in epidermal keratinocytes, but keratinocyte production of 1,25(OH)2D is not thought to contribute to circulating levels of this hormone. In addition to being present in the trophoblastic layer of the placenta, the 1汐-hydroxylase is produced by macrophages associated with granulomas and lymphomas. In these latter pathologic states, the activity of the enzyme is induced by interferon  and TNF-汐 but is not regulated by calcium or 1,25(OH)2D; therefore, hypercalcemia, associated with elevated levels of 1,25(OH)2D, may be observed. Treatment of sarcoidosis-associated hypercalcemia with glucocorticoids, ketoconazole, or chloroquine reduces 1,25(OH)2D production and effectively lowers serum calcium. In contrast, chloroquine has not been shown to lower the elevated serum 1,25(OH)2D levels in patients with lymphoma.

Figure 352-5

 
 
 
Schematic representation of the hormonal control loop for vitamin D metabolism and function. A reduction in the serum calcium below ‵2.2 mmol/L (8.8 mg/dL) prompts a proportional increase in the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and so mobilizes additional calcium from the bone. PTH promotes the synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D in the kidney, which in turn stimulates the mobilization of calcium from bone and intestine and regulates the synthesis of PTH by negative feedback.
 
 

The major pathway for inactivation of vitamin D metabolites is an additional hydroxylation step by the vitamin D 24-hydroxylase, an enzyme that is expressed in most tissues. 1,25(OH)2D is the major inducer of this enzyme; therefore, this hormone promotes its own inactivation, thereby limiting its biologic effects. Polar metabolites of 1,25(OH)2D are secreted into the bile and reabsorbed via the enterohepatic circulation. Impairment of this recirculation, which is seen with diseases of the terminal ileum, leads to accelerated losses of vitamin D metabolites.

Actions of 1,25(Oh)2D

1,25(OH)2D mediates its biologic effects by binding to a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, the vitamin D receptor (VDR). This receptor belongs to the subfamily that includes the thyroid hormone receptors, the retinoid receptors, and the peroxisome proliferator每activated receptors; however, in contrast to the other members of this subfamily, only one VDR isoform has been isolated. The VDR binds to target DNA sequences as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor, recruiting a series of coactivators that modify chromatin and approximate the VDR to the basal transcriptional apparatus, resulting in the induction of target gene expression. The mechanism of transcriptional repression by the VDR varies with different target genes but has been shown to involve either interference with the action of activating transcription factors or the recruitment of novel proteins to the VDR complex, resulting in transcriptional repression.

The affinity of the VDR for 1,25(OH)2D is approximately three orders of magnitude higher than that for other vitamin D metabolites. In normal physiologic circumstances, these other metabolites are not thought to stimulate receptor-dependent actions. However, in states of vitamin D toxicity, the markedly elevated levels of 25(OH)D may lead to hypercalcemia by interacting directly with the VDR and by displacing 1,25(OH)2D from vitamin D每binding protein, resulting in increased bioavailability of the active hormone.

The VDR is expressed in a wide range of cells and tissues. The molecular actions of 1,25(OH)2D have been studied most extensively in tissues involved in the regulation of mineral ion homeostasis. This hormone is a major inducer of calbindin 9K, a calcium-binding protein expressed in the intestine, which is thought to play an important role in the active transport of calcium across the enterocyte. The two major calcium transporters expressed by intestinal epithelia, TRPV5 and TRPV6 (transient receptor potential vanilloid), are also vitamin D responsive. By inducing the expression of these and other genes in the small intestine, 1,25(OH)2D increases the efficiency of intestinal calcium absorption, and it also has been shown to have several important actions in the skeleton. The VDR is expressed in osteoblasts and regulates the expression of several genes in this cell. These genes include the bone matrix proteins osteocalcin and osteopontin, which are upregulated by 1,25(OH)2D, in addition to type I collagen, which is transcriptionally repressed by 1,25(OH)2D. Both 1,25(OH)2D and PTH induce the expression of RANK ligand, which promotes osteoclast differentiation and increases osteoclast activity, by binding to RANK on osteoclast progenitors and mature osteoclasts. This is the mechanism by which 1,25(OH)2D induces bone resorption. However, the skeletal features associated with VDR-knockout mice (rickets, osteomalacia) are largely corrected by increasing calcium and phosphorus intake, underscoring the importance of vitamin D action in the gut.

The VDR is expressed in the parathyroid gland, and 1,25(OH)2D has been shown to have antiproliferative effects on parathyroid cells and to suppress the transcription of the parathyroid hormonegene. These effects of 1,25(OH)2D on the parathyroid gland are an important part of the rationale for current therapies directed at preventing and treating hyperparathyroidism associated with renal insufficiency.

The VDR is also expressed in tissues and organs that do not play a role in mineral ion homeostasis. Notable in this respect is the observation that 1,25(OH)2D has an antiproliferative effect on several cell types, including keratinocytes, breast cancer cells, and prostate cancer cells. The effects of 1,25(OH)2D and the VDR on keratinocytes are particularly intriguing. Alopecia is seen in humans and mice with mutant VDRs but is not a feature of vitamin D deficiency; thus, the effects of the VDR on the hair follicle are ligand-independent.

Vitamin D Deficiency

The mounting concern about the relationship between solar exposure and the development of skin cancer has led to increased reliance on dietary sources of vitamin D. Although the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency varies, the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) revealed that vitamin D deficiency is prevalent throughout the United States. The clinical syndrome of vitamin D deficiency can be a result of deficient production of vitamin D in the skin, lack of dietary intake, accelerated losses of vitamin D, impaired vitamin D activation, or resistance to the biologic effects of 1,25(OH)2D (Table 352-6). The elderly and nursing home residents are particularly at risk for vitamin D deficiency, since both the efficiency of vitamin D synthesis in the skin and the absorption of vitamin D from the intestine decline with age. Similarly, intestinal malabsorption of dietary fats leads to vitamin D deficiency. This is further exacerbated in the presence of terminal ileal disease, which results in impaired enterohepatic circulation of vitamin D metabolites. In addition to intestinal diseases, accelerated inactivation of vitamin D metabolites can be seen with drugs that induce hepatic cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidases such as barbiturates, phenytoin, and rifampin. Impaired 25-hydroxylation, associated with severe liver disease or isoniazid, is an uncommon cause of vitamin D deficiency. A mutation in the gene responsible for 25- hydroxylation has been identified in one kindred. Impaired 1汐-hydroxylation is prevalent in the population with profound renal dysfunction due to an increase in circulating FGF23 levels and a decrease in functional renal mass. Thus, therapeutic interventions should be considered in patients whose creatinine clearance is <0.5 mL/s (30 mL/min). Mutations in the renal 1汐-hydroxylase are the basis for the genetic disorder, pseudovitamin D每deficiency rickets. This autosomal recessive disorder presents with the syndrome of vitamin D deficiency in the first year of life. Patients present with growth retardation, rickets, and hypocalcemic seizures. Serum 1,25(OH)2D levels are low despite normal 25(OH)D levels and elevated PTH levels. Treatment with vitamin D metabolites that do not require 1汐-hydroxylation results in disease remission, although lifelong therapy is required. A second autosomal recessive disorder, hereditary vitamin D每resistant rickets, a consequence of vitamin D receptor mutations, is a greater therapeutic challenge. These patients present in a similar fashion during the first year of life, but alopecia often accompanies the disorder, demonstrating a functional role of the VDR in postnatal hair regeneration. Serum levels of 1,25(OH)2D are dramatically elevated in these individuals both because of increased production due to stimulation of 1汐-hydroxylase activity as a consequence of secondary hyperparathyroidism and because of impaired inactivation, since induction of the 24-hydroxylase by 1,25(OH)2D requires an intact VDR. Since the receptor mutation results in hormone resistance, daily calcium and phosphorus infusions may be required to bypass the defect in intestinal mineral ion absorption.

Regardless of the cause, the clinical manifestations of vitamin D deficiency are largely a consequence of impaired intestinal calcium absorption. Mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency is asymptomatic, whereas long-standing vitamin D deficiency results in hypocalcemia accompanied by secondary hyperparathyroidism, impaired mineralization of the skeleton (osteopenia on x-ray or decreased bone mineral density), and proximal myopathy. Vitamin D deficiency also has been shown to be associated with an increase in overall mortality rates, including cardiovascular causes. In the absence of an intercurrent illness, the hypocalcemia associated with long-standing vitamin D deficiency rarely presents with acute symptoms of hypocalcemia such as numbness, tingling, and seizures. However, the concurrent development of hypomagnesemia, which impairs parathyroid function, or the administration of potent bisphosphonates, which impair bone resorption, can lead to acute symptomatic hypocalcemia in vitamin D每deficient individuals.

Rickets and Osteomalacia

In children, before epiphyseal fusion, vitamin D deficiency results in growth retardation associated with an expansion of the growth plate known as rickets. Three layers of chondrocytes are present in the normal growth plate: the reserve zone, the proliferating zone, and the hypertrophic zone. Rickets associated with impaired vitamin D action is characterized by expansion of the hypertrophic chondrocyte layer. The proliferation and differentiation of the chondrocytes in the rachitic growth plate are normal, and the expansion of the growth plate is a consequence of impaired apoptosis of the late hypertrophic chondrocytes, an event that precedes replacement of these cells by osteoblasts during endochondral bone formation. Investigations in murine models demonstrate that hypophosphatemia, which in vitamin D deficiency is a consequence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, is a key etiologic factor in the development of the rachitic growth plate.

The hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia that accompany vitamin D deficiency result in impaired mineralization of bone matrix proteins, a condition known as osteomalacia. Osteomalacia is also a feature of long-standing hypophosphatemia, which may be a consequence of renal phosphate wasting or chronic use of etidronate or phosphate-binding antacids. This hypomineralized matrix is biomechanically inferior to normal bone; as a result, patients with vitamin D deficiency are prone to bowing of weight-bearing extremities and skeletal fractures. Vitamin D and calcium supplementation have been shown to decrease the incidence of hip fracture among ambulatory nursing home residents in France, suggesting that undermineralization of bone contributes significantly to morbidity in the elderly. Proximal myopathy is a striking feature of severe vitamin D deficiency both in children and in adults. Rapid resolution of the myopathy is observed upon vitamin D treatment.

Though vitamin D deficiency is the most common cause of rickets and osteomalacia, many disorders lead to inadequate mineralization of the growth plate and bone. Calcium deficiency without vitamin D deficiency, the disorders of vitamin D metabolism previously discussed, and hypophosphatemia can all lead to inefficient mineralization. Even in the presence of normal calcium and phosphate levels, chronic acidosis and drugs such as bisphosphonates can lead to osteomalacia. The inorganic calcium/phosphate mineral phase of bone cannot form at low pH, and bisphosphonates bind to and prevent mineral crystal growth. Since alkaline phosphatase is necessary for normal mineral deposition, probably because the enzyme can hydrolyze inhibitors of mineralization such as inorganic pyrophosphate, genetic inactivation of the alkaline phosphatase gene (hereditary hypophosphatasia) also can lead to osteomalacia in the setting of normal calcium and phosphate levels.

Diagnosis of Vitamin D Deficiency, Rickets, and Osteomalacia

The most specific screening test for vitamin D deficiency in otherwise healthy individuals is a serum 25(OH)D level. Although the normal ranges vary, levels of 25(OH)D <37 nmol/L (<15 ng/mL) are associated with increasing PTH levels and lower bone density; optimal vitamin D levels are >80 nmol/L (>32 ng/mL). Vitamin D deficiency leads to impaired intestinal absorption of calcium, resulting in decreased serum total and ionized calcium values. This hypocalcemia results in secondary hyperparathyroidism, a homeostatic response that initially maintains serum calcium levels at the expense of the skeleton. Due to the PTH-induced increase in bone turnover, alkaline phosphatase levels are often increased. In addition to increasing bone resorption, PTH decreases urinary calcium excretion while promoting phosphaturia. This results in hypophosphatemia, which exacerbates the mineralization defect in the skeleton. With prolonged vitamin D deficiency resulting in osteomalacia, calcium stores in the skeleton become relatively inaccessible, since osteoclasts cannot resorb unmineralized osteoid, and frank hypocalcemia ensues. Since PTH is a major stimulus for the renal 25(OH)D 1汐-hydroxylase, there is increased synthesis of the active hormone, 1,25(OH)2D. Paradoxically, levels of this hormone are often normal in severe vitamin D deficiency. Therefore, measurements of 1,25(OH)2D are not accurate reflections of vitamin D stores and should not be used to diagnose vitamin D deficiency in patients with normal renal function.

Radiologic features of vitamin D deficiency in children include a widened, expanded growth plate that is characteristic of rickets. These findings not only are apparent in the long bones but also are present at the costochondral junction, where the expansion of the growth plate leads to swellings known as the "rachitic rosary." Impairment of intramembranous bone mineralization leads to delayed fusion of the calvarial sutures and a decrease in the radi-opacity of cortical bone in the long bones. If vitamin D deficiency occurs after epiphyseal fusion, the main radiologic finding is a decrease in cortical thickness and relative radiolucency of the skeleton. A specific radiologic feature of osteomalacia, whether associated with phosphate wasting or vitamin D deficiency, is pseudofractures, or Looser's zones. These are radiolucent lines that occur where large arteries are in contact with the underlying skeletal elements; it is thought that the arterial pulsations lead to the radiolucencies. As a result, these pseudofractures are usually a few millimeters wide, are several centimeters long, and are seen particularly in the scapula, the pelvis, and the femoral neck.

Treatment: Vitamin D Deficiency

Daily intake of a multivitamin (400 IU) is often insufficient to prevent vitamin D deficiency. Based on the observation that 800 IU of vitamin D, with calcium supplementation, decreases the risk of hip fractures in elderly women, this higher dose is thought to be an appropriate daily intake for prevention of vitamin D deficiency in adults. The safety margin for vitamin D is large, and vitamin D toxicity usually is observed only in patients taking doses in the range of 40,000 IU daily. Treatment of vitamin D deficiency should be directed at the underlying disorder, if possible, and also should be tailored to the severity of the condition. Vitamin D should always be repleted in conjunction with calcium supplementation since most of the consequences of vitamin D deficiency are a result of impaired mineral ion homeostasis. In patients in whom 1汐-hydroxylation is impaired, metabolites that do not require this activation step are the treatment of choice. They include 1,25(OH)2D3 [calcitriol (Rocaltrol), 0.25每0.5 g/d] and 1汐-hydroxyvitamin D2 (Hectorol, 2.5每5 g/d). If the pathway required for activation of vitamin D is intact, severe vitamin D deficiency can be treated with pharmacologic repletion initially (50,000 IU weekly for 3每12 weeks), followed by maintenance therapy (800 IU daily). Pharmacologic doses may be required for maintenance therapy in patients who are taking medications such as barbiturates or phenytoin, that accelerate metabolism of, or cause resistance to 1,25(OH)2D. Calcium supplementation should include 1.5每2 g/d of elemental calcium. Normocalcemia is usually observed within one week of the institution of therapy, although increases in PTH and alkaline phosphatase levels may persist for three to six months. The most efficacious methods to monitor treatment and resolution of vitamin D deficiency are serum and urinary calcium measurements. In patients who are vitamin D replete and are taking adequate calcium supplementation, the 24-hour urinary calcium excretion should be in the range of 100每250 mg/ 24 hours. Lower levels suggest problems with adherence to the treatment regimen or with absorption of calcium or vitamin D supplements. Levels >250 mg/24 hours predispose to nephrolithiasis and should lead to a reduction in vitamin D dosage and/or calcium supplementation.

 Chapter 353. Disorders of the Parathyroid Gland and Calcium Homeostasis >
 

Disorders of the Parathyroid Gland and Calcium Homeostasis: Introduction

The four parathyroid glands are located posterior to the thyroid gland. They produce parathyroid hormone (PTH), which is the primary regulator of calcium physiology. PTH acts directly on bone, where it induces calcium resorption, and on the kidney, where it enhances calcium reabsorption and synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], a hormone that increases gastrointestinal calcium absorption. Serum PTH levels are tightly regulated by a negative feedback loop. Calcium, acting through the calcium-sensing receptor, and vitamin D, acting through its nuclear receptor, reduce PTH release and synthesis. Additional evidence indicates that fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a phosphaturic hormone, can suppress PTH secretion. Understanding the hormonal pathways that regulate calcium levels and bone metabolism is essential for effective diagnosis and management of a wide array of hyper- and hypocalcemic disorders.

Hyperparathyroidism (HPT), characterized by excess production of PTH, is a common cause of hypercalcemia and is usually the result of autonomously functioning adenomas or hyperplasia. Surgery for this disorder is highly effective and has been shown to reverse some of the deleterious effects of long-standing PTH excess on bone density. Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy is also common and is usually due to the overproduction of parathyroid hormone每related peptide (PTHrP) by cancer cells. The similarities in the biochemical characteristics of hyperparathyroidism and humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, first noted by Albright in 1941, are now known to reflect the actions of PTH and PTHrP through the same G protein每coupled PTH/PTHrP receptor.

The genetic basis of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types 1 and 2, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH), different forms of pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP), Jansen's syndrome, disorders of vitamin D synthesis and action, and the molecular events associated with parathyroid gland neoplasia have provided new insights into the regulation of calcium homeostasis. PTH and possibly some of its analogues are promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of postmenopausal or senile osteoporosis, and calcimimetic agents, which activate the calcium-sensing receptor, have provided new approaches for PTH suppression.
 
Parathyroid Hormone

Physiology

The primary function of PTH is to maintain the extracellular fluid (ECF) calcium concentration within a narrow normal range. The hormone acts directly on bone and kidney and indirectly on the intestine through its effects on synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D to increase serum calcium concentrations; in turn, PTH production is closely regulated by the concentration of serum ionized calcium. This feedback system is the critical homeostatic mechanism for maintenance of ECF calcium. Any tendency toward hypocalcemia, as might be induced by calcium-deficient diets, is counteracted by an increased secretion of PTH. This in turn (1) increases the rate of dissolution of bone mineral, thereby increasing the flow of calcium from bone into blood; (2) reduces the renal clearance of calcium, returning more of the calcium filtered at the glomerulus into ECF; and (3) increases the efficiency of calcium absorption in the intestine by stimulating the production of 1,25(OH)2D. Immediate control of blood calcium is due to PTH effects on bone and, to a lesser extent, on renal calcium clearance. Maintenance of steady-state calcium balance, on the other hand, probably results from the effects of 1,25(OH)2D on calcium absorption (Chap. 352). The renal actions of the hormone are exerted at multiple sites and include inhibition of phosphate transport (proximal tubule), augmentation of calcium reabsorption (distal tubule), and stimulation of the renal 25(OH)D-1汐-hydroxylase. As much as 12 mmol (500 mg) calcium is transferred between the ECF and bone each day (a large amount in relation to the total ECF calcium pool), and PTH has a major effect on this transfer. The homeostatic role of the hormone can preserve calcium concentration in blood at the cost of bone demineralization.

PTH has multiple actions on bone, some direct and some indirect. PTH-mediated changes in bone calcium release can be seen within minutes. The chronic effects of PTH are to increase the number of bone cells, both osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and to increase the remodeling of bone; these effects are apparent within hours after the hormone is given and persist for hours after PTH is withdrawn. Continuous exposure to elevated PTH (as in hyperparathyroidism or long-term infusions in animals) leads to increased osteoclast- mediated bone resorption. However, the intermittent administration of PTH, elevating hormone levels for 1每2 hours each day, leads to a net stimulation of bone formation rather than bone breakdown. Striking increases, especially in trabecular bone in the spine and hip, have been reported with the use of PTH in combination with estrogen. PTH(1-34) as monotherapy caused a highly significant reduction in fracture incidence in a worldwide placebo-controlled trial.

Osteoblasts (or stromal cell precursors), which have PTH/PTHrP receptors, are crucial to this bone-forming effect of PTH; osteoclasts, which mediate bone breakdown, lack such receptors. PTH-mediated stimulation of osteoclasts is indirect, acting in part, through cytokines released from osteoblasts to activate osteoclasts; in experimental studies of bone resorption in vitro, osteoblasts must be present for PTH to activate osteoclasts to resorb bone (Chap. 352).

Structure

PTH is an 84-amino-acid single-chain peptide. The amino-terminal portion, PTH(1每34), is highly conserved and is critical for the biologic actions of the molecule. Modified synthetic fragments of the amino-terminal sequence as small as PTH(1每11) are sufficient to activate the PTH/PTHrP receptor (see below). The carboxyl-terminal regions of the full-length PTH(1每84) molecule also can bind to a separate binding protein/receptor (cPTH-R), but this receptor has been incompletely characterized. Fragments shortened at the amino terminus possibly by binding to cPTH can inhibit some of the biologic actions of full-length PTH(1每84) and of PTH(1每34).

Biosynthesis, Secretion, and Metabolism

Synthesis

Parathyroid cells have multiple methods of adapting to increased needs for PTH production. Most rapid (within minutes) is secretion of preformed hormone in response to hypocalcemia. Second, within hours, PTH mRNA expression is induced by sustained hypocalcemia. Finally, protracted challenge leads within days to cellular replication to increase gland mass.

PTH is initially synthesized as a larger molecule (preproparathyroid hormone, consisting of 115 amino acids). After a first cleavage step to remove the "pre" sequence of 25 amino acid residues, a second cleavage step removes the "pro" sequence of 6 amino acid residues before secretion of the mature peptide comprising 84 residues. In one kindred with hypoparathyroidism, a mutation in the preprotein region of the gene interferes with hormone transport and secretion.

Transcriptional suppression of the PTH gene by calcium is nearly maximal at physiologic calcium concentrations. Hypocalcemia increases transcriptional activity within hours. 1,25(OH)2D3 strongly suppresses PTH gene transcription. In patients with renal failure, IV administration of supraphysiologic levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 or analogues of this active metabolite can dramatically suppress PTH overproduction, which is sometimes difficult to control due to severe secondary HPT. Regulation of proteolytic destruction of preformed hormone (posttranslational regulation of hormone production) is an important mechanism for mediating rapid (minutes) changes in hormone availability. High calcium increases and low calcium inhibit the proteolytic destruction of hormone stores.

Regulation of PTH Secretion

PTH secretion increases steeply to a maximum value of about five times the basal rate of secretion as calcium concentration falls from normal to the range of 1.9每2 mmol/L (7.5每8 mg/dL) (measured as total calcium). The ionized fraction of blood calcium is the important determinant of hormone secretion. Severe intracellular magnesium deficiency impairs PTH secretion (see below).

ECF calcium controls PTH secretion by interaction with a calcium sensor, a G protein每coupled receptor (GPCR) for which Ca2+ ions act as the primary ligand (see below). This receptor is a member of a distinctive subgroup of the GPCR superfamily that is characterized by a large extracellular domain suitable for "clamping" the small-molecule ligand. Stimulation of the receptor by high calcium levels suppresses PTH secretion. The receptor is present in parathyroid glands and the calcitonin-secreting cells of the thyroid (C cells), as well as in other sites such as brain and kidney. Genetic evidence has revealed a key biologic role for the calcium-sensing receptor in parathyroid gland responsiveness to calcium and in renal calcium clearance. Heterozygous point mutations associated with loss-of-function cause the syndrome of FHH, in which the blood calcium abnormality resembles that observed in hyperparathyroidism but with hypocalciuria. On the other hand, heterozygous gain-of-function mutations cause a form of hypocalcemia resembling hypoparathyroidism (see below).

Metabolism

The secreted form of PTH is indistinguishable by immunologic criteria and by molecular size from the 84-amino-acid peptide [PTH(1每84)] extracted from glands. However, much of the immunoreactive material found in the circulation is smaller than the extracted or secreted hormone. The principal circulating fragments of immunoreactive hormone lack a portion of the critical amino-terminal sequence required for biologic activity and, hence, are biologically inactive fragments (so-called middle and carboxyl-terminal fragments). Much of the proteolysis of hormone occurs in the liver and kidney. Peripheral metabolism of PTH does not appear to be regulated by physiologic states (high versus low calcium, etc.); hence, peripheral metabolism of hormone, although responsible for rapid clearance of secreted hormone, appears to be a high-capacity, metabolically invariant catabolic process.

The rate of clearance of the secreted 84-amino-acid peptide from blood is more rapid than the rate of clearance of the biologically inactive fragment(s) corresponding to the middle and carboxyl-terminal regions of PTH. Consequently, the interpretation of results obtained with earlier PTH radioimmunoassays is influenced by the nature of the peptide fragments detected by the antibodies.

Although the problems inherent in PTH measurements have been largely circumvented by use of double-antibody immunometric assays, it is now known that some of these assays detect, besides the intact molecule, large amino-terminally truncated forms of PTH, which are present in normal and uremic individuals in addition to PTH(1每84). The concentration of these fragments relative to that of intact PTH(1每84) is higher with induced hypercalcemia than in eucalcemic or hypocalcemic conditions and is higher in patients with renal failure. These fragments have limited portions of the amino-terminal portion of the hormone removed; PTH(7每84) has been identified as a major component of these amino-terminally truncated fragments. Growing evidence suggests that the PTH(7每84) (and probably related amino-terminally truncated fragments) can act, through yet undefined mechanisms, as an inhibitor of PTH action and may be of clinical significance, particularly in renal failure. In this group of patients, efforts to prevent secondary HPT by a variety of measures (vitamin D analogues, higher calcium intake, higher dialysate calcium, and phosphate-lowering strategies) may have led to oversuppression of biologically active, intact PTH since some amino-terminally truncated PTH fragments such as PTH(7每84), react in many immunometric PTH assays (now termed second-generation assays; see below under "Diagnosis"). Excessive parathyroid gland suppression due to overly aggressive treatment with vitamin D analogues and calcium-containing phosphate binders or inaccurate PTH measurements can lead to adynamic bone disease in renal failure (see below). Adynamic bone disease has been associated in children with further impaired growth and increased bone fracture rates in adults, and can furthermore lead to significant hypercalcemia. The measurement of PTH with newer third-generation immunometric assays, which use detection antibodies directed against extreme amino-terminal PTH epitopes and thus detect only full-length PTH(1每84), may provide some advantage to prevent bone disease in chronic kidney disease.
 
Parathyroid Hormone每Related Protein (Pthrp)

PTHrP is responsible for most instances of hypercalcemia of malignancy (Chap. 100), a syndrome that resembles HPT but without elevated PTH levels. Most cell types produce PTHrP, including brain, pancreas, heart, lung, mammary tissue, placenta, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle. In fetal animals, PTHrP directs transplacental calcium transfer, and high concentrations of PTHrP are produced in mammary tissue and secreted into milk, but the biologic significance of the very high concentrations of this hormone in breast milk is unknown. PTHrP also plays an essential role in endochondral bone formation and in branching morphogenesis of the breast, and possibly in uterine contraction and other biologic functions.

PTH and PTHrP, although distinctive products of different genes, exhibit considerable functional and structural homology (Fig. 353-1) and have evolved from a shared ancestral gene. The structure of the gene for human PTHrP, however, is more complex than that of PTH, containing multiple additional exons, which can undergo alternate splicing patterns during formation of the mature mRNA. Protein products of 141, 139, and 173 amino acids are produced, and other molecular forms may result from tissue-specific degradation at accessible internal cleavage sites. The biologic roles of these various molecular species and the nature of the circulating forms of PTHrP are unclear. It is uncertain whether PTHrP circulates at any significant level in adults. As a paracrine factor, PTHrP may be produced, act, and be destroyed locally within tissues. In adults, PTHrP appears to have little influence on calcium homeostasis, except in disease states, when large tumors, especially of the squamous cell type as well as renal cell carcinomas, lead to massive overproduction of the hormone and hypercalcemia.

Figure 353-1

 
 
 
Schematic diagram to illustrate similarities and differences in structure of human parathyroid hormone (PTH) and human PTH-related peptide (PTHrP). Close structural (and functional) homology exists between the first 30 amino acids of hPTH and hPTHrP. The PTHrP sequence may be ≡144 amino acid residues in length. PTH is only 84 residues long; after residue 30, there is little structural homology between the two. Dashed lines in the PTHrP sequence indicate identity; underlined residues, although different from those of PTH, still represent conservative changes (charge or polarity preserved). Ten amino acids are identical, and a total of 20 of 30 are homologues.
 
 

PTH and Pthrp Hormone Action

Both PTH and PTHrP bind to and activate the PTH/PTHrP receptor. The PTH/PTHrP receptor (also known as the PTH-1 receptor, PTH1R) belongs to a subfamily of GPCRs that includes the receptors for calcitonin, glucagon, secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and other peptides. Although both ligands activate the PTH1R, the two peptides induce distinct responses in the receptor, which explains how a single receptor without isoforms can serve two biologic roles. The extracellular regions of the receptor are involved in hormone binding, and the intracellular domains, after hormone activation, bind G protein subunits to transduce hormone signaling into cellular responses through the stimulation of second messenger formation. A second receptor that binds PTH, originally termed the PTH-2 receptor (PTH2R), is primarily expressed in brain, pancreas, and testis. Different mammalian PTH1Rs respond equivalently to PTH and PTHrP, whereas only the human PTH2R responds efficiently to PTH (but not to PTHrP), PTH2Rs from other species show little or no stimulation of second-messenger formation in response to PTH or PTHrP. The endogenous ligand of the PTH2R was shown to be a hypothalamic peptide referred to as tubular infundibular peptide of 39 residues, TIP39, that is distantly related to PTH. The PTH1R and the PTH2R can be traced backward in evolutionary time to fish; in fact, the zebrafish genome contains, in addition to the PTH1R and the PTH2R orthologs, a third receptor, the PTH3R, that is more closely related to the fish PTH1R than the fish PTH2R. The evolutionary conservation of structure and function suggests important biologic roles for these receptors, even in fish, which lack discrete parathyroid glands but produce two molecules that are closely related to mammalian PTH.

Studies using the cloned PTH1R confirm that it can be coupled to more than one G protein and second-messenger pathway, apparently explaining the multiplicity of pathways stimulated by PTH. Stimulation of protein kinases (A and C) and calcium transport channels is associated with a variety of hormone-specific tissue responses. These responses include inhibition of phosphate and bicarbonate transport, stimulation of calcium transport, and activation of renal 1汐-hydroxylase in the kidney. The responses in bone include effects on collagen synthesis, alkaline phosphatase, ornithine decarboxylase, citrate decarboxylase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities, phospholipid synthesis, as well as calcium and phosphate transport. Ultimately, these biochemical events lead to an integrated hormonal response in bone turnover and calcium homeostasis. PTH also activates Na+/Ca2+ exchangers at renal distal tubular sites and stimulates translocation of preformed calcium transport channels, moving them from the interior to the apical surface to increase tubular uptake of calcium. PTH-dependent stimulation of phosphate excretion (reducing reabsorption〞the opposite effect from actions on calcium in the kidney) involves the down regulation of two sodium-dependent phosphate co-transporters, NPT2a and NPT2c, and expression at the apical membrane, thereby reducing phosphate reabsorption. Similar mechanisms may be involved in other renal tubular transporters that are influenced by PTH.

PTHrP exerts important developmental influences on fetal bone development and in adult physiology. A homozygous ablation of the gene encoding PTHrP (or disruption of the gene encoding the PTH/PTHrP receptor) in mice causes a lethal phenotype in which animals are born with pronounced acceleration of chondrocyte maturation that resembles a lethal form of chondrodysplasia in humans (Fig. 353-2). Mice that are heterozygous for ablation of the PTHrP gene display reduced mineral density consistent with osteoporosis. Experiments with these mouse models point to a hitherto unappreciated role of PTHrP as a paracrine/autocrine factor that modulates bone metabolism in adults as well as during bone development.

Figure 353-2

 
 
 
Dual role for the actions of the PTH/PTHrP receptor (PTH1R). Parathyroid hormone (PTH; endocrine-calcium homeostasis) and PTH-related peptide (PTHrP; paracrine每multiple tissue actions including growth plate cartilage in developing bone) use the single receptor for their disparate functions mediated by the amino-terminal 30 residues of either peptide. Other regions of both ligands interact with other receptors (not shown).
 
 
 
Calcitonin

(See also Chap. 351) Calcitonin is a hypocalcemic peptide hormone that in several mammalian species acts as an antagonist to PTH. Calcitonin seems to be of limited physiologic significance in humans, at least with regard to calcium homeostasis. It is of medical significance because of its role as a tumor marker in sporadic and hereditary cases of medullary carcinoma and its medical use as an adjunctive treatment in severe hypercalcemia and in Paget's disease of bone.

The hypocalcemic activity of calcitonin is accounted for primarily by inhibition of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and secondarily by stimulation of renal calcium clearance. These effects are mediated by receptors on osteoclasts and renal tubular cells. Calcitonin exerts additional effects through receptors present in the brain, the gastrointestinal tract, and the immune system. The hormone, for example, exerts analgesic effects directly on cells in the hypothalamus and related structures, possibly by interacting with receptors for related peptide hormones such as calcitonin gene每related peptide (CGRP) or amylin. The latter ligands have specific high-affinity receptors and can also bind to and trigger calcitonin receptors. The calcitonin receptor shares considerable structural similarity with the PTH1R.

The thyroid is the major source of the hormone, and the cells involved in calcitonin synthesis arise from neural crest tissue. During embryogenesis, these cells migrate into the ultimobranchial body, derived from the last branchial pouch. In submammalian vertebrates, the ultimobranchial body constitutes a discrete organ, anatomically separate from the thyroid gland; in mammals, the ultimobranchial gland fuses with and is incorporated into the thyroid gland.

The naturally occurring calcitonins consist of a peptide chain of 32 amino acids. There is considerable sequence variability among species. Calcitonin from salmon, which is used therapeutically, is 10每100 times more potent than mammalian forms in lowering serum calcium.

There are two calcitoningenes, 汐 and 汕; the transcriptional control of these genes is complex. Two different mRNA molecules are transcribed from the 汐 gene; one is translated into the precursor for calcitonin, and the other message is translated into an alternative product, CGRP. CGRP is synthesized wherever the calcitonin mRNA is expressed (e.g., in medullary carcinoma of the thyroid). The 汕, or CGRP-2, gene is transcribed into the mRNA for CGRP in the central nervous system (CNS); this gene does not produce calcitonin, however. CGRP has cardiovascular actions and may serve as a neurotransmitter or play a developmental role in the CNS.

The circulating level of calcitonin in humans is lower than that in many other species. In humans, even extreme variations in calcitonin production do not change calcium and phosphate metabolism; no definite effects are attributable to calcitonin deficiency (totally thyroidectomized patients receiving only replacement thyroxine) or excess (patients with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, a calcitonin-secreting tumor) (Chap. 351). Calcitonin has been a useful pharmacologic agent to suppress bone resorption in Paget's disease (Chap. 355) and osteoporosis (Chap. 354) and in the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy (see below). However, the physiologic role, if any, of calcitonin in humans is uncertain. On the other hand, a knockout of the calcitonin gene in mice leads to reduced bone mineral density, suggesting that its biologic role in mammals is still not fully understood.
 
Hypercalcemia

(See also Chap. 46) Hypercalcemia can be a manifestation of a serious illness such as malignancy or can be detected coincidentally by laboratory testing in a patient with no obvious illness. The number of patients recognized with asymptomatic hypercalcemia, usually hyperparathyroidism, increased in the late twentieth century.

Whenever hypercalcemia is confirmed, a definitive diagnosis must be established. Although hyperparathyroidism, a frequent cause of asymptomatic hypercalcemia, is a chronic disorder in which manifestations, if any, may be expressed only after months or years, hypercalcemia can also be the earliest manifestation of malignancy, the second most common cause of hypercalcemia in the adult. The causes of hypercalcemia are numerous (Table 353-1), but hyperparathyroidism and cancer account for 90% of all cases.

Before undertaking a diagnostic workup, it is essential to be sure that true hypercalcemia, not a false-positive laboratory test, is present. A false-positive diagnosis of hypercalcemia is usually the result of inadvertent hemoconcentration during blood collection or elevation in serum proteins such as albumin. Hypercalcemia is a chronic problem, and it is cost-effective to obtain several serum calcium measurements; these tests need not be in the fasting state.

Clinical features are helpful in differential diagnosis. Hypercalcemia in an adult who is asymptomatic is usually due to primary hyperparathyroidism. In malignancy-associated hypercalcemia, the disease is usually not occult; rather, symptoms of malignancy bring the patient to the physician, and hypercalcemia is discovered during the evaluation. In such patients, the interval between detection of hypercalcemia and death, especially without vigorous treatment, is often <6 months. Accordingly, if an asymptomatic individual has had hypercalcemia or some manifestation of hypercalcemia such as kidney stones for >1 or 2 years, it is unlikely that malignancy is the cause. Nevertheless, differentiating primary hyperparathyroidism from occult malignancy can occasionally be difficult, and careful evaluation is required, particularly when the duration of the hypercalcemia is unknown. Hypercalcemia not due to hyperparathyroidism or malignancy can result from excessive vitamin D action, high bone turnover from any of several causes, or from renal failure (Table 353-1). Dietary history and a history of ingestion of vitamins or drugs are often helpful in diagnosing some of the less frequent causes. Immunometric PTH assays serve as the principal laboratory test in establishing the diagnosis.

Hypercalcemia from any cause can result in fatigue, depression, mental confusion, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, reversible renal tubular defects, increased urination, a short QT interval in the electrocardiogram, and, in some patients, cardiac arrhythmias. There is a variable relation from one patient to the next between the severity of hypercalcemia and the symptoms. Generally, symptoms are more common at calcium levels >2.9每3 mmol/L (11.5每12 mg/dL), but some patients, even at this level, are asymptomatic. When the calcium level is >3.2 mmol/L (13 mg/dL), calcification in kidneys, skin, vessels, lungs, heart, and stomach occurs and renal insufficiency may develop, particularly if blood phosphate levels are normal or elevated due to impaired renal function. Severe hypercalcemia, usually defined as ≡3.7每4.5 mmol/L (15每18 mg/dL), can be a medical emergency; coma and cardiac arrest can occur.

Acute management of the hypercalcemia is usually successful. The type of treatment is based on the severity of the hypercalcemia and the nature of associated symptoms, as outlined below.

Primary Hyperparathyroidism

Natural History and Incidence

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a generalized disorder of calcium, phosphate, and bone metabolism due to an increased secretion of PTH. The elevation of circulating hormone usually leads to hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. There is great variation in the manifestations. Patients may present with multiple signs and symptoms, including recurrent nephrolithiasis, peptic ulcers, mental changes, and, less frequently, extensive bone resorption. However, with greater awareness of the disease and wider use of multiphasic screening tests, including measurements of blood calcium, the diagnosis is frequently made in patients who have no symptoms and minimal, if any, signs of the disease other than hypercalcemia and elevated levels of PTH. The manifestations may be subtle, and the disease may have a benign course for many years or a lifetime. This milder form of the disease is usually termed asymptomatic HPT. Rarely, hyperparathyroidism develops or worsens abruptly and causes severe complications such as marked dehydration and coma, so-called hypercalcemic parathyroid crisis.

The annual incidence of the disease is calculated to be as high as 0.2% in patients >60, with an estimated prevalence, including undiscovered asymptomatic patients, of ≡1%; some reports suggest the incidence may be declining. If confirmed, these changing estimates may reflect less frequent routine testing of serum calcium in recent years, earlier overestimates in incidence, or unknown factors. The disease has a peak incidence between the third and fifth decades but occurs in young children and in the elderly.

Etiology

Parathyroid tumors are most often encountered as isolated adenomas without other endocrinopathy. They may also arise in hereditary syndromes such as MEN syndromes. Parathyroid tumors may also arise as secondary to underlying disease (excessive stimulation in secondary hyperparathyroidism, especially chronic renal failure), or after other forms of excessive stimulation such as lithium therapy. These etiologies are discussed below.

Solitary Adenomas

A single abnormal gland is the cause in ‵80% of patients; the abnormality in the gland is usually a benign neoplasm or adenoma and rarely a parathyroid carcinoma. Some surgeons and pathologists report that the enlargement of multiple glands is common; double adenomas are reported. In ‵15% of patients, all glands are hyperfunctioning; chief cell parathyroid hyperplasia is usually hereditary and frequently associated with other endocrine abnormalities.

Hereditary Syndromes and Multiple Parathyroid Tumors

Hereditary hyperparathyroidism can occur without other endocrine abnormalities but is usually part of a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome (Chap. 351). MEN 1 (Wermer's syndrome) consists of hyperparathyroidism and tumors of the pituitary and pancreas, often associated with gastric hypersecretion and peptic ulcer disease (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). MEN 2A is characterized by pheochromocytoma and medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, as well as hyperparathyroidism; MEN 2B has additional associated features such as multiple neuromas but usually lacks hyperparathyroidism. Each of these MEN syndromes is transmitted in an apparent autosomal dominant manner, although, as noted below, the genetic basis of MEN 1 involves biallelic loss of a tumor suppressor.

The hyperparathyroidism jaw tumor (HPT-JT) syndrome occurs in families with parathyroid tumors (sometimes carcinomas) in association with benign jaw tumors. Some kindreds exhibit hereditary hyperparathyroidism without other endocrinopathies. This disorder is often termed nonsyndromic familial isolated hyperparathyroidism (FIHP). There is speculation that these families may be examples of variable expression of the other syndromes such as MEN 1, MEN 2, or the HPT-JT syndrome, but they may also have distinctive, still unidentified genetic causes.

Pathology

Adenomas are most often located in the inferior parathyroid glands, but in 6每10% of patients, parathyroid adenomas may be located in the thymus, the thyroid, the pericardium, or behind the esophagus. Adenomas are usually 0.5每5 g in size but may be as large as 10每20 g (normal glands weigh 25 mg on average). Chief cells are predominant in both hyperplasia and adenoma. With chief cell hyperplasia, the enlargement may be so asymmetric that some involved glands appear grossly normal. If generalized hyperplasia is present, however, histologic examination reveals a uniform pattern of chief cells and disappearance of fat even in the absence of an increase in gland weight. Thus, microscopic examination of biopsy specimens of several glands is essential to interpret findings at surgery.

Parathyroid carcinoma is often not aggressive. Long-term survival without recurrence is common if at initial surgery the entire gland is removed without rupture of the capsule. Recurrent parathyroid carcinoma is usually slow-growing with local spread in the neck, and surgical correction of recurrent disease may be feasible. Occasionally, however, parathyroid carcinoma is more aggressive, with distant metastases (lung, liver, and bone) found at the time of initial operation. It may be difficult to appreciate initially that a primary tumor is carcinoma; increased numbers of mitotic figures and increased fibrosis of the gland stroma may precede invasion. The diagnosis of carcinoma is often made in retrospect. Hyperparathyroidism from a parathyroid carcinoma may be indistinguishable from other forms of primary hyperparathyroidism but is usually more severe clinically. A potential clue to the diagnosis is offered by the degree of calcium elevation. Calcium values of 3.5每3.7 mmol/L (14每15 mg/dL) are frequent with carcinoma and may alert the surgeon to remove the abnormal gland with care to avoid capsular rupture. Recent findings concerning the genetic basis of parathyroid carcinoma (distinct from that of benign adenomas) indicate the need, in these kindreds, for family screening (see below).
 
Genetic Defects Associated with Hyperparathyroidism

As in many other types of neoplasia, two fundamental types of genetic defects have been identified in parathyroid gland tumors: (1) overactivity of protooncogenes and (2) loss of function of tumor-suppressor genes. The former, by definition, can lead to uncontrolled cellular growth and function by activation (gain-of-function mutation) of a single allele of the responsible gene, whereas the latter requires loss of function of both allelic copies. Biallelic loss of function of a tumor-suppressor gene is usually characterized by a germ-line defect (all cells) and an additional somatic deletion/ mutation in the tumor (Fig. 353-3).

A.Schematic diagram indicating molecular events in tumor susceptibility. The patient with the hereditary abnormality (multiple endocrine neoplasia, or MEN) is envisioned as having one defective gene inherited from the affected parent on chromosome 11, but one copy of the normal gene is present from the other parent. In the monoclonal tumor (benign tumor), a somatic event, here partial chromosomal deletion, removes the remaining normal gene from a cell. In nonhereditary tumors, two successive somatic mutations must occur, a process that takes a longer time. By either pathway, the cell, deprived of growth-regulating influence from this gene, has unregulated growth and becomes a tumor. A different genetic locus also involving loss of a tumor-suppressor gene termed HRPT2 is involved in the pathogenesis of parathyroid carcinoma. (From A Arnold: J Clin Endocrine Metab 77:1108, 1993.

Mutations in the MEN1 gene locus, encoding the protein MENIN, on chromosome 11q13 are responsible for causing MEN 1; the normal allele of this gene fits the definition of a tumor-suppressor gene. Inheritance of one mutated allele in this hereditary syndrome, followed by loss of the other allele via somatic cell mutation, leads to monoclonal expansion and tumor development. Also, in ‵15每20% of sporadic parathyroid adenomas, both alleles of the MEN1 locus on chromosome 11 are somatically deleted, implying that the same defect responsible for MEN 1 can also cause the sporadic disease (Fig. 353-3A). Consistent with the Knudson hypothesis for two-step neoplasia in certain inherited cancer syndromes (Chap. 83), the earlier onset of hyperparathyroidism in the hereditary syndromes reflects the need for only one mutational event to trigger the monoclonal outgrowth. In sporadic adenomas, typically occurring later in life, two different somatic events must occur before the MEN1 gene is silenced.

Other presumptive anti-oncogenes involved in hyperparathyroidism include a still unidentified gene mapped to chromosome 1p seen in 40% of sporadic parathyroid adenomas and a gene mapped to chromosome Xp11 in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism and renal failure, who progressed to "tertiary" hyperparathyroidism, now known to reflect monoclonal outgrowths within previously hyperplastic glands.

A more complex pattern, still incompletely resolved, arises with genetic defects and carcinoma of the parathyroids. This appears to be due to biallelic loss of a functioning copy of a gene, HRPT2 (or CDC73), originally identified as the cause of the HPT-JT syndrome. Several inactivating mutations have been identified in HRPT2 (located on chromosome 1q21-31), which encodes a 531-amino-acid protein called parafibromin. The responsible genetic mutations in HRPT2 appear to be necessary, but not sufficient, for parathyroid cancer.

In general, the detection of additional genetic defects in these parathyroid tumor每related syndromes and the variations seen in phenotypic expression/penetrance indicate the multiplicity of the genetic factors responsible. Nonetheless, the ability to detect the presence of the major genetic contributors has greatly aided a more informed management of family members of patients identified in the hereditary syndromes such as MEN 1, MEN 2, and HPT-JT.

An important contribution from studies on the genetic origin of parathyroid carcinoma has been the realization that the mutations involve a different pathway than that involved with the benign gland enlargements. Unlike the pathogenesis of genetic alterations seen in colon cancer, where lesions evolve from benign adenomas to malignant disease by progressive genetic changes, the alterations commonly seen in most parathyroid cancers (HRPT2 mutations) are infrequently seen in sporadic parathyroid adenomas.

Abnormalities at the Rb gene were the first to be noted in parathyroid cancer. The Rb gene, a tumor-suppressor gene located on chromosome 13q14, was initially associated with retinoblastoma but has since been implicated in other neoplasias, including parathyroid carcinoma. Early studies implicated allelic deletions of the Rb gene in many parathyroid carcinomas and decreased or absent expression of the Rb protein. However, because there are often large deletions in chromosome 13 that include many genes in addition to the Rb locus (with similar findings in some pituitary carcinomas), it remains possible that other tumor-suppressor genes on chromosome 13 may be playing a role in parathyroid carcinoma.

Study of the parathyroid cancers found in some patients with the HPT-JT syndrome has led to identification of a much larger role for mutations in the HRPT2 gene in most parathyroid carcinomas, including those that arise sporadically, without apparent association with the HPT-JT syndrome. Mutations in the coding region have been identified in 75每80% of all parathyroid cancers analyzed, leading to the conclusion that, with addition of presumed mutations in the noncoding regions, this genetic defect may be seen in essentially all parathyroid carcinomas. Of special importance was the discovery that, in some sporadic parathyroid cancers, germ-line mutations have been found; this, in turn, has led to careful investigation of the families of these patients and a new clinical indication for genetic testing in this setting.

Hypercalcemia occurring in family members (who are also found to have the germ-line mutations) can lead to the finding, at parathyroid surgery, of premalignant parathyroid tumors.

Overall, it seems there are multiple factors in parathyroid cancer, in addition to the HRPT2 and Rb gene, although the HRPT2 gene mutation is the most invariant abnormality. RET encodes a tyrosine kinase type receptor; specific inherited germ-line mutations lead to a constitutive activation of the receptor, thereby explaining the autosomal dominant mode of transmission and the relatively early onset of neoplasia. In the MEN 2 syndrome, the RET protooncogene may be responsible for the earliest disorder detected, the polyclonal disorder (C cell hyperplasia, which then is transformed into a clonal outgrowth〞a medullary carcinoma with the participation of other, still uncharacterized genetic defects).

In some parathyroid adenomas, activation of a protooncogene has been identified (Fig. 353-3B). A reciprocal translocation involving chromosome 11 has been identified that juxtaposes the PTH gene promoter upstream of a gene product termed PRAD-1, encoding a cyclin D protein that plays a key role in normal cell division. This translocation plus other mechanisms that cause an equivalent overexpression of cyclin D1 are found in 20每40% of parathyroid adenomas.

Mouse models have confirmed the role of several of the major identified genetic defects in parathyroid disease and the MEN syndromes. Loss of the MEN1 gene locus or overexpression of the PRAD-1 protooncogene or the mutated RET protooncogene have been analyzed by genetic manipulation in mice, with the expected onset of parathyroid tumors or medullary carcinoma, respectively.

Signs and Symptoms

One-half or more of patients with hyperparathyroidism are asymptomatic. In series in which patients are followed without operation, as many as 80% are classified as without symptoms. Manifestations of hyperparathyroidism involve primarily the kidneys and the skeletal system. Kidney involvement, due either to deposition of calcium in the renal parenchyma or to recurrent nephrolithiasis, was present in 60每70% of patients prior to 1970. With earlier detection, renal complications occur in <20% of patients in many large series. Renal stones are usually composed of either calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate. In occasional patients, repeated episodes of nephrolithiasis or the formation of large calculi may lead to urinary tract obstruction, infection, and loss of renal function. Nephrocalcinosis may also cause decreased renal function and phosphate retention.

The distinctive bone manifestation of hyperparathyroidism is osteitis fibrosa cystica, which occurred in 10每25% of patients in series reported 50 years ago. Histologically, the pathognomonic features are an increase in the giant multinucleated osteoclasts in scalloped areas on the surface of the bone (Howship's lacunae) and a replacement of the normal cellular and marrow elements by fibrous tissue. X-ray changes include resorption of the phalangeal tufts and replacement of the usually sharp cortical outline of the bone in the digits by an irregular outline (subperiosteal resorption). In recent years, osteitis fibrosa cystica is very rare in primary hyperparathyroidism, probably due to the earlier detection of the disease.

Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) of the spine provides reproducible quantitative estimates (within a few percent) of spinal bone density. Similarly, bone density in the extremities can be quantified by densitometry of the hip or of the distal radius at a site chosen to be primarily cortical. CT is a very sensitive technique for estimating spinal bone density, but reproducibility of standard CT is no better than 5%. Newer CT techniques (spiral, "extreme" CT) are more reproducible but are currently available in a limited number of medical centers. Cortical bone density is reduced while cancellous bone density, especially in the spine, is relatively preserved. In symptomatic patients, dysfunctions of the CNS, peripheral nerve and muscle, gastrointestinal tract, and joints also occur. It has been reported that severe neuropsychiatric manifestations may be reversed by parathyroidectomy. When present in symptomatic patients, neuromuscular manifestations may include proximal muscle weakness, easy fatigability, and atrophy of muscles and may be so striking as to suggest a primary neuromuscular disorder. The distinguishing feature is the complete regression of neuromuscular disease after surgical correction of the hyperparathyroidism.

Gastrointestinal manifestations are sometimes subtle and include vague abdominal complaints and disorders of the stomach and pancreas. Again, cause and effect are unclear. In MEN 1 patients with hyperparathyroidism, duodenal ulcer may be the result of associated pancreatic tumors that secrete excessive quantities of gastrin (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). Pancreatitis has been reported in association with hyperparathyroidism, but the incidence and the mechanism are not established.

Much attention has been paid in recent years to the manifestations of and optimum management strategies for asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism. This is now the most prevalent form of the disease. Asympomatatic primary hyperparathyroidism is defined as biochemically confirmed hyperparathyroidism (elevated or inappropriately normal PTH levels despite hypercalcemia) with the absence of signs and symptoms typically associated with more severe hyperparathyroidism such as features of renal or bone disease.

Three conferences on the topic have been held in the United States over the past two decades, with the most recent in 2008. The published proceedings include discussion of more subtle manifestations of disease, its natural history (without parathyroidectomy), and guidelines both for indications for surgery and medical monitoring in nonoperated patients.

Issues of concern include the potential for cardiovascular deterioration, the presence of subtle neuropsychiatric symptoms, and the longer-term status of skeletal integrity in patients not treated surgically. The current consensus is that medical monitoring rather than surgical correction of hyperparathyroidism may be justified in certain patients. The current recommendation is that patients who show mild disease, as defined by specific criteria (Table 353-2), can be safely followed under management guidelines (Table 353-3). There is, however, growing uncertainty about subtle disease manifestations and whether surgery is therefore indicated in most patients. Among the issues is the evidence of eventual (>8 years) deterioration in bone mineral density after a decade of relative stability. There is concern that this late-onset deterioration in bone density in nonoperated patients could contribute significantly to the well-known age-dependent fracture risk (osteoporosis). One study reported significant and sustained improvements in bone mineral density after successful parathyroidectomy, again raising the issue regarding benefits of surgery. Other randomized studies, however, did not report major gains post-surgery.

Cardiovascular disease including left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac functional defects, and endothelial dysfunction have been reported as reversible in European patients with more severe symptomatic disease after surgery, leading to numerous studies of these cardiovascular features in those with milder disease. There are reports of endothelial dysfunction in patients with mild asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism, but more observation is needed the expert panels concluded, especially whether there is reversibility with surgery.

A topic of considerable interest and some debate is assessment of neuropsychiatric status and health-related quality of life (QOL) status in hyperparathyroid patients both before surgery and in response to parathyroidectomy. Several observational studies suggest considerable improvements in symptom score after surgery. Randomized studies of surgery versus observation, however, have yielded inconclusive results, especially regarding benefits of surgery. Most studies report that hyperparathyroidism is associated with increased neuropsychiatric symptoms, so the issue remains a significant factor in decisions regarding the impact of surgery in this disease.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis is typically made by detecting an elevated immunoreactive PTH level in a patient with asymptomatic hypercalcemia (see "Differential Diagnosis: Special Tests," below). Serum phosphate is usually low but may be normal, especially if renal failure has developed.

Several modifications in PTH assays have been introduced in efforts to improve their utility in light of information about metabolism of PTH (as discussed above). First-generation assays were based on displacement of radiolabeled PTH from antibodies that reacted with PTH (often also PTH fragments). Double-antibody or immunometric assays (one antibody that is usually directed against the carboxyl-terminal portion of intact PTH to capture the hormone and a second radio- or enzyme-labeled antibody that is usually directed against the amino-terminal portion of intact PTH) greatly improved the diagnostic discrimination of the tests by eliminating interference from circulating biologically inactive fragments, detected by the original first-generation assays. Double-antibody assays are now referred to as second-generation. Such PTH assays have in some centers and testing laboratories been replaced by third-generation assays after it was discovered that large PTH fragments, devoid of only the extreme amino-terminal portion of the PTH molecule, are also present in blood and are detected, incorrectly as intact PTH. These amino-terminally truncated PTH fragments were prevented from registering in the newer third-generation assays by use of a detection antibody directed against the extreme amino-terminal epitope. These assays may be useful for clinical research studies as in management of chronic renal disease, but the consensus is that either second- or third-generation assays are useful in the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism and for the diagnosis of high-turnover bone disease in chronic kidney disease.

Many tests based on renal responses to excess PTH (renal calcium and phosphate clearance; blood phosphate, chloride, magnesium; urinary or nephrogenous cyclic AMP) were used in earlier decades. These tests have low specificity for hyperparathyroidism and are therefore not cost-effective; they have been replaced by PTH immunometric assays combined with simultaneous blood calcium measurements (Fig. 353-4).

Treatment: Hyperparathyroidism

Surgical excision of the abnormal parathyroid tissue is the definitive therapy for this disease. As noted above, medical surveillance without operation for patients with mild, asymptomatic disease is, however, still preferred by some physicians and patients, particularly when the patients are more elderly. Evidence favoring surgery, if medically feasible, is growing because of concerns about skeletal, cardiovascular, and neuropsychiatric disease, even in mild hyperparathyroidism.

Two surgical approaches are generally practiced. The conventional parathyroidectomy procedure was neck exploration with general anesthesia; this procedure is being replaced in many centers, whenever feasible, by an outpatient procedure with local anesthesia, termed minimally invasive parathyroidectomy.

Parathyroid exploration is challenging and should be undertaken by an experienced surgeon. Certain features help in predicting the pathology (e.g., multiple abnormal glands in familial cases). However, some critical decisions regarding management can be made only during the operation.

With conventional surgery, one approach is still based on the view that typically only one gland (the adenoma) is abnormal. If an enlarged gland is found, a normal gland should be sought. In this view, if a biopsy of a normal-sized second gland confirms its histologic (and presumed functional) normality, no further exploration, biopsy, or excision is needed. At the other extreme is the minority viewpoint that all four glands be sought and that most of the total parathyroid tissue mass be removed. The concern with the former approach is that the recurrence rate of hyperparathyroidism may be high if a second abnormal gland is missed; the latter approach could involve unnecessary surgery and an unacceptable rate of hypoparathyroidism. When normal glands are found in association with one enlarged gland, excision of the single adenoma usually leads to cure or at least years free of symptoms. Long-term follow-up studies to establish true rates of recurrence are limited.

Recently, there has been growing experience with new surgical strategies that feature a minimally invasive approach guided by improved preoperative localization and intraoperative monitoring by PTH assays. Preoperative 99mTc sestamibi scans with single-photon emission CT (SPECT) are used to predict the location of an abnormal gland and intraoperative sampling of PTH before and at 5-minute intervals after removal of a suspected adenoma to confirm a rapid fall (>50%) to normal levels of PTH. In several centers, a combination of preoperative sestamibi imaging, cervical block anesthesia, minimal surgical incision, and intraoperative PTH measurements has allowed successful outpatient surgical management with a clear-cut cost benefit compared to general anesthesia and more extensive neck surgery. The use of these minimally invasive approaches requires clinical judgment to select patients unlikely to have multiple gland disease (e.g., MEN or secondary hyperparathyroidism). The growing acceptance of the technique and its relative ease for the patient has lowered the threshold for surgery.

Usually the severity of the hypercalcemia provides a preoperative clue to parathyroid carcinoma. In such cases, when neck exploration is undertaken, the tissue should be widely excised; care is taken to avoid rupture of the capsule to prevent local seeding of tumor cells.

Multiple-gland hyperplasia, as predicted in familial cases, poses more difficult questions of surgical management. Once a diagnosis of hyperplasia is established, all the glands must be identified. Two schemes have been proposed for surgical management. One is to totally remove three glands with partial excision of the fourth gland; care is taken to leave a good blood supply for the remaining gland. Other surgeons advocate total parathyroidectomy with immediate transplantation of a portion of a removed, minced parathyroid gland into the muscles of the forearm, with the view that surgical excision is easier from the ectopic site in the arm if there is recurrent hyperfunction.

In a minority of cases, if no abnormal parathyroid glands are found in the neck, the issue of further exploration must be decided. There are documented cases of five or six parathyroid glands and of unusual locations for adenomas such as in the mediastinum.

When a second parathyroid exploration is indicated, the minimally invasive techniques for preoperative localization such as ultrasound, CT scan, and isotope scanning are combined with venous sampling and/or selective digital arteriography in one of the centers specializing in these procedures. Intraoperative monitoring of PTH levels by rapid PTH immunoassays may be useful in guiding the surgery. At one center, long-term cures have been achieved with selective embolization or injection of large amounts of contrast material into the end-arterial circulation feeding the parathyroid tumor.

A decline in serum calcium occurs within 24 hours after successful surgery; usually blood calcium falls to low-normal values for 3每5 days until the remaining parathyroid tissue resumes full hormone secretion. Acute postoperative hypocalcemia is likely only if severe bone mineral deficits are present or if injury to all the normal parathyroid glands occurs during surgery. In general, there are few problems encountered in patients with uncomplicated disease such as a single adenoma (the clear majority), who do not have symptomatic bone disease nor a large deficit in bone mineral, who are vitamin D and magnesium sufficient, and who have good renal and gastrointestinal function. The extent of postoperative hypocalcemia varies with the surgical approach. If all glands are biopsied, hypocalcemia may be transiently symptomatic and more prolonged. Hypocalcemia is more likely to be symptomatic after second parathyroid explorations, particularly when normal parathyroid tissue was removed at the initial operation and when the manipulation and/or biopsy of the remaining normal glands are more extensive in the search for the missing adenoma.

Patients with hyperparathyroidism have efficient intestinal calcium absorption due to the increased levels of 1,25(OH)2D stimulated by PTH excess. Once hypocalcemia signifies successful surgery, patients can be put on a high-calcium intake or be given oral calcium supplements. Despite mild hypocalcemia, most patients do not require parenteral therapy. If the serum calcium falls to <2 mmol/L (8 mg/dL), and if the phosphate level rises simultaneously, the possibility that surgery has caused hypoparathyroidism must be considered. With unexpected hypocalcemia, coexistent hypomagnesemia should be considered, as it interferes with PTH secretion and causes functional hypoparathyroidism (Chap. 352).

Signs of hypocalcemia include symptoms such as muscle twitching, a general sense of anxiety, and positive Chvostek's and Trousseau's signs coupled with serum calcium consistently <2 mmol/L (8 mg/dL). Parenteral calcium replacement at a low level should be instituted when hypocalcemia is symptomatic. The rate and duration of IV therapy are determined by the severity of the symptoms and the response of the serum calcium to treatment. An infusion of 0.5每2 mg/kg per hour or 30每100 mL/h of a 1-mg/mL solution usually suffices to relieve symptoms. Usually, parenteral therapy is required for only a few days. If symptoms worsen or if parenteral calcium is needed for >2每3 days, therapy with a vitamin D analogue and/or oral calcium (2每4 g/d) should be started (see below). It is cost-effective to use calcitriol (doses of 0.5每1 米g/d) because of the rapidity of onset of effect and prompt cessation of action when stopped, in comparison to other forms of vitamin D. A rise in blood calcium after several months of vitamin D replacement may indicate restoration of parathyroid function to normal. It is also appropriate to monitor serum PTH serially to estimate gland function in such patients.

If magnesium deficiency was present, it can complicate the postoperative course since magnesium deficiency impairs the secretion of PTH. Hypomagnesemia should be corrected whenever detected. Magnesium replacement can be effective orally (e.g., MgCl2, MgOH2), but parenteral repletion is usual to ensure postoperative recovery, if magnesium deficiency is suspected due to low blood magnesium levels. Because the depressant effect of magnesium on central and peripheral nerve functions does not occur at levels <2 mmol/L (normal range 0.8每1.2 mmol/L), parenteral replacement can be given rapidly. A cumulative dose as great as 0.5每1 mmol/kg of body weight can be administered if severe hypomagnesemia is present; often, however, total doses of 20每40 mmol are sufficient.

Medical Management

The guidelines for recommending surgical intervention, if feasible (Table 353-2), as well as for monitoring patients with asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism who elect not to undergo parathyroidectomy (Table 353-3), reflect the changes over time since the first conference on the topic in 1990. Medical monitoring rather than corrective surgery is still acceptable, but it is clear that surgical intervention is the more frequently recommended option for the reasons noted above. Tightened guidelines favoring surgery include lowering the recommended level of serum calcium elevation, more careful attention to skeletal integrity through reference to peak skeletal mass at baseline (T scores) rather than age-adjusted bone density (Z scores), as well as the presence of any fragility fracture. The other changes noted in the two guidelines (Tables 353-2 and 353-3) reflect accumulated experience and practical consideration, such as a difficulty in quantity of urine collections. Despite the usefulness of the guidelines, the importance of individual patient and physician judgment and preference are clear in all recommendations.

When surgery is not selected, or not medically feasible, there is interest in the potential value of specific medical therapies. There is no long-term experience regarding specific clinical outcomes such as fracture prevention, but it has been established that bisphosphonates increase bone mineral density significantly without changing serum calcium (as does estrogen, but the latter is not favored because of reported adverse effects in other organ systems). Calcimimetics that lower PTH secretion lower calcium but do not affect bone mass density (BMD).

Other Parathyroid-Related Causes of Hypercalcemia

Lithium Therapy

Lithium, used in the management of bipolar depression and other psychiatric disorders, causes hypercalcemia in ‵10% of treated patients. The hypercalcemia is dependent on continued lithium treatment, remitting and recurring when lithium is stopped and restarted. The parathyroid adenomas reported in some hypercalcemic patients with lithium therapy may reflect the presence of an independently occurring parathyroid tumor; a permanent effect of lithium on parathyroid gland growth need not be implicated as most patients have complete reversal of hypercalcemia when lithium is stopped. However, long-standing stimulation of parathyroid cell replication by lithium may predispose to development of adenomas (as is documented in secondary hyperparathyroidism and renal failure).

At the levels achieved in blood in treated patients, lithium can be shown in vitro to shift the PTH secretion curve to the right in response to calcium; i.e., higher calcium levels are required to lower PTH secretion, probably acting at the calcium sensor (see below). This effect can cause elevated PTH levels and consequent hypercalcemia in otherwise normal individuals. Fortunately, there are usually alternative medications for the underlying psychiatric illness. Parathyroid surgery should not be recommended unless hypercalcemia and elevated PTH levels persist after lithium is discontinued.

Genetic Disorders Causing Hyperparathyroid-Like Syndromes

Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia

FHH (also called familial benign hypercalcemia) is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Affected individuals are discovered because of asymptomatic hypercalcemia. FHH, which is caused by an inactivating mutation in a single allele of the calcium sensing receptor (see below), involves inappropriately normal or even increased secretion of PTH, whereas another hypercalcemic disorder, namely the exceedingly rare Jansen's disease, is caused by a constitutively active PTH/PTHrP receptor in target tissues. Neither FHH nor Jansen's disease, however, is a growth disorder of the parathyroids.

The pathophysiology of FHH is now understood. The primary defect is abnormal sensing of the blood calcium by the parathyroid gland and renal tubule, causing inappropriate secretion of PTH and excessive renal reabsorption of calcium. The calcium-sensing receptor is a member of the third family of GPCRs (type C, or III). The receptor responds to increased ECF calcium concentration by suppressing PTH secretion through second-messenger signaling, thereby providing negative-feedback regulation of PTH secretion. Many different inactivating mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor have been identified in patients with FHH. These mutations lower the capacity of the sensor to bind calcium, and the mutant receptors function as though blood calcium levels were low; excessive secretion of PTH occurs from an otherwise normal gland. Approximately two-thirds of patients with FHH have mutations within the protein-coding region of the gene. The remaining one-third of kindreds may have mutations in the gene promoter or may involve still unknown mechanisms in other regions of the genome identified through mapping studies (e.g., chromosome 19p and 19q).

Even before elucidation of the pathophysiology of FHH, abundant clinical evidence served to separate the disorder from primary hyperparathyroidism; these clinical features are still useful in differential diagnosis. Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have <99% renal calcium reabsorption, whereas most patients with FHH have >99% reabsorption. The hypercalcemia in FHH is often detectable in affected members of the kindreds in the first decade of life, whereas hypercalcemia rarely occurs in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism or the MEN syndromes who are aged <10 years. PTH may be elevated in FHH, but the values are usually normal or lower for the same degree of calcium elevation that is observed in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroid surgery performed in a few patients with FHH before the nature of the syndrome was understood led to permanent hypoparathyroidism; nevertheless, hypocalciuria persisted, establishing that hypocalciuria is not PTH-dependent (now known to be due to the abnormal calcium-sensing receptor in the kidney).

Few clinical signs or symptoms are present in patients with FHH, and other endocrine abnormalities are not present. Most patients are detected as a result of family screening after hypercalcemia is detected in a proband. In those patients inadvertently operated upon, the parathyroids appeared normal or moderately hyperplastic. Parathyroid surgery is not appropriate, nor, in view of the lack of symptoms, does medical treatment seem needed to lower the calcium. One striking exception to the rule against parathyroid surgery in this syndrome is the occurrence, usually in consanguineous marriages (due to the rarity of the gene mutation), of a homozygous or compound heterozygote state, resulting in severe impairment of calcium-sensing receptor function. In this condition, neonatal severe hypercalcemia, total parathyroidectomy is mandatory. Rare but well-documented cases of acquired hypocalciuric hypercalcemia are reported due to antibodies against the calcium-sensing receptor. They appear to be a complication of an underlying autoimmune disorder and respond to therapies directed against the underlying disorder.

Jansen's Disease

Activating mutations in the PTH/PTHrP receptor (PTH1R) have been identified as the cause of this rare autosomal dominant syndrome. Because the mutations lead to constitutive receptor function, one abnormal copy of the mutant receptor is sufficient to cause the disease, thereby accounting for its dominant mode of transmission. The disorder leads to short-limbed dwarfism due to abnormal regulation of chondrocyte maturation in the growth plates of the bone that are formed through an endochondral process. In adult life, there are numerous abnormalities in bone, including multiple cystic resorptive areas resembling those seen in severe hyperparathyroidism. Hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia with undetectable or low PTH levels are typically seen. The pathogenesis of the growth plate abnormalities in Jansen's disease has been confirmed by transgenic experiments in which targeted expression of the mutant PTH/PTHrP receptor to the proliferating chondrocyte layer of growth plate emulated several features of the human disorder. Figure 353-5 illustrates some of these genetic mutations in the parathyroid gland or PTH target cells that affect Ca2 metabolism.

Illustration of some genetic mutations that alter calcium metabolism by effects on the parathyroid cell or target cells of PTH action. Alterations in PTH production by the parathyroid cell can be caused by changes in the response to extracellular fluid calcium (Ca2+) that are detected by the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). Furthermore, PTH (or PTHrP) can show altered efficacy in target cells such as in proximal tubular cells, by altered function of its receptor (PTH/PTHrP receptor) or the signal transduction proteins, G proteins such as Gs汐 that is linked to adenylate cyclase (AC), the enzyme responsible for producing cyclic AMP (cAMP) [also illustrated is Gq, which activates an alternate pathway of receptor signal transmission involving the generation of inositol triphosphate (IP3) or diacylglycerol (DAG)]. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the CaSR cause familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FBHH) and homozygous mutations (both alleles mutated) and severe neonatal hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT); heterozygous gain-of-functions causes autosomal dominant hypercalciuric hypocalcemia (ADHH). Other defects in parathyroid cell function that occur at the level of gene regulation (oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes) or transcription factors are discussed in the text. Blomstrand's lethal chondrodysplasia is due to homozygous or compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the PTH/PTHrP receptor, a neonatally lethal disorder, while pseudohypoparathyroidism involves inactivation at the level of the G proteins, specifically mutations that eliminate or reduce Gs汐 activity in the kidney (see text for details). Jansen's metaphyseal chondrodysplasia and McCune-Albright syndrome represent gain-of-function mutations in the PTH/PTHrP receptor and Gs汐 protein, respectively.
 
 

Malignancy-Related Hypercalcemia

Clinical Syndromes and Mechanisms of Hypercalcemia

Hypercalcemia due to malignancy is common (occurring in as many as 20% of cancer patients, especially with certain types of tumor such as lung carcinoma), often severe and difficult to manage, and, on rare occasions, difficult to distinguish from primary hyperparathyroidism. Although malignancy is often clinically obvious or readily detectable by medical history, hypercalcemia can occasionally be due to an occult tumor. Previously, hypercalcemia associated with malignancy was thought to be due to local invasion and destruction of bone by tumor cells; many cases are now known to result from the elaboration by the malignant cells of humoral mediators of hypercalcemia. PTHrP is the responsible humoral agent in most solid tumors that cause hypercalcemia.

The histologic character of the tumor is more important than the extent of skeletal metastases in predicting hypercalcemia. Small cell carcinoma (oat cell) and adenocarcinoma of the lung, though the most common lung tumors associated with skeletal metastases, rarely cause hypercalcemia. By contrast, many patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung develop hypercalcemia. Histologic studies of bone in patients with squamous cell or epidermoid carcinoma of the lung, in sites invaded by tumor as well as areas remote from tumor invasion, reveal increased bone resorption.

Two main mechanisms of hypercalcemia are operative in cancer hypercalcemia. Many solid tumors associated with hypercalcemia, particularly squamous cell and renal tumors, produce and secrete PTHrP that causes increased bone resorption and mediate the hypercalcemia through systemic actions on the skeleton. Alternatively, direct bone marrow invasion occurs with hematologicmalignancies such as leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. Lymphokines and cytokines (including PTHrP) produced by cells involved in the marrow response to the tumors promote resorption of bone through local destruction. Several hormones, hormone analogues, cytokines, and growth factors have been implicated as the result of clinical assays, in vitro tests, or chemical isolation. The etiologic factor produced by activated normal lymphocytes and by myeloma and lymphoma cells, originally termed osteoclast activation factor, now appears to represent the biologic action of several different cytokines, probably interleukin 1 and lymphotoxin or tumor necrosis factor (TNF). In some lymphomas, there is a third mechanism, caused by an increased blood level of 1,25(OH)2D, produced by the abnormal lymphocytes.

In the more common mechanism, usually termed humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, solid tumors (cancers of the lung and kidney, in particular), in which bone metastases are absent, minimal, or not detectable clinically, secrete PTHrP measurable by immunoassay. Secretion by the tumors of the PTH-like factor, PTHrP, activates the PTH1R, resulting in a pathophysiology closely resembling hyperparathyroidism. The clinical picture resembles primary hyperparathyroidism (hypophosphatemia accompanies hypercalcemia), and elimination or regression of the primary tumor leads to disappearance of the hypercalcemia.

As in hyperparathyroidism, patients with the humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy have elevated urinary nephrogenous cyclic AMP excretion, hypophosphatemia, and increased urinary phosphate clearance. However, in humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, immunoreactive PTH is undetectable or suppressed, making the differential diagnosis easier. Other features of the disorder differ from those of true hyperparathyroidism. Although the biologic actions of PTH and PTHrP are exerted through the same receptor, subtle differences in receptor activation by the two ligands must account for some of the discordance in pathophysiology, when an excess of one or the other peptide occurs. Other cytokines elaborated by the malignancy may contribute to the variations from hyperparathyroidism in these patients as well. Patients with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy may have low to normal levels of 1,25(OH)2D instead of elevated levels as in true hyperparathyroidism. In some patients with the humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, osteoclastic resorption is unaccompanied by an osteoblastic or bone-forming response, implying inhibition of the normal coupling of bone formation and resorption.

Several different assays (single- or double-antibody, different epitopes) have been developed to detect PTHrP. Most data indicate that circulating PTHrP levels are undetectable (or low) in normal individuals except perhaps in pregnancy (high in human milk) and elevated in most cancer patients with the humoral syndrome. The etiologic mechanisms in cancer hypercalcemia may be multiple in the same patient. For example, in breast carcinoma (metastatic to bone) and in a distinctive type of T cell lymphoma/leukemia initiated by human T cell lymphotropic virus I, hypercalcemia is caused by direct local lysis of bone as well as by a humoral mechanism involving excess production of PTHrP. Hyperparathyroidism has been reported to coexist with the humoral cancer syndrome and, rarely, ectopic hyperparathyroidism due to tumor elaboration of true PTH is reported.

Diagnostic Issues

Levels of PTH measured by the double-antibody technique are undetectable or extremely low in tumor hypercalcemia, as would be expected with the mediation of the hypercalcemia by a factor other than PTH (the hypercalcemia suppresses the normal parathyroid glands). In a patient with minimal symptoms referred for hypercalcemia, low or undetectable PTH levels would focus attention on a possible occult malignancy (except for very rare cases of ectopic hyperparathyroidism).

Ordinarily, the diagnosis of cancer hypercalcemia is not difficult because tumor symptoms are prominent when hypercalcemia is detected. Indeed, hypercalcemia may be noted incidentally during the workup of a patient with known or suspected malignancy. Clinical suspicion that malignancy is the cause of the hypercalcemia is heightened when there are other signs or symptoms of a paraneoplastic process such as weight loss, fatigue, muscle weakness, or unexplained skin rash, or when symptoms specific for a particular tumor are present. Squamous cell tumors are most frequently associated with hypercalcemia, particularly tumors of the lung, kidney, head and neck, and urogenital tract. Radiologic examinations can focus on these areas when clinical evidence is unclear. Bone scans with technetium-labeled bisphosphonate are useful for detection of osteolytic metastases; the sensitivity is high, but specificity is low; results must be confirmed by conventional x-rays to be certain that areas of increased uptake are due to osteolytic metastases per se. Bone marrow biopsies are helpful in patients with anemia or abnormal peripheral blood smears.

Treatment: Malignancy-Related Hypercalcemia

Treatment of the hypercalcemia of malignancy is first directed to control of tumor; reduction of tumor mass usually corrects hypercalcemia. If a patient has severe hypercalcemia yet has a good chance for effective tumor therapy, treatment of the hypercalcemia should be vigorous while awaiting the results of definitive therapy. If hypercalcemia occurs in the late stages of a tumor that is resistant to antitumor therapy, the treatment of the hypercalcemia should be judicious as high calcium levels can have a mild sedating effect. Standard therapies for hypercalcemia (discussed below) are applicable to patients with malignancy.

Vitamin D每Related Hypercalcemia

Hypercalcemia caused by vitamin D can be due to excessive ingestion or abnormal metabolism of the vitamin. Abnormal metabolism of the vitamin is usually acquired in association with a widespread granulomatous disorder. Vitamin D metabolism is carefully regulated, particularly the activity of renal 1汐-hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for the production of 1,25(OH)2D (Chap. 352). The regulation of 1汐-hydroxylase and the normal feedback suppression by 1,25(OH)2D seem to work less well in infants than in adults and to operate poorly, if at all, in sites other than the renal tubule; these phenomena may explain the occurrence of hypercalcemia secondary to excessive 1,25(OH)2D3 production in infants with Williams' syndrome (see below) and in adults with sarcoidosis or lymphoma.

Vitamin D Intoxication

Chronic ingestion of 40每100 times the normal physiologic requirement of vitamin D (amounts >40,000每100,000 U/d) is usually required to produce significant hypercalcemia in normal individuals. The stated upper limit of safe dietary intake is 2000 U/d (50 米g/d) in adults because of concerns about potential toxic effects of cumulative supraphysiologic doses. These recommendations are now regarded as too restrictive, since some estimates are that in elderly individuals in northern latitudes, 2000 U/daily or more may be necessary to avoid vitamin D insufficiency.

Hypercalcemia in vitamin D intoxication is due to an excessive biologic action of the vitamin, perhaps the consequence of increased levels of 25(OH)D rather than merely increased levels of the active metabolite 1,25(OH)2D (the latter may not be elevated in vitamin D intoxication). 25(OH)D has definite, if low, biologic activity in the intestine and bone. The production of 25(OH)D is less tightly regulated than is the production of 1,25(OH)2D. Hence concentrations of 25(OH)D are elevated severalfold in patients with excess vitamin D intake.

The diagnosis is substantiated by documenting elevated levels of 25(OH)D >100 mg/mL. Hypercalcemia is usually controlled by restriction of dietary calcium intake and appropriate attention to hydration. These measures, plus discontinuation of vitamin D, usually lead to resolution of hypercalcemia. However, vitamin D stores in fat may be substantial, and vitamin D intoxication may persist for weeks after vitamin D ingestion is terminated. Such patients are responsive to glucocorticoids, which in doses of 100 mg/d of hydrocortisone or its equivalent usually return serum calcium levels to normal over several days; severe intoxication may require intensive therapy.

Sarcoidosis and Other Granulomatous Diseases

In patients with sarcoidosis and other granulomatous diseases, such as tuberculosis and fungal infections, excess 1,25(OH)2D is synthesized in macrophages or other cells in the granulomas. Indeed, increased 1,25(OH)2D levels have been reported in anephric patients with sarcoidosis and hypercalcemia. Macrophages obtained from granulomatous tissue convert 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D at an increased rate. There is a positive correlation in patients with sarcoidosis between 25(OH)D levels (reflecting vitamin D intake) and the circulating concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D, whereas normally there is no increase in 1,25(OH)2D with increasing 25(OH)D levels due to multiple feedback controls on renal 1汐-hydroxylase (Chap. 352). The usual regulation of active metabolite production by calcium and phosphate or by PTH does not operate in these patients. Clearance of 1,25(OH)2D from blood may be decreased in sarcoidosis as well. PTH levels are usually low and 1,25(OH)2D levels are elevated, but primary hyperparathyroidism and sarcoidosis may coexist in some patients.

Management of the hypercalcemia can often be accomplished by avoiding excessive sunlight exposure and limiting vitamin D and calcium intake. Presumably, however, the abnormal sensitivity to vitamin D and abnormal regulation of 1,25(OH)2D synthesis will persist as long as the disease is active. Alternatively, glucocorticoids in the equivalent of 100 mg/d of hydrocortisone or equivalent doses of glucorticoids may help control hypercalcemia. Glucocorticoids appear to act by blocking excessive production of 1,25(OH)2D, as well as the response to it in target organs.

Idiopathic Hypercalcemia of Infancy

This rare disorder, usually referred to as Williams' syndrome, is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple congenital development defects, including supravalvular aortic stenosis, mental retardation, and an elfin facies, in association with hypercalcemia due to abnormal sensitivity to vitamin D. The hypercalcemia associated with the syndrome was first recognized in England after fortification of milk with vitamin D. The cardiac and developmental abnormalities were independently described, but the connection between these defects and hypercalcemia were not described until later. Levels of 1,25(OH)2D can be elevated, ranging from 46 to 120 nmol/L (150每500 pg/mL). The mechanism of the abnormal sensitivity to vitamin D and of the increased circulating levels of 1,25(OH)2D is still unclear. Studies suggest that genetic mutations involving microdeletions at the elastin locus and perhaps other genes on chromosome 7 may play a role in the pathogenesis.

Hypercalcemia Associated with High Bone Turnover

Hyperthyroidism

As many as 20% of hyperthyroid patients have high-normal or mildly elevated serum calcium concentrations; hypercalciuria is even more common. The hypercalcemia is due to increased bone turnover, with bone resorption exceeding bone formation. Severe calcium elevations are not typical, and the presence of such suggests a concomitant disease such as hyperparathyroidism. Usually, the diagnosis is obvious, but signs of hyperthyroidism may occasionally be occult, particularly in the elderly (Chap. 341). Hypercalcemia is managed by treatment of the hyperthyroidism. Reports that thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) itself normally has a bone-protective effect suggest that suppressed TSH levels also play a role in hypercalcemia.

Immobilization

Immobilization is a rare cause of hypercalcemia in adults in the absence of an associated disease but may cause hypercalcemia in children and adolescents, particularly after spinal cord injury and paraplegia or quadriplegia. With resumption of ambulation, the hypercalcemia in children usually returns to normal.

The mechanism appears to involve a disproportion between bone formation and bone resorption; the former decreased and the latter increased. Hypercalciuria and increased mobilization of skeletal calcium can develop in normal volunteers subjected to extensive bed rest, although hypercalcemia is unusual. Immobilization of an adult with a disease associated with high bone turnover, however, such as Paget's disease, may cause hypercalcemia.

Thiazides

Administration of benzothiadiazines (thiazides) can cause hypercalcemia in patients with high rates of bone turnover such as patients with hypoparathyroidism treated with high doses of vitamin D. Traditionally, thiazides are associated with aggravation of hypercalcemia in primary hyperparathyroidism, but this effect can be seen in other high-bone-turnover states as well. The mechanism of thiazide action is complex. Chronic thiazide administration leads to reduction in urinary calcium; the hypocalciuric effect appears to reflect the enhancement of proximal tubular resorption of sodium and calcium in response to sodium depletion. Some of this renal effect is due to augmentation of PTH action and is more pronounced in individuals with intact PTH secretion. However, thiazides cause hypocalciuria in hypoparathyroid patients on high-dose vitamin D and oral calcium replacement if sodium intake is restricted. This finding is the rationale for the use of thiazides as an adjunct to therapy in hypoparathyroid patients, as discussed below. Thiazide administration to normal individuals causes a transient increase in blood calcium (usually within the high-normal range) that reverts to preexisting levels after a week or more of continued administration. If hormonal function and calcium and bone metabolism are normal, homeostatic controls are reset to counteract the calcium-elevating effect of the thiazides. In the presence of hyperparathyroidism or increased bone turnover from another cause, homeostatic mechanisms are ineffective. The abnormal effects of the thiazide on calcium metabolism disappear within days of cessation of the drug.

Vitamin A Intoxication

Vitamin Aintoxication is a rare cause of hypercalcemia and is most commonly a side effect of dietary faddism (Chap. 74). Calcium levels can be elevated into the 3每3.5-mmol/L (12每14 mg/dL) range after the ingestion of 50,000每100,000 units of vitamin A daily (10每20 times the minimum daily requirement). Typical features of severe hypercalcemia include fatigue, anorexia, and, in some, severe muscle and bone pain. Excess vitamin A intake is presumed to increase bone resorption.

The diagnosis can be established by history and by measurement of vitamin A levels in serum. Occasionally, skeletal x-rays reveal periosteal calcifications, particularly in the hands. Withdrawal of the vitamin is usually associated with prompt disappearance of the hypercalcemia and reversal of the skeletal changes. As in vitamin Dintoxication, administration of 100 mg/d hydrocortisone or its equivalent leads to a rapid return of the serum calcium to normal.

Hypercalcemia Associated with Renal Failure

Severe Secondary Hyperparathyroidism

The pathogenesis of secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease is incompletely understood. Resistance to the normal level of PTH is a major factor contributing to the development of hypocalcemia, which, in turn, is a stimulus to parathyroid gland enlargement. However, recent findings have indicated that an increase of FGF23 production by osteocytes (and possibly osteoblasts) in bone occurs well before an elevation in PTH is detected. FGF23 is a potent inhibitor of the renal 1-alpha hydroxylase, and the FGF23-dependent reduction in 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D may be an important stimulus for the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs not only in patients with renal failure but also in those with osteomalacia due to multiple causes (Chap. 352), including deficiency of vitamin D action and PHP (deficient response to PTH at the level of the receptor). For both disorders, hypocalcemia seems to be the common denominator in initiating the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Primary (1∼) and secondary (2∼) hyperparathyroidism can be distinguished conceptually by the autonomous growth of the parathyroid glands in primary hyperparathyroidism (presumably irreversible) and the adaptive response of the parathyroids in secondary hyperparathyroidism (typically reversible). In fact, reversal over weeks from an abnormal pattern of secretion, presumably accompanied by involution of parathyroid gland mass to normal, occurs in patients with osteomalacia who have been treated effectively with calcium and vitamin D. However, it is now recognized that a true clonal outgrowth (irreversible) can arise in long-standing, inadequately treated chronic renal failure [e.g., tertiary (3∼) hyperparathyroidism; see below].

Patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism may develop bone pain, ectopic calcification, and pruritus. The bone disease seen in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism and chronic kidney disease is termed renal osteodystrophy and affects primarily bone turnover. However, osteomalacia is frequently encountered as well and may be related to the circulating levels of FGF23.

Two other skeletal disorders have been frequently associated in the past with CKD patients treated by long-term dialysis who received aluminum-containing phosphate binders. Aluminum deposition in bone (see below) leads to an osteomalacia-like picture. The other entity is a low-bone-turnover state termed "aplastic" or "adynamic" bone disease; PTH levels are lower than typically observed in CKD patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. It is believed that the condition is caused, at least in part, by excessive PTH suppression, which may be even greater than previously appreciated in light of evidence that some of the immunoreactive PTH detected by most commercially available PTH assays is not the full-length biologically active molecule (as discussed above) but may consist of amino-terminally truncated fragments that do not activate the PTH1R.

Treatment: Secondary Hyperparathyroidism

Medical therapy to reverse secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD includes reduction of excessive blood phosphate by restriction of dietary phosphate, the use of nonabsorbable antacids, and careful, selective addition of calcitriol (0.25每2 米g/d) or related analogues. Calcium carbonate became preferred over aluminum-containing antacids to prevent aluminum-induced bone disease. However, synthetic gels that also bind phosphate (such as sevelamer; Chap. 280) are now widely used, with the advantage of avoiding not only aluminum retention but excess calcium elevation. Intravenous calcitriol (or related analogues), administered as several pulses each week, helps control secondary hyperparathyroidism. Aggressive but carefully administered medical therapy can often, but not always, reverse hyperparathyroidism and its symptoms and manifestations.

Occasional patients develop severe manifestations of secondary hyperparathyroidism, including hypercalcemia, pruritus, extraskeletal calcifications, and painful bones, despite aggressive medical efforts to suppress the hyperparathyroidism. PTH hypersecretion no longer responsive to medical therapy, a state of severe hyperparathyroidism in patients with renal failure that requires surgery, has been referred to as tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroid surgery is necessary to control this condition. Based on genetic evidence from examination of tumor samples in these patients, the emergence of autonomous parathyroid function is due to a monoclonal outgrowth of one or more previously hyperplastic parathyroid glands. The adaptive response has become an independent contributor to disease; this finding seems to emphasize the importance of optimal medical management to reduce the proliferative response of the parathyroid cells that enables the irreversible genetic change.

Aluminum Intoxication

Aluminum intoxication (and often hypercalcemia as a complication of medical treatment) in the past occurred in patients on chronic dialysis; manifestations included acute dementia and unresponsive and severe osteomalacia. Bone pain, multiple nonhealing fractures, particularly of the ribs and pelvis, and a proximal myopathy occur. Hypercalcemia develops when these patients are treated with vitamin D or calcitriol because of impaired skeletal responsiveness. Aluminum is present at the site of osteoid mineralization, osteoblastic activity is minimal, and calcium incorporation into the skeleton is impaired. The disorder is now rare because of the avoidance of aluminum-containing antacids or aluminum excess in the dialysis regimen (Chap. 360).

Milk-Alkali Syndrome

The milk-alkali syndrome is due to excessive ingestion of calcium and absorbable antacids such as milk or calcium carbonate. It is much less frequent since proton-pump inhibitors and other treatments became available for peptic ulcer disease. For a time, the increased use of calcium carbonate in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism led to reappearance of the syndrome. Several clinical presentations〞acute, subacute, and chronic〞have been described, all of which feature hypercalcemia, alkalosis, and renal failure. The chronic form of the disease, termed Burnett's syndrome, is associated with irreversible renal damage. The acute syndromes reverse if the excess calcium and absorbable alkali are stopped.

Individual susceptibility is important in the pathogenesis, as some patients are treated with calcium carbonate and alkali regimens without developing the syndrome. One variable is the fractional calcium absorption as a function of calcium intake. Some individuals absorb a high fraction of calcium, even with intakes ≡2 g of elemental calcium per day, instead of reducing calcium absorption with high intake, as occurs in most normal individuals. Resultant mild hypercalcemia after meals in such patients is postulated to contribute to the generation of alkalosis. Development of hypercalcemia causes increased sodium excretion and some depletion of total-body water. These phenomena and perhaps some suppression of endogenous PTH secretion due to mild hypercalcemia lead to increased bicarbonate resorption and to alkalosis in the face of continued calcium carbonate ingestion. Alkalosis per se selectively enhances calcium resorption in the distal nephron, thus aggravating the hypercalcemia. The cycle of mild hypercalcemia ↙ bicarbonate retention ↙ alkalosis ↙ renal calcium retention ↙ severe hypercalcemia perpetuates and aggravates hypercalcemia and alkalosis as long as calcium and absorbable alkali are ingested.

Differential Diagnosis: Special Tests

Differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia is best achieved by using clinical criteria, but immunometric assays to measure PTH is especially useful in distinguishing among major causes (Fig. 353-6). The clinical features that deserve emphasis are the presence or absence of symptoms or signs of disease and evidence of chronicity. If one discounts fatigue or depression, >90% of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have asymptomatic hypercalcemia; symptoms of malignancy are usually present in cancer-associated hypercalcemia. Disorders other than hyperparathyroidism and malignancy cause <10% of cases of hypercalcemia, and some of the nonparathyroid causes are associated with clear-cut manifestations such as renal failure.

Hyperparathyroidism is the likely diagnosis in patients with chronic hypercalcemia. If hypercalcemia has been manifest for >1 year, malignancy can usually be excluded as the cause. A striking feature of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia is the rapidity of the course, whereby signs and symptoms of the underlying malignancy are evident within months of the detection of hypercalcemia. Although clinical considerations are helpful in arriving at the correct diagnosis of the cause of hypercalcemia, appropriate laboratory testing is essential for definitive diagnosis. The immunoassay for PTH usually separates hyperparathyroidism from all other causes of hypercalcemia. There are very rare reports of ectopic production of excess PTH by nonparathyroid tumors. Patients with hyperparathyroidism have elevated PTH levels despite hypercalcemia, whereas patients with malignancy and the other causes of hypercalcemia (except for disorders mediated by PTH such as lithium-induced hypercalcemia) have levels of hormone below normal or undetectable. Assays based on the double-antibody method for PTH exhibit very high sensitivity (especially if serum calcium is simultaneously evaluated) and specificity for the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism (Fig. 353-4).

In summary, PTH values are elevated in >90% of parathyroid-related causes of hypercalcemia, undetectable or low in malignancy-related hypercalcemia, and undetectable or normal in vitamin D每related and high-bone-turnover causes of hypercalcemia. In view of the specificity of the PTH immunoassay and the high frequency of hyperparathyroidism in hypercalcemic patients, it is cost-effective to measure the PTH level in all hypercalcemic patients unless malignancy or a specific nonparathyroid disease is obvious. False-positive PTH assay results are rare. Immunoassays for PTHrP are helpful in diagnosing certain types of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia. Although FHH is parathyroid-related, the disease should be managed distinctively from hyperparathyroidism. Clinical features and the low urinary calcium excretion can help make the distinction. Because the incidence of malignancy and hyperparathyroidism both increase with age, they can coexist as two independent causes of hypercalcemia.

1,25(OH)2D levels are elevated in many (but not all) patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. In other disorders associated with hypercalcemia, concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D are low or, at the most, normal. However, this test is of low specificity and is not cost-effective, as not all patients with hyperparathyroidism have elevated 1,25(OH)2D levels and not all nonparathyroid hypercalcemic patients have suppressed 1,25(OH)2D. Measurement of 1,25(OH)2D is, however, critically valuable in establishing the cause of hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis and certain lymphomas.

A useful general approach is outlined in Fig. 353-6. If the patient is asymptomatic and there is evidence of chronicity to the hypercalcemia, hyperparathyroidism is almost certainly the cause. If PTH levels (usually measured at least twice) are elevated, the clinical impression is confirmed and little additional evaluation is necessary. If there is only a short history or no data as to the duration of the hypercalcemia, occult malignancy must be considered; if the PTH levels are not elevated, then a thorough workup must be undertaken for malignancy, including chest x-ray, CT of chest and abdomen, and bone scan. Immunoassays for PTHrP may be especially useful in such situations. Attention should also be paid to clues for underlying hematologic disorders such as anemia, increased plasma globulin, and abnormal serum immunoelectrophoresis; bone scans can be negative in some patients with metastases such as in multiple myeloma. Finally, if a patient with chronic hypercalcemia is asymptomatic and malignancy therefore seems unlikely on clinical grounds, but PTH values are not elevated, it is useful to search for other chronic causes of hypercalcemia such as occult sarcoidosis. A careful history of dietary supplements and drug use may suggest intoxication with vitamin D or vitamin A or the use of thiazides.

Treatment: Hypercalcemic States

The approach to medical treatment of hypercalcemia varies with its severity (Table 353-4). Mild hypercalcemia, <3 mmol/L (12 mg/dL), can be managed by hydration. More severe hypercalcemia [levels of 3.2每3.7 mmol/L (13每15 mg/dL)] must be managed aggressively; above that level, hypercalcemia can be life-threatening and requires emergency measures. By using a combination of approaches in severe hypercalcemia, the serum calcium concentration can be decreased by 0.7每2.2 mmol/L (3每9 mg/dL) within 24每48 hours in most patients, enough to relieve acute symptoms, prevent death from hypercalcemic crisis, and permit diagnostic evaluation. Therapy can then be directed at the underlying disorder〞the second priority.

Hypercalcemia develops because of excessive skeletal calcium release, increased intestinal calcium absorption, or inadequate renal calcium excretion. Understanding the particular pathogenesis helps guide therapy. For example, hypercalcemia in patients with malignancy is primarily due to excessive skeletal calcium release and is, therefore, minimally improved by restriction of dietary calcium. On the other hand, patients with vitamin D hypersensitivity or vitamin Dintoxication have excessive intestinal calcium absorption, and restriction of dietary calcium is beneficial. Decreased renal function or ECF depletion decreases urinary calcium excretion. In such situations, rehydration may rapidly reduce or reverse the hypercalcemia, even though increased bone resorption persists. As outlined below, the more severe the hypercalcemia, the greater the number of combined therapies that should be used. Rapid acting (hours) approaches〞rehydration, forced diuresis, and calcitonin〞can be used with the most effective antiresorptive agents such as bisphosphonates (since severe hypercalcemia usually involves excessive bone resorption).

Hydration, Increased Salt Intake, Mild and Forced Diuresis

The first principle of treatment is to restore normal hydration. Many hypercalcemic patients are dehydrated because of vomiting, inanition, and/or hypercalcemia-induced defects in urinary concentrating ability. The resultant drop in glomerular filtration rate is accompanied by an additional decrease in renal tubular sodium and calcium clearance. Restoring a normal ECF volume corrects these abnormalities and increases urine calcium excretion by 2.5每7.5 mmol/d (100每300 mg/d). Increasing urinary sodium excretion to 400每500 mmol/d increases urinary calcium excretion even further than simple rehydration. After rehydration has been achieved, saline can be administered or furosemide or ethacrynic acid can be given twice daily to depress the tubular reabsorptive mechanism for calcium (care must be taken to prevent dehydration). The combined use of these therapies can increase urinary calcium excretion to ≡12.5 mmol/d (500 mg/d) in most hypercalcemic patients. Since this is a substantial percentage of the exchangeable calcium pool, the serum calcium concentration usually falls 0.25每0.75 mmol/L (1每3 mg/dL) within 24 hours. Precautions should be taken to prevent potassium and magnesium depletion; calcium-containing renal calculi are a potential complication.

Under life-threatening circumstances, the preceding approach can be pursued more aggressively, but the availability of effective agents to block bone resorption (such as bisphosphonates) has reduced the need for extreme diuresis regimens (Table 353-5). Depletion of potassium and magnesium is inevitable unless replacements are given; pulmonary edema can be precipitated. The potential complications can be reduced by careful monitoring of central venous pressure and plasma or urine electrolytes; catheterization of the bladder may be necessary. Dialysis treatment may be needed when renal function is compromised.

Bisphosphonates

The bisphosphonates are analogues of pyrophosphate, with high affinity for bone, especially in areas of increased bone turnover, where they are powerful inhibitors of bone resorption. These bone-seeking compounds are stable in vivo because phosphatase enzymes cannot hydrolyze the central carbon-phosphorus-carbon bond. The bisphosphonates are concentrated in areas of high bone turnover and are taken up by and inhibit osteoclast action; the mechanism of action is complex. The bisphosphonate molecules that contain amino groups in the side chain structure (see below) interfere with prenylation of proteins and can lead to cellular apoptosis. The highly active nonamino group每containing bisphosphonates are also metabolized to cytotoxic products.

The initial bisphosphonate widely used in clinical practice, etidronate, was effective but had several disadvantages, including the capacity to inhibit bone formation as well as blocking resorption. Subsequently, a number of second- or third-generation compounds have become the mainstays of antiresorptive therapy for treatment of hypercalcemia and osteoporosis. The newer bisphosphonates have a highly favorable ratio of blocking resorption versus inhibiting bone formation; they inhibit osteoclast-mediated skeletal resorption yet do not cause mineralization defects at ordinary doses. Though the bisphosphonates have similar structures, the routes of administration, efficacy, toxicity, and side effects vary. The potency of the compounds for inhibition of bone resorption varies more than 10,000-fold, increasing in the order of etidronate, tiludronate, pamidronate, alendronate, risedronate, and zolendronate. The IV use of pamidronate and zolendronate is approved for the treatment of hypercalcemia; between 30 and 90 mg pamidronate, given as a single IV dose over a few hours, returns serum calcium to normal within 24每48 hours with an effect that lasts for weeks in 80每100% of patients. Zolendronate given in doses of 4 or 8 mg/5-minute infusion has a more rapid and more sustained effect than pamidronate in direct comparison.

These drugs are used extensively in cancer patients. Absolute survival improvements are noted with pamidronate and zolendronate in multiple myeloma, for example. However, though still rare, there are increasing reports of jaw necrosis, especially after dental surgery, mainly in cancer patients treated with multiple doses of the more potent bisphosphonates.

Calcitonin

Calcitonin acts within a few hours of its administration, principally through receptors on osteoclasts, to block bone resorption. Calcitonin, after 24 hours of use, is no longer effective in lowering calcium. Tachyphylaxis, a known phenomenon with this drug, seems to explain the results, since the drug is often effective in the first 24 hours of use. Therefore, in life-threatening hypercalcemia, calcitonin can be used effectively within the first 24 hours in combination with rehydration and saline diuresis while waiting for more sustained effects from a simultaneously administered bisphosphonate such as pamidronate. Usual doses of calcitonin are 2每8 U/kg of body weight IV, SC, or IM every 6每12 hours.

Other Therapies

Plicamycin (formerly mithramycin), which inhibits bone resorption, has been a useful therapeutic agent but is now seldom used because of its toxicity and the effectiveness of bisphosphonates. Plicamycin must be given IV, either as a bolus or by slow infusion; the usual dose is 25 米g/kg body weight. Gallium nitrate exerts a hypocalcemic action by inhibiting bone resorption and altering the structure of bone crystals. It is not often used now because of superior alternatives.

Glucocorticoids have utility, especially in hypercalcemia complicating certain malignancies. They increase urinary calcium excretion and decrease intestinal calcium absorption when given in pharmacologic doses, but they also cause negative skeletal calcium balance. In normal individuals and in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, glucocorticoids neither increase nor decrease the serum calcium concentration. In patients with hypercalcemia due to certain osteolytic malignancies, however, glucocorticoids may be effective as a result of antitumor effects. The malignancies in which hypercalcemia responds to glucocorticoids include multiple myeloma, leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, other lymphomas, and carcinoma of the breast, at least early in the course of the disease. Glucocorticoids are also effective in treating hypercalcemia due to vitamin D intoxication and sarcoidosis. Glucocorticoids are also useful in the rare form of hypercalcemia, now recognized in certain autoimmune disorders in which inactivating antibodies against the receptor imitate FHH. Elevated PTH and calcium levels are effectively lowered by the glucocorticoids. In all the preceding situations, the hypocalcemic effect develops over several days, and the usual glucocorticoid dosage is 40每100 mg prednisone (or its equivalent) daily in four divided doses. The side effects of chronic glucocorticoid therapy may be acceptable in some circumstances.

Dialysis is often the treatment of choice for severe hypercalcemia complicated by renal failure, which is difficult to manage medically. Peritoneal dialysis with calcium-free dialysis fluid can remove 5每12.5 mmol (200每500 mg) of calcium in 24每48 hours and lower the serum calcium concentration by 0.7每3 mmol/L (3每12 mg/dL). Large quantities of phosphate are lost during dialysis, and serum inorganic phosphate concentration usually falls, potentially aggravating hypercalcemia. Therefore, the serum inorganic phosphate concentration should be measured after dialysis, and phosphate supplements should be added to the diet or to dialysis fluids if necessary.

Phosphate therapy, PO or IV, has a limited role in certain circumstances (Chap. 352). Correcting hypophosphatemia lowers the serum calcium concentration by several mechanisms, including bone/calcium exchange. The usual oral treatment is 1每1.5 g phosphorus per day for several days, given in divided doses. It is generally believed, but not established, that toxicity does not occur if therapy is limited to restoring serum inorganic phosphate concentrations to normal.

Raising the serum inorganic phosphate concentration above normal decreases serum calcium levels, sometimes strikingly. Intravenous phosphate is one of the most dramatically effective treatments available for severe hypercalcemia but is toxic and even dangerous (fatal hypocalcemia). For these reasons, it is used rarely and only in severely hypercalcemic patients with cardiac or renal failure where dialysis, the preferable alternative, is not feasible or is unavailable.

Summary

The various therapies for hypercalcemia are listed in Table 353-4. The choice depends on the underlying disease, the severity of the hypercalcemia, the serum inorganic phosphate level, and the renal, hepatic, and bone marrow function. Mild hypercalcemia [3 mmol/L (12 mg/dL)] can usually be managed by hydration. Severe hypercalcemia [≡3.7 mmol/L (15 mg/dL)] requires rapid correction. Calcitonin should be given for its rapid, albeit short-lived, blockade of bone resorption, and IV pamidronate or zolendronate should be administered, although its onset of action is delayed for 1每2 days. In addition, for the first 24每48 hours, aggressive sodium-calciumdiuresis with IV saline should be given and, following rehydration, large doses of furosemide or ethacrynic acid, but only if appropriate monitoring is available and cardiac and renal function are adequate. Otherwise, dialysis may be necessary. Intermediate degrees of hypercalcemia between 3 and 3.7 mmol/L (12 and 15 mg/dL) should be approached with vigorous hydration and then the most appropriate selection for the patient of the combinations used with severe hypercalcemia.
 
Hypocalcemia

(See also Chap. 46)

Pathophysiology of Hypocalcemia: Classification Based on Mechanism

Chronic hypocalcemia is less common than hypercalcemia; causes include chronic renal failure, hereditary and acquired hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, PHP, and hypomagnesemia.

Acute rather than chronic hypocalcemia is seen in critically ill patients or as a consequence of certain medications and often does not require specific treatment. Transient hypocalcemia is seen with severe sepsis, burns, acute renal failure, and extensive transfusions with citrated blood. Although as many as one-half of patients in an intensive care setting are reported to have calcium concentrations <2.1 mmol/L (8.5 mg/dL), most do not have a reduction in ionized calcium. Patients with severe sepsis may have a decrease in ionized calcium (true hypocalcemia), but in other severely ill individuals, hypoalbuminemia is the primary cause of the reduced total calcium concentration. Alkalosis increases calcium binding to proteins, and in this setting direct measurements of ionized calcium should be made.

Medications such as protamine, heparin, and glucagon may cause transient hypocalcemia. These forms of hypocalcemia are usually not associated with tetany and resolve with improvement in the overall medical condition. The hypocalcemia after repeated transfusions of citrated blood usually resolves quickly.

Patients with acute pancreatitis have hypocalcemia that persists during the acute inflammation and varies in degree with the severity of the pancreatitis. The cause of hypocalcemia remains unclear. PTH values are reported to be low, normal, or elevated, and both resistance to PTH and impaired PTH secretion have been postulated. Occasionally, a chronic low total calcium and low ionized calcium concentration are detected in an elderly patient without obvious cause and with a paucity of symptoms; the pathogenesis is unclear.

Chronic hypocalcemia, however, is usually symptomatic and requires treatment. Neuromuscular and neurologic manifestations of chronic hypocalcemia include muscle spasms, carpopedal spasm, facial grimacing, and, in extreme cases, laryngeal spasm and convulsions. Respiratory arrest may occur. Increased intracranial pressure occurs in some patients with long-standing hypocalcemia, often in association with papilledema. Mental changes include irritability, depression, and psychosis. The QT interval on the electrocardiogram is prolonged, in contrast to its shortening with hypercalcemia. Arrhythmias occur, and digitalis effectiveness may be reduced. Intestinal cramps and chronic malabsorption may occur. Chvostek's or Trousseau's sign can be used to confirm latent tetany.

The classification of hypocalcemia shown in Table 353-5 is based on an organizationally useful premise that PTH is responsible for minute-to-minute regulation of plasma calcium concentration and, therefore, that the occurrence of hypocalcemia must mean a failure of the homeostatic action of PTH. Failure of the PTH response can occur if there is hereditary or acquired parathyroid gland failure, if PTH is ineffective in target organs, or if the action of the hormone is overwhelmed by the loss of calcium from the ECF at a rate faster than it can be replaced.

PTH Absent

Whether hereditary or acquired, hypoparathyroidism has a number of common components. Symptoms of untreated hypocalcemia are shared by both types of hypoparathyroidism, although the onset of hereditary hypoparathyroidism is more gradual and is often associated with other developmental defects. Basal ganglia calcification and extrapyramidal syndromes are more common and earlier in onset in hereditary hypoparathyroidism. In earlier decades, acquired hypoparathyroidism secondary to surgery in the neck was more common than hereditary hypoparathyroidism, but the frequency of surgically induced parathyroid failure has diminished as a result of improved surgical techniques that spare the parathyroid glands and increased use of nonsurgical therapy for hyperthyroidism. PHP, an example of ineffective PTH action rather than a failure of parathyroid gland production, may share several features with hypoparathyroidism, including extraosseous calcification and extrapyramidal manifestations such as choreoathetotic movements and dystonia.

Papilledema and raised intracranial pressure may occur in both hereditary and acquired hypoparathyroidism, as do chronic changes in fingernails and hair and lenticular cataracts, the latter usually reversible with treatment of hypocalcemia. Certain skin manifestations, including alopecia and candidiasis, are characteristic of hereditary hypoparathyroidism associated with autoimmune polyglandular failure (Chap. 351).

Hypocalcemia associated with hypomagnesemia is associated with both deficient PTH release and impaired responsiveness to the hormone. Patients with hypocalcemia secondary to hypomagnesemia have absent or low levels of circulating PTH, indicative of diminished hormone release despite a maximum physiologic stimulus by hypocalcemia. Plasma PTH levels return to normal with correction of the hypomagnesemia. Thus hypoparathyroidism with low levels of PTH in blood can be due to hereditary gland failure, acquired gland failure, or acute but reversible gland dysfunction (hypomagnesemia).

Genetic Abnormalities and Hereditary Hypoparathyroidism

Hereditary hypoparathyroidism can occur as an isolated entity without other endocrine or dermatologic manifestations. More typically, it occurs in association with other abnormalities such as defective development of the thymus or failure of other endocrine organs such as the adrenal, thyroid, or ovary (Chap. 351). Hereditary hypoparathyroidism is often manifest within the first decade but may appear later.

Genetic defects associated with hypoparathyroidism serve to illuminate the complexity of organ development, hormonal biosynthesis and secretion, and tissue-specific patterns of endocrine effector function (Fig. 353-5). Often, hypoparathyroidism is isolated, signifying a highly specific functional disturbance. When hypoparathyroidism is associated with other developmental or organ defects, treatment of the hypocalcemia can still be effective.

A rare form of hypoparathyroidism associated with defective development of both the thymus and the parathyroid glands is termed the DiGeorge syndrome, or the velocardiofacial syndrome. Congenital cardiovascular, facial, and other developmental defects are present, and patients may die in early childhood with severe infections, hypocalcemia and seizures, or cardiovascular complications. Patients can survive into adulthood, and milder, incomplete forms occur. Most cases are sporadic, but an autosomal dominant form involving microdeletions of chromosome 22q11.2 has been described. Smaller deletions in chromosome 22 are seen in incomplete forms of the DiGeorge syndrome, appearing in childhood or adolescence, that are manifest primarily by parathyroid gland failure. The chromosome 22 defect is now termed DSG1; more recently, a defect in chromosome 10p is also recognized〞now called DSG2. The phenotypes seem similar. Studies on the chromosome 22 defect have pinpointed a transcription factor, TBX1. Deletions of the orthologous mouse gene show a phenotype similar to the human syndrome.

Another autosomal dominant developmental defect, featuring hypoparathyroidism, deafness, and renal dysplasia (HDR) has been studied at a genetic level. Cytogenic abnormalities in some, but not all kindred, point to translocation defects on chromosome 10, as in DiGeorge syndrome. However, the lack of immunodeficiency and heart defects distinguishes the two syndromes. Mouse models, as well as deletional analysis in some HDR patients, has pointed to transcription factor GATA3, which is important in embryonic development and is expressed in developing kidney, ear structures, and the parathyroids.

Another pair of linked developmental disorders involving the parathyroids is recognized. Kenney-Caffey syndrome features hypoparathyroidism, short stature, osteosclerosis, and thick cortical bones. A defect seen in Middle Eastern patients, particularly in Saudi Arabia, termed Sanjad-Sakati syndrome, also exhibits growth failure and other dysmorphic features. This syndrome, which is clearly autosomal recessive, involves a gene on chromosome 1q42-q43. Both syndromes apparently involve a chaperone protein, called TBCE, relevant to tubulin function.

Hypoparathyroidism can occur in association with a complex hereditary autoimmune syndrome involving failure of the adrenals, the ovaries, the immune system, and the parathyroids in association with recurrent mucocutaneous candidiasis, alopecia, vitiligo, and pernicious anemia (Chap. 351). The responsible gene on chromosome 21q22.3 has been identified. The protein product, which resembles a transcription factor, has been termed the autoimmune regulator, or AIRE. A stop codon mutation occurs in many Finnish families with the disorder, commonly referred to as polyglandular autoimmune type 1 deficiency.

Hypoparathyroidism is seen in two disorders associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and myopathy, one termed the Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS), with ophthalmoplegia and pigmentary retinopathy, and the other termed the MELAS syndrome, mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes. Mutations or deletions in mitochondrial genes have been identified.

Several forms of hypoparathyroidism, each rare in frequency, are seen as isolated defects; the genetic mechanisms are varied. The inheritance includes autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked modes. Three separate autosomal defects involving the parathyroid gene have been recognized: one is dominant and the other two are recessive. The dominant form has a point mutation in the signal sequence, a critical region involved in intracellular transport of the hormone precursor. An Arg for Cys mutation interferes with processing of the precursor and is believed to trigger an apoptotic cellular response, hence acting as a dominant negative. The other two forms are recessive. One point mutation also blocks cleavage of the PTH precursor but requires both alleles to cause hypoparathyroidism. The third involves a single-nucleotide base change that results in an exon splicing defect; the lost exon contains the promoter〞hence, the gene is silenced. An X-linked recessive form of hypoparathyroidism has been described in males and the defect has been localized to chromosome Xq26-q27, perhaps involving the SOX3 gene.

Abnormalities in the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) are detected in three distinctive hypocalcemic disorders. All are rare but more than 10 different gain-of-function mutations have been found in one form of hypocalcemia termed autosomal dominant hypocalcemic hypercalciuria (ADHH). The receptor senses the ambient calcium level as excessive and suppresses PTH secretion, leading to hypocalcemia. The hypocalcemia is aggravated by constitutive receptor activity in the renal tubule causing excretion of inappropriate amounts of calcium. Recognition of the syndrome is important because efforts to treat the hypocalcemia with vitamin D analogues and increased oral calcium exacerbate the already excessive urinary calcium excretion (several grams or more per 24 hours), leading to irreversible renal damage from stones and ectopic calcification.

Other causes of isolated hypoparathyroidism include homozygous, inactivating mutations in the parathyroid-specific transcription factor GCMB, which lead to an autosomal recessive form of the disease, or heterozygous point mutations in GCMB, which have a dominant negative effect on the wild-type protein and thus lead to an autosomal dominant form of hypoparathyroidism.

The Bartter syndrome is a group of disorders associated with disturbances in electrolyte and acid/base balance, sometimes with nephrocalcinosis and other features. Several types of ion channels or transporters are involved. Curiously, Bartter syndrome type V has the electrolyte and pH disturbances seen in the other syndromes but appears to be due to a gain of function in the CaSR. The defect may be more severe than in ADHH and explains the additional features seen beyond hypocalcemia and hypercalciuria.

As with autoimmune disorders that block the CaSR (discussed above under hypercalcemic conditions), there are autoantibodies that at least transiently activate the CaSR, leading to suppressed PTH secretion and hypocalcemia. This disorder, which may wax and wane, could be classified as an acquired form of hypoparathyroidism but is listed here with other disorders involving the CaSR.

Acquired Hypoparathyroidism

Acquired chronic hypoparathyroidism is usually the result of inadvertent surgical removal of all the parathyroid glands; in some instances, not all the tissue is removed, but the remainder undergoes vascular supply compromise secondary to fibrotic changes in the neck after surgery. In the past, the most frequent cause of acquired hypoparathyroidism was surgery for hyperthyroidism. Hypoparathyroidism now usually occurs after surgery for hyperparathyroidism when the surgeon, facing the dilemma of removing too little tissue and thus not curing the hyperparathyroidism, removes too much. Parathyroid function may not be totally absent in all patients with postoperative hypoparathyroidism.

Even rarer causes of acquired chronic hypoparathyroidism include radiation-induced damage subsequent to radioiodine therapy of hyperthyroidism and glandular damage in patients with hemochromatosis or hemosiderosis after repeated blood transfusions. Infection may involve one or more of the parathyroids but usually does not cause hypoparathyroidism because all four glands are rarely involved.

Transient hypoparathyroidism is frequent following surgery for hyperparathyroidism. After a variable period of hypoparathyroidism, normal parathyroid function may return due to hyperplasia or recovery of remaining tissue. Occasionally, recovery occurs months after surgery.

Treatment: Acquired and Hereditary Hypoparathyroidism

Treatment involves replacement with vitamin D or 1,25(OH)2D3 (calcitriol) combined with a high oral calcium intake. In most patients, blood calcium and phosphate levels are satisfactorily regulated, but some patients show resistance and a brittleness, with a tendency to alternate between hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia. For many patients, vitamin D in doses of 40,000每120,000 U/d (1每3 mg/d) combined with ≡1 g elemental calcium is satisfactory. The wide dosage range reflects the variation encountered from patient to patient; precise regulation of each patient is required. Compared to typical daily requirements in euparathyroid patients of 200 U/d (or in older patients as high as 800 U/d), the high dose of vitamin D (as much as 100-fold higher) reflects the reduced conversion of vitamin D to 1,25(OH)2D. Many physicians now use 0.5每1 米g of calcitriol in management of such patients, especially if they are difficult to control. Because of its storage in fat, when vitamin D is withdrawn, weeks are required for the disappearance of the biologic effects, compared with a few days for calcitriol, which has a rapid turnover.

Oral calcium and vitamin D restore the overall calcium-phosphate balance but do not reverse the lowered urinary calcium reabsorption typical of hypoparathyroidism. Therefore, care must be taken to avoid excessive urinary calcium excretion after vitamin D and calcium replacement therapy; otherwise, kidney stones can develop. Thiazide diuretics lower urine calcium by as much as 100 mg/d in hypoparathyroid patients on vitamin D, provided they are maintained on a low-sodium diet. Use of thiazides seems to be of benefit in mitigating hypercalciuria and easing the daily management of these patients.

There are now trials of parenterally administered PTH [either PTH(1每34) or PTH(1每84)] in patients with hypoparathyroidism providing greater ease of maintaining serum calcium and reducing urinary calcium excretion (desirable to protect any renal damage). However, PTH therapy is not approved as of yet.

Hypomagnesemia

Severe hypomagnesemia (<0.4 mmol/L; <0.8 meq/L) is associated with hypocalcemia (Chap. 352). Restoration of the total-body magnesium deficit leads to rapid reversal of hypocalcemia. There are at least two causes of the hypocalcemia〞impaired PTH secretion and reduced responsiveness to PTH. For further discussion of causes and treatment of hypomagnesemia, seeChap. 352.

The effects of magnesium on PTH secretion are similar to those of calcium; hypermagnesemia suppresses and hypomagnesemia stimulates PTH secretion. The effects of magnesium on PTH secretion are normally of little significance, however, because the calcium effects dominate. Greater change in magnesium than in calcium is needed to influence hormone secretion. Nonetheless, hypomagnesemia might be expected to increase hormone secretion. It is therefore surprising to find that severe hypomagnesemia is associated with blunted secretion of PTH. The explanation for the paradox is that severe, chronic hypomagnesemia leads to intracellular magnesium deficiency, which interferes with secretion and peripheral responses to PTH. The mechanism of the cellular abnormalities caused by hypomagnesemia is unknown, although effects on adenylate cyclase (for which magnesium is a cofactor) have been proposed.

PTH levels are undetectable or inappropriately low in severe hypomagnesemia despite the stimulus of severe hypocalcemia, and acute repletion of magnesium leads to a rapid increase in PTH level. Serum phosphate levels are often not elevated, in contrast to the situation with acquired or idiopathic hypoparathyroidism, probably because phosphate deficiency is often seen in hypomagnesmia (see Chap. 331).

Diminished peripheral responsiveness to PTH also occurs in some patients, as documented by subnormal response in urinary phosphorus and urinary cyclic AMP excretion after administration of exogenous PTH to patients who are hypocalcemic and hypomagnesemic. Both blunted PTH secretion and lack of renal response to administered PTH can occur in the same patient. When acute magnesium repletion is undertaken, the restoration of PTH levels to normal or supranormal may precede restoration of normal serum calcium by several days.

Treatment: Hypomagnesemia

Repletion of magnesium cures the condition. Repletion should be parenteral. Attention must be given to restoring the intracellular deficit, which may be considerable. After IV magnesium administration, serum magnesium may return transiently to the normal range, but unless replacement therapy is adequate, serum magnesium will again fall. If the cause of the hypomagnesemia is renal magnesium wasting, magnesium may have to be given long-term to prevent recurrence (Chap. 352).

PTH Ineffective

PTH is ineffective when the PTH/PTHrP receptor每guanyl nucleotide每binding protein complex is defective (PHP, discussed below), when PTH action to promote calcium absorption from the diet is impaired because of vitamin D deficiency or because vitamin D is ineffective (defects in vitamin D receptor or vitamin D synthesis), or in chronic renal failure in which the calcium-elevating action of PTH is impaired.

Typically, hypophosphatemia is more severe than hypocalcemia in vitamin D deficiency states because of the increased secretion of PTH, which, although only partly effective in elevating blood calcium, is capable of promoting phosphaturia.

PHP, on the other hand, has a pathophysiology different from the other disorders of ineffective PTH action. PHP resembles hypoparathyroidism (in which PTH synthesis is deficient) and is manifested by hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, yet elevated PTH levels. The cause of the disorder is defective PTH-dependent activation of guanyl nucleotide每binding proteins, resulting in failure of PTH to increase intracellular cyclic AMP (see below).

Chronic Renal Failure

Improved medical management of chronic kidney disease now allows many patients to survive for decades and hence time enough to develop features of renal osteodystrophy, which must be controlled to avoid additional morbidity. Impaired production of 1,25(OH)2D is now thought to be the principal factor that causes calcium deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone disease; hyperphosphatemia typically occurs only in the later stages of CKD. Low levels of 1,25(OH)2D due to increased FGF23 production in bone are critical in the development of hypocalcemia. The uremic state also causes impairment of intestinal absorption by mechanisms other than defects in vitamin D metabolism. Nonetheless, treatment with supraphysiologic amounts of vitamin D or calcitriol corrects the impaired calcium absorption. Since increased FGF23 levels are seen even in early stages of renal failure in some patients, and have been reported to correlate with increased mortality, there is current interest in methods (lowering phosphate absorption) to lower FGF23 levels and concern as to whether vitamin D supplementation (known physiologically to increase FGF23) increases FGF23 in CKD.

Hyperphosphatemia in renal failure lowers blood calcium levels by several mechanisms, including extraosseous deposition of calcium and phosphate, impairment of the bone-resorbing action of PTH, and reduction in 1,25(OH)2D production by remaining renal tissue.

Treatment: Chronic Renal Failure

Therapy of chronic renal failure (Chap. 280) involves appropriate management of patients prior to dialysis and adjustment of regimens once dialysis is initiated. Attention should be paid to restriction of phosphate in the diet; avoidance of aluminum-containing phosphate-binding antacids to prevent the problem of aluminum intoxication; provision of an adequate calcium intake by mouth, usually 1每2 g/d; and supplementation with 0.25每1 米g/d calcitriol. Each patient must be monitored closely. The aim of therapy is to restore normal calcium balance to prevent osteomalacia and severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (it is usually recommended to maintain PTH levels between 100 and 300 pg/mL) and, in light of evidence of genetic changes and monoclonal outgrowths of parathyroid glands in CKD patients, to prevent secondary from becoming autonomous hyperparathyroidism. Reduction of hyperphosphatemia and restoration of normal intestinal calcium absorption by calcitriol can improve blood calcium levels and reduce the manifestations of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Since adynamic bone disease can occur in association with low PTH levels, it is important to avoid excessive suppression of the parathyroid glands while recognizing the beneficial effects of controlling the secondary hyperparathyroidism. These patients should probably be closely monitored with PTH assays that detect only the full-length PTH(1每84) to ensure that biologically active PTH and not inactive, inhibitory PTH fragments are measured. Use of phosphate-binding agents such as sevelamer are approved for payment only in end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Vitamin D Deficiency Due to Inadequate Diet and/or Sunlight

Vitamin D deficiency due to inadequate intake of dairy products enriched with vitamin D, lack of vitamin supplementation, and reduced sunlight exposure in the elderly, particularly during winter in northern latitudes, is more common in the United States than previously recognized. Biopsies of bone in elderly patients with hip fracture (documenting osteomalacia) and abnormal levels of vitamin D metabolites, PTH, calcium, and phosphate indicate that vitamin D deficiency may occur in as many as 25% of elderly patients, particularly in northern latitudes in the United States. Concentrations of 25(OH)D are low or low-normal in these patients. Quantitative histomorphometry of bone biopsy specimens reveals widened osteoid seams consistent with osteomalacia (Chap. 352). PTH hypersecretion compensates for the tendency for the blood calcium to fall but also induces renal phosphate wasting and results in osteomalacia.

Treatment involves adequate replacement with vitamin D and calcium until the deficiencies are corrected. Severe hypocalcemia rarely occurs in moderately severe vitamin D deficiency of the elderly, but vitamin D deficiency must be considered in the differential diagnosis of mild hypocalcemia.

Mild hypocalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, severe hypophosphatemia, and a variety of nutritional deficiencies occur with gastrointestinal diseases. Hepatocellular dysfunction can lead to reduction in 25(OH)D levels, as in portal or biliary cirrhosis of the liver, and malabsorption of vitamin D and its metabolites, including 1,25(OH)2D, may occur in a variety of bowel diseases, hereditary or acquired. Hypocalcemia itself can lead to steatorrhea, due to deficient production of pancreatic enzymes and bile salts. Depending on the disorder, vitamin D or its metabolites can be given parenterally, guaranteeing adequate blood levels of active metabolites.

Defective Vitamin D Metabolism

Anticonvulsant Therapy

Anticonvulsant therapy with any of several agents induces acquired vitamin D deficiency by increasing the conversion of vitamin D to inactive compounds and/or causing resistance to its action. The more marginal the vitamin D intake in the diet, the more likely that anticonvulsant therapy will lead to abnormal mineral and bone metabolism.

Vitamin D每Dependent Rickets Type I

Rickets can be due to resistance to the action of vitamin D as well as to vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D每dependent rickets type I, previously termed pseudo-vitamin D每resistant rickets, differs from true vitamin D每resistant rickets (vitamin D每dependent rickets type II, see below) in that it is less severe and the biochemical and radiographic abnormalities can be reversed with appropriate doses of the vitamin's active metabolite, 1,25(OH)2D3. Physiologic amounts of calcitriol cure the disease (Chap. 352). This finding fits with the pathophysiology of the disorder, which is autosomal recessive, and is now known to be caused by mutations in the gene encoding 25(OH)D-1汐-hydroxylase. Both alleles are inactivated in all patients, and compound heterozygotes, harboring distinct mutations, are common.

Clinical features include hypocalcemia, often with tetany or convulsions, hypophosphatemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and osteomalacia, often associated with skeletal deformities and increased alkaline phosphatase. Treatment involves physiologic replacement doses of 1,25(OH)2D3 (Chap. 352).

Vitamin D每Dependent Rickets Type II

Vitamin D每dependent rickets type II results from end-organ resistance to the active metabolite 1,25(OH)2D3. The clinical features resemble those of the type I disorder and include hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and rickets but also partial or total alopecia. Plasma levels of 1,25(OH)2D are elevated, in keeping with the refractoriness of the end organs. This disorder is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the vitamin D receptor; treatment is difficult and requires regular, usually nocturnal calcium infusions (Chap. 352).

Pseudohypoparathyroidism

PHP refers to a group of distinct inherited disorders. Patients are characterized by symptoms and signs of hypocalcemia in association with distinctive skeletal and developmental defects. The hypocalcemia is due to a deficient response to PTH, which is probably restricted to the proximal renal tubules. Hyperplasia of the parathyroids, a response to hormone-resistant hypocalcemia, causes elevation of PTH levels. Studies, both clinical and basic, have clarified some aspects of these disorders, including the variable clinical spectrum, the pathophysiology, the genetic defects, and their mode of inheritance.

A working classification of the various forms of PHP is given in Table 353-6. The classification scheme is based on the signs of ineffective PTH action (low calcium and high phosphate), urinary cyclic AMP response to exogenous PTH, the presence or absence of Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO), and assays to measure the concentration of the Gs汐 subunit of the adenylate cyclase enzyme. Using these criteria, there are four types: PHP types Ia and Ib; pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP), and the related disorder POH, and PHP-II.

PPHP No Normal Normal Yes Yes No 
 


Abbreviations: , decreased; , increased; AHO, Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy; PTH, parathyroid hormone.
 

Php-Ia and Php-Ib

Individuals with PHP-I, the most common of the disorders, show a deficient urinary cyclic AMP response to administration of exogenous PTH. Patients with PHP-I are divided into type Ia and type Ib. Patients with PHP-Ia show evidence for AHO and reduced amounts of Gs汐 protein/activity in readily accessible tissues, such as erythrocytes, lymphocytes, and fibroblasts. Patients with PHP-Ib typically lack evidence for AHO and they have normal Gs汐 activity. PHP-Ic, sometimes listed as a third form of PHP, is really a variant of PHP-Ia, since the mutant Gs汐 shows normal activity in certain in vitro assays.

Most patients who have PHP-Ia reveal characteristic features of AHO, consisting of short stature, round face, skeletal anomalies (brachydactyly), and/or heterotopic calcification. Patients have low calcium and high phosphate levels, as with true hypoparathyroidism. PTH levels, however, are elevated, reflecting resistance to hormone action.

Amorphous deposits of calcium and phosphate are found in the basal ganglia in about one-half of patients. The defects in metacarpal and metatarsal bones are sometimes accompanied by short phalanges as well, possibly reflecting premature closing of the epiphyses. The typical findings are short fourth and fifth metacarpals and metatarsals. The defects are usually bilateral. Exostoses and radius curvus are frequent. Impairments in olfaction and taste and unusual dermatoglyphic abnormalities have been reported.

Inheritance and Genetic Patterns

Multiple defects at the GNAS locus have now been identified in PHP-Ia, PHP-Ib, and PPHP patients. This gene, which is located on chromosome 20q13.3, encodes the 汐-subunit of the stimulatory G-protein (Gs汐), among other products (see below). Mutations include abnormalities in splice junctions associated with deficient mRNA production, point mutations, insertions, and/or deletion that all result in a protein with defective function, i.e. a 50% reduction in Gs汐 activity in erythrocytes or other cells.

Detailed analyses of disease transmission in affected kindreds have clarified many features of PHP-Ia, PPHP, and PHP-Ib (Fig. 353-7). The former two entities, traced through multiple kindreds, have an inheritance pattern consistent with gene imprinting〞only females, not males, can transmit the full disease with hypocalcemia〞and PHP-Ia and PPHP do not coexist in the same generation. The phenomenon of gene imprinting, involving methylation of gene loci, independent of any mutation, involves selective inactivation of either the maternal or the paternal allele (Chap. 61). In the case of the Gs汐 transcript, it is paternally imprinted (silenced) in the renal cortex (where the disease manifestation is expressed), so that the disease PHP-Ia can never be inherited from the father carrying the defective allele but only from a mother whose allelic product is critical for the PTH-dependent function in the proximal tubules of the kidney. In the renal cortex, it is postulated that only the maternal allele is normally active (independent of any mutation), such that lack of activity from a defective paternal allele is not of consequence. This explains the occurrence in PHP-Ia of hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and resistance to PTH and often to other hormones that mediate their actions through a G protein每coupled receptor in tissues where imprinting also occurs. Strong additional evidence favoring this overall hypothesis comes from gene knockout studies in the mouse (ablating exon 2 of the gene responsible for Gs汐 synthesis). Mice inheriting the mutant allele from the female had undetectable Gs汐 protein in renal cortex and were hypocalcemic and resistant to renal actions of PTH. Offspring inheriting the mutant allele from the male showed no evidence of PTH resistance or hypocalcemia.

Figure 353-7

 
 
 
Paternal imprinting of renal parathyroid hormone (PTH) resistance (GNAS-1 gene for Gs汐 subunit) in pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHPIa). An impaired excretion of urinary cyclic AMP and phosphate is observed in patients with PHP. In the renal cortex, there is selective silencing of the paternal Gs汐 gene mRNA. The disease becomes manifest only in patients who inherit the defective gene from an obligate female carrier (left). If the genetic defect is inherited from an obligate male gene carrier, there is no biochemical abnormality; administration of PTH causes an appropriate increase in the urinary cyclic AMP and phosphate concentration [pseudo-PHP (PPHP); right]. Both patterns of inheritance lead to Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO), perhaps because of haplotype insufficiency〞i.e., both copies of Gs汐 must be active in the fetus for normal bone development.
 
 

Imprinting is tissue selective. Paternal Gs汐 expression is not silenced in most tissues. It seems likely, therefore, that the AHO phenotype recognized in PPHP as well as PHP-Ia reflects Gs汐 haploinsufficiency during embryonic or postnatal development.

The complex mechanisms that control the GNAS gene contribute to challenges involved in unraveling the pathogenesis of these disorders, especially that of PHP-Ib. Much intensive work with families in which multiple members are affected by PHP-Ib, as well as studies of the complex regulation of the GNAS gene locus, have now shown that PHP-Ib is caused by microdeletions within or up-stream of the GNAS locus, which are associated with a loss of DNA methylation at one or several loci of the maternal allele (Table 353-6). These abnormalities in methylation silence the expression of the gene. This leads in the renal cortex〞where Gs汐 appears to be expressed exclusively from the maternal allele〞to PTH resistance. In other tissues, Gs汐 expression is not imprinted; hence erythrocytes show normal levels of Gs汐.

PHP-Ib, lacking the AHO phenotype in most instances, shares with PHP-Ia the hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia caused by PTH resistance, and thus the blunted urinary cyclic AMP response to administered PTH, a standard test to assess the presence or absence of hormone resistance (Table 353-6). Furthermore, these endocrine abnormalities become apparent only if the disease-causing mutation is inherited maternally. Bone responsiveness may be excessive rather than blunted in PHP-Ib (and in PHP-Ia) patients, based on case reports that have emphasized an osteitis fibrosa每like pattern in several PHP-Ib patients.

PHP-II refers to patients with hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia who have a normal urinary cyclic AMP, but an impaired urinary phosphaturic response to PTH. These patients are assumed to have a defect in the response to PTH at a locus distal to cyclic AMP production. It remains unclear why the PTH resistance in some patients, labeled as PHP-II, can be treated with vitamin D supplements.

The diagnosis of these hormone-resistant states can usually be made without difficulty when there is a positive family history for features of AHO, in association with the signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia. In both categories〞PHP-Ia and PHP-Ib〞serum PTH levels are elevated, particularly when patients are hypocalcemic. However, patients with PHP-Ib or PHP-II usually do not have phenotypic abnormalities, only hypocalcemia with high PTH levels, as evidence for hormone resistance. In PHP-Ib, the response of urinary cyclic AMP to the administration of exogenous PTH is blunted. The diagnosis of PHP-II is more complex, in that cyclic AMP responses in urine are, by definition, normal. Vitamin D deficiency must be excluded before the diagnosis of PHP-II can be entertained.

Treatment: Pseudohypoparathyroidism

Treatment of PHP is similar to that of hypoparathyroidism, except that calcium and vitamin D doses are usually lower. Patients with PHP show no PTH resistance in the distal tubules〞hence, urinary calcium clearance is not affected and they are at less risk of developing nephrocalcinosis than in patients with true hypoparathyroidism. Variability in response makes it necessary to establish the optimal regimen for each patient, based on maintaining the appropriate blood calcium level and urinary calcium excretion.

PTH Overwhelmed

Occasionally, loss of calcium from the ECF is so severe that PTH cannot compensate. Such situations include acute pancreatitis and severe, acute hyperphosphatemia, often in association with renal failure, conditions in which there is rapid efflux of calcium from the ECF. Severe hypocalcemia can occur quickly; PTH rises in response to hypocalcemia but does not return blood calcium to normal.

Severe, Acute Hyperphosphatemia

Severe hyperphosphatemia is associated with extensive tissue damage or cell destruction (Chap. 352). The combination of increased release of phosphate from muscle and impaired ability to excrete phosphorus because of renal failure causes moderate to severe hyperphosphatemia, the latter causing calcium loss from the blood and mild to moderate hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia is usually reversed with tissue repair and restoration of renal function as phosphorus and creatinine values return to normal. There may even be a mild hypercalcemic period in the oliguric phase of renal function recovery. This sequence, severe hypocalcemia followed by mild hypercalcemia, reflects widespread deposition of calcium in muscle and subsequent redistribution of some of the calcium to the ECF after phosphate levels return to normal.

Other causes of hyperphosphatemia include hypothermia, massive hepatic failure, and hematologicmalignancies, either because of high cell turnover of malignancy or because of cell destruction by chemotherapy.

Treatment: Severe, Acute Hyperphosphatemia

Treatment is directed toward lowering of blood phosphate by the administration of phosphate-binding antacids or dialysis, often needed for the management of renal failure. Although calcium replacement may be necessary if hypocalcemia is severe and symptomatic, calcium administration during the hyperphosphatemic period tends to increase extraosseous calcium deposition and aggravate tissue damage. The levels of 1,25(OH)2D may be low during the hyperphosphatemic phase and return to normal during the oliguric phase of recovery.

Osteitis Fibrosa after Parathyroidectomy

Severe hypocalcemia after parathyroid surgery is rare now that osteitis fibrosa cystica is an infrequent manifestation of hyperparathyroidism. When osteitis fibrosa cystica is severe, however, bone mineral deficits can be large. After parathyroidectomy, hypocalcemia can persist for days if calcium replacement is inadequate. Treatment may require parenteral administration of calcium; addition of calcitriol and oral calcium supplementation is sometimes needed for weeks to a month or two until bone defects are filled (which, of course, is of therapeutic benefit in the skeleton), making it possible to discontinue parenteral calcium and/or reduce the amount.

Differential Diagnosis of Hypocalcemia

Care must be taken to ensure that true hypocalcemia is present; in addition, acute transient hypocalcemia can be a manifestation of a variety of severe, acute illnesses, as discussed above. Chronic hypocalcemia, however, can usually be ascribed to a few disorders associated with absent or ineffective PTH. Important clinical criteria include the duration of the illness, signs or symptoms of associated disorders, and the presence of features that suggest a hereditary abnormality. A nutritional history can be helpful in recognizing a low intake of vitamin D and calcium in the elderly, and a history of excessive alcohol intake may suggest magnesium deficiency.

Hypoparathyroidism and PHP are typically lifelong illnesses, usually (but not always) appearing by adolescence; hence, a recent onset of hypocalcemia in an adult is more likely due to nutritional deficiencies, renal failure, or intestinal disorders that result in deficient or ineffective vitamin D. Neck surgery, even long past, however, can be associated with a delayed onset of postoperative hypoparathyroidism. A history of seizure disorder raises the issue of anticonvulsive medication. Developmental defects may point to the diagnosis of PHP. Rickets and a variety of neuromuscular syndromes and deformities may indicate ineffective vitamin D action, either due to defects in vitamin D metabolism or to vitamin D deficiency.

A pattern of low calcium with high phosphorus in the absence of renal failure or massive tissue destruction almost invariably means hypoparathyroidism or PHP. A low calcium and low phosphorus pattern points to absent or ineffective vitamin D, thereby impairing the action of PTH on calcium metabolism (but not phosphate clearance). The relative ineffectiveness of PTH in calcium homeostasis in vitamin D deficiency, anticonvulsant therapy, gastrointestinal disorders, and hereditary defects in vitamin D metabolism leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism as a compensation. The excess PTH on renal tubule phosphate transport accounts for renal phosphate wasting and hypophosphatemia.

Exceptions to these patterns may occur. Most forms of hypomagnesemia are due to long-standing nutritional deficiency as seen in chronic alcoholics. Despite the fact that the hypocalcemia is principally due to an acute absence of PTH, phosphate levels are usually low, rather than elevated, as in hypoparathyroidism. Chronic renal failure is often associated with hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, despite secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Diagnosis is usually established by application of the PTH immunoassay, tests for vitamin D metabolites, and measurements of the urinary cyclic AMP response to exogenous PTH. In hereditary and acquired hypoparathyroidism and in severe hypomagnesemia, PTH is either undetectable or in the normal range (Fig. 353-4). This finding in a hypocalcemic patient is supportive of hypoparathyroidism, as distinct from ineffective PTH action, in which even mild hypocalcemia is associated with elevated PTH levels. Hence a failure to detect elevated PTH levels establishes the diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism; elevated levels suggest the presence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, as found in many of the situations in which the hormone is ineffective due to associated abnormalities in vitamin D action. Assays for 25(OH)D can be helpful. Low or low-normal 25(OH)D indicates vitamin D deficiency due to lack of sunlight, inadequate vitamin D intake, or intestinal malabsorption. Recognition that mild hypocalcemia, rickets, and hypophosphatemia are due to anticonvulsant therapy is made by history.

Treatment: Hypocalcemic States

The management of hypoparathyroidism, PHP, chronic renal failure, and hereditary defects in vitamin D metabolism involves the use of vitamin D or vitamin D metabolites and calcium supplementation. Vitamin D itself is the least expensive form of vitamin D replacement and is frequently used in the management of uncomplicated hypoparathyroidism and some disorders associated with ineffective vitamin D action. When vitamin D is used prophylactically, as in the elderly or in those with chronic anticonvulsant therapy, there is a wider margin of safety than with the more potent metabolites. However, most of the conditions in which vitamin D is administered chronically for hypocalcemia require amounts 50每100 times the daily replacement dose because the formation of 1,25(OH)2D is deficient. In such situations, vitamin D is no safer than the active metabolite because intoxication can occur with high-dose therapy (because of storage in fat). Calcitriol is more rapid in onset of action and also has a short biologic half-life.

Vitamin D [at least 1000 U/d (2每3 米g/d) (higher levels required in older persons)] or calcitriol (0.25每1 米g/d) is required to prevent rickets in normal individuals. In contrast, 40,000每120,000 U (1每3 mg) of vitamin D2 or D3 is typically required in hypoparathyroidism. The dose of calcitriol is unchanged in hypoparathyroidism, since the defect is in hydroxylation by the 25(OH)D-1汐-hydroxylase. Calcitriol is also used in disorders of 25(OH)D-1汐-hydroxylase; vitamin D receptor defects are much more difficult to treat.

Patients with hypoparathyroidism should be given 2每3 g elemental calcium PO each day. The two agents, vitamin D or calcitriol and oral calcium, can be varied independently. Urinary calcium excretion needs to be monitored carefully. If hypocalcemia alternates with episodes of hypercalcemia in high-brittleness patients with hypoparathyroidism, administration of calcitriol and use of thiazides, as discussed above, may make management easier.

 Chapter 354. Osteoporosis >
 

Osteoporosis: Introduction

Osteoporosis, a condition characterized by decreased bone strength, is prevalent among postmenopausal women but also occurs in men and women with underlying conditions or major risk factors associated with bone demineralization. Its chief clinical manifestations are vertebral and hip fractures, although fractures can occur at any skeletal site. Osteoporosis affects >10 million individuals in the United States, but only a small proportion are diagnosed and treated.
 
Definition

Osteoporosis is defined as a reduction in the strength of bone that leads to an increased risk of fractures. Loss of bone tissue is associated with deterioration in skeletal microarchitecture. The World Health Organization (WHO) operationally defines osteoporosis as a bone density that falls 2.5 standard deviations (SD) below the mean for young healthy adults of the same sex〞also referred to as a T-score of 每2.5. Postmenopausal women who fall at the lower end of the young normal range (a T-score <每1.0) are defined as having low bone density and are also at increased risk of osteoporosis. More than 50% of fractures among postmenopausal women, including hip fractures, occur in this group with low bone density.
 
Epidemiology

In the United States, as many as 8 million women and 2 million men have osteoporosis (T-score <每2.5), and an additional 18 million individuals have bone mass levels that put them at increased risk of developing osteoporosis (e.g., bone mass T-score <每1.0). Osteoporosis occurs more frequently with increasing age as bone tissue is lost progressively. In women, the loss of ovarian function at menopause (typically about age 50) precipitates rapid bone loss so that most women meet the diagnostic criterion for osteoporosis by age 70每80.

The epidemiology of fractures follows the trend for loss of bone density. Fractures of the distal radius increase in frequency before age 50 and plateau by age 60, with only a modest age-related increase thereafter. In contrast, incidence rates for hip fractures double every 5 years after age 70 (Fig. 354-1). This distinct epidemiology may be related to the way people fall as they age, with fewer falls on an outstretched hand and more falls directly on the hip. At least 1.5 million fractures occur each year in the United States as a consequence of osteoporosis. As the population continues to age, the total number of fractures will continue to escalate.

Epidemiology of vertebral, hip, and Colles' fractures with age.(Adapted from C Cooper, LJ Melton III: Trends Endocrinol Metab 3:224, 1992; with permission.)
 
 


About 300,000 hip fractures occur each year in the United States, most of which require hospital admission and surgical intervention. The probability that a 50-year-old white individual will have a hip fracture during his or her lifetime is 14% for women and 5% for men; the risk for blacks is lower (about one-half those rates). Hip fractures are associated with a high incidence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (20每50%) and a mortality rate between 5 and 20% during the year after surgery.

There are about 700,000 vertebral crush fractures per year in the United States. Only a fraction of them are recognized clinically, since many are relatively asymptomatic and are identified incidentally during radiography for other purposes (Fig. 354-2). Vertebral fractures rarely require hospitalization but are associated with long-term morbidity and a slight increase in mortality rates, primarily related to pulmonary disease. Multiple vertebral fractures lead to height loss (often of several inches), kyphosis, and secondary pain and discomfort related to altered biomechanics of the back. Thoracic fractures can be associated with restrictive lung disease, whereas lumbar fractures are associated with abdominal symptoms that include distention, early satiety, and constipation.

Approximately 250,000 wrist fractures occur in the United States each year. Fractures of other bones (estimated to be 300,000 per year) also occur with osteoporosis; this is not surprising in light of the fact that bone loss is a systemic phenomenon. Fractures of the pelvis and proximal humerus clearly are associated with osteoporosis. Although some fractures result from major trauma, the threshold for fracture is reduced for an osteoporotic bone (Fig. 354-3). In addition to bone density, there are a number of risk factors for fracture; the common ones are summarized in Table 354-1. Age, prior fractures, a family history of osteoporosis-related fractures, low body weight, cigarette consumption, and excessive alcohol use are all independent predictors of fracture. Chronic diseases with inflammatory components that increase skeletal remodeling such as rheumatoid arthritis, increase the risk of osteoporosis, as do diseases associated with malabsorption. Chronic diseases that increase the risk of falling or frailty, including dementia, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, also increase fracture risk.

In the United States and Europe, osteoporosis-related fractures are more common among women than men, presumably due to a lower peak bone mass as well as postmenopausal bone loss in women. However, this sex difference in bone density and age-related increase in hip fractures is not as apparent in some other cultures, possibly due to genetics, physical activity level, or diet.

Fractures are themselves risk factors for future fractures (Table 354-1). Vertebral fractures increase the risk of other vertebral fractures as well as fractures of the peripheral skeleton such as the hip and wrist. Wrist fractures also increase the risk of vertebral and hip fractures. Consequently, among individuals over age 50, any fracture should be considered as potentially related to osteoporosis regardless of the circumstances of the fracture. Osteoporotic bone is more likely to fracture than is normal bone at any level of trauma, and a fracture in a person over 50 should trigger evaluation for osteoporosis.
 
Pathophysiology

Bone Remodeling

Osteoporosis results from bone loss due to age-related changes in bone remodeling as well as extrinsic and intrinsic factors that exaggerate this process. These changes may be superimposed on a low peak bone mass. Consequently, understanding the bone remodeling process is fundamental to understanding the pathophysiology of osteoporosis (Chap. 352). During growth, the skeleton increases in size by linear growth and by apposition of new bone tissue on the outer surfaces of the cortex (Fig. 354-4). The latter process is called modeling, a process that also allows the long bones to adapt in shape to the stresses placed on them. Increased sex hormone production at puberty is required for skeletal maturation, which reaches maximum mass and density in early adulthood. It is around puberty that the sexual dimorphism in skeletal size becomes obvious, although true bone density remains similar between the sexes. Nutrition and lifestyle also play an important role in growth, though genetic factors primarily determine peak skeletal mass and density. Numerous genes control skeletal growth, peak bone mass, and body size, as well as skeletal structure and density. Heritability estimates of 50每80% for bone density and size have been derived on the basis of twin studies. Though peak bone mass is often lower among individuals with a family history of osteoporosis, association studies of candidate genes [vitamin D receptor; type I collagen, the estrogen receptor (ER), and interleukin 6 (IL-6); and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)] and bone mass, bone turnover, and fracture prevalence have been inconsistent. Linkage studies suggest that a genetic locus on chromosome 11 is associated with high bone mass. Families with high bone mass and without much apparent age-related bone loss have been shown to have a point mutation in LRP5, a low-density lipoprotein receptor每related protein. The role of this gene in the general population is not clear, although a nonfunctional mutation results in osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome, and LRP5 signaling appears to be important in controlling bone formation.

In adults, bone remodeling, not modeling, is the principal metabolic skeletal process. Bone remodeling has two primary functions: (1) to repair microdamage within the skeleton to maintain skeletal strength and (2) to supply calcium from the skeleton to maintain serum calcium. Remodeling may be activated by microdamage to bone as a result of excessive or accumulated stress. Acute demands for calcium involve osteoclast-mediated resorption as well as calcium transport by osteocytes. Chronic demands for calcium result in secondary hyperparathyroidism, increased bone remodeling, and overall loss of bone tissue.

Bone remodeling also is regulated by several circulating hormones, including estrogens, androgens, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone (PTH), as well as locally produced growth factors such as IGF-I and immunoreactive growth hormone II (IGH-II), transforming growth factor 汕 (TGF-汕), parathyroid hormone每related peptide (PTHrP), interleukins (ILs), prostaglandins, and members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. These factors primarily modulate the rate at which new remodeling sites are activated, a process that results initially in bone resorption by osteoclasts, followed by a period of repair during which new bone tissue is synthesized by osteoblasts. The cytokine responsible for communication between the osteoblasts, other marrow cells, and osteoclasts has been identified as RANK ligand (RANKL) [receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF百B); RANKL]. RANKL, a member of the TNF family, is secreted by osteoblasts and certain cells of the immune system (Chap. 352). The osteoclast receptor for this protein is referred to as RANK. Activation of RANK by RANKL is a final common path in osteoclast development and activation. A humoral decoy for RANKL, also secreted by osteoblasts, is referred to as osteoprotegerin(Fig. 354-5). Modulation of osteoclast recruitment and activity appears to be related to the interplay among these three factors. Additional influences include nutrition (particularly calcium intake) and physical activity level.

Conversely, osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression is induced by factors that block bone catabolism and promote anabolic effects. OPG binds and neutralizes RANKL, leading to a block in osteoclastogenesis and decreased survival of preexisting osteoclasts.

In young adults resorbed bone is replaced by an equal amount of new bone tissue. Thus, the mass of the skeleton remains constant after peak bone mass is achieved in adulthood. After age 30每45, however, the resorption and formation processes become imbalanced, and resorption exceeds formation. This imbalance may begin at different ages and varies at different skeletal sites; it becomes exaggerated in women after menopause. Excessive bone loss can be due to an increase in osteoclastic activity and/or a decrease in osteoblastic activity. In addition, an increase in remodeling activation frequency, and thus the number of remodeling sites, can magnify the small imbalance seen at each remodeling unit. Increased recruitment of bone remodeling sites produces a reversible reduction in bone tissue but also can result in permanent loss of tissue and disrupted skeletal architecture. In trabecular bone, if the osteoclasts penetrate trabeculae, they leave no template for new bone formation to occur, and, consequently, rapid bone loss ensues and cancellous connectivity becomes impaired. A higher number of remodeling sites increases the likelihood of this event. In cortical bone, increased activation of remodeling creates more porous bone. The effect of this increased porosity on cortical bone strength may be modest if the overall diameter of the bone is not changed. However, decreased apposition of new bone on the periosteal surface coupled with increased endocortical resorption of bone decreases the biomechanical strength of long bones. Even a slight exaggeration in normal bone loss increases the risk of osteoporosis-related fractures because of the architectural changes that occur.

Calcium Nutrition

Peak bone mass may be impaired by inadequate calcium intake during growth among other nutritional factors (calories, protein, and other minerals), leading to increased risk of osteoporosis later in life. During the adult phase of life, insufficient calcium intake contributes to relative secondary hyperparathyroidism and an increase in the rate of bone remodeling to maintain normal serum calcium levels. PTH stimulates the hydroxylation of vitamin D in the kidney, leading to increased levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] and enhanced gastrointestinal calcium absorption. PTH also reduces renal calcium loss. Although these are all appropriate compensatory homeostatic responses for adjusting calcium economy, the long-term effects are detrimental to the skeleton because the increased remodeling rates and the ongoing imbalance between resorption and formation at remodeling sites combine to accelerate loss of bone tissue.

Total daily calcium intakes <400 mg are detrimental to the skeleton, and intakes in the range of 600每800 mg, which is about the average intake among adults in the United States, are also probably suboptimal. The recommended daily required intake of 1000每1200 mg for adults accommodates population heterogeneity in controlling calcium balance (Chap. 73).

Vitamin D

(See also Chap. 352) Severe vitamin D deficiency causes rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. However, there is accumulating evidence that vitamin D insufficiency may be more prevalent than previously thought, particularly among individuals at increased risk such as the elderly; those living in northern latitudes; and individuals with poor nutrition, malabsorption, or chronic liver or renal disease. Dark-skinned individuals are also at high risk of vitamin D deficiency. An expert consensus panel has suggested that the accepted levels for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] have been set too low and that optimal targets for serum 25(OH)D are >75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL). To achieve this level for most adults requires an intake of 800每1000 units/d, particularly in individuals who avoid sunlight or routinely use ultraviolet-blocking lotions. Vitamin D insufficiency leads to compensatory secondary hyperparathyroidism and is an important risk factor for osteoporosis and fractures. Some studies have shown that >50% of inpatients on a general medical service exhibit biochemical features of vitamin D deficiency, including increased levels of PTH and alkaline phosphatase and lower levels of ionized calcium. In women living in northern latitudes, vitamin D levels decline during the winter months. This is associated with seasonal bone loss, reflecting increased bone turnover. Even among healthy ambulatory individuals, mild vitamin D deficiency is increasing in prevalence. Treatment with vitamin D can return levels to normal [>75 米mol/L (30 ng/mL)] and prevent the associated increase in bone remodeling, bone loss, and fractures. Reduced fracture rates also have been documented among individuals in northern latitudes who have greater vitamin D intake and have higher 25(OH)D levels (see below). Vitamin D adequacy also may affect risk and/or severity of other diseases, including cancers (colorectal, prostate, and breast), autoimmune diseases, and diabetes.

Estrogen Status

Estrogen deficiency probably causes bone loss by two distinct but interrelated mechanisms: (1) activation of new bone remodeling sites and (2) exaggeration of the imbalance between bone formation and resorption. The change in activation frequency causes a transient bone loss until a new steady state between resorption and formation is achieved. The remodeling imbalance, however, results in a permanent decrement in mass. In addition, the very presence of more remodeling sites in the skeleton increases the probability that trabeculae will be penetrated, eliminating the template on which new bone can be formed and accelerating the loss of bony tissue.

The most common estrogen-deficient state is the cessation of ovarian function at the time of menopause, which occurs on average at age 51 (Chap. 348). Thus, with current life expectancy, an average woman will spend about 30 years without an ovarian supply of estrogen. The mechanism by which estrogen deficiency causes bone loss is summarized in Fig. 354-5. Marrow cells (macrophages, monocytes, osteoclast precursors, mast cells) as well as bone cells (osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteoclasts) express ERs 汐 and 汕. Loss of estrogen increases production of RANKL and may reduce production of osteoprotegerin, increasing osteoclast recruitment. Estrogen also may play an important role in determining the life span of bone cells by controlling the rate of apoptosis. Thus, in situations of estrogen deprivation, the life span of osteoblasts may be decreased, whereas the longevity and activity of osteoclasts are increased.

Since remodeling is initiated at the surface of bone, it follows that trabecular bone〞which has a considerably larger surface area (80% of the total) than cortical bone〞will be affected preferentially by estrogen deficiency. Fractures occur earliest at sites where trabecular bone contributes most to bone strength; consequently, vertebral fractures are the most common early consequence of estrogen deficiency.

Physical Activity

Inactivity such as prolonged bed rest or paralysis, results in significant bone loss. Concordantly, athletes have higher bone mass than does the general population. These changes in skeletal mass are most marked when the stimulus begins during growth and before the age of puberty. Adults are less capable than children of increasing bone mass after restoration of physical activity. Epidemiologic data support the beneficial effects on the skeleton of chronic high levels of physical activity. Fracture risk is lower in rural communities and in countries where physical activity is maintained into old age. However, when exercise is initiated during adult life, the effects of moderate exercise on the skeleton are modest, with a bone mass increase of 1每2% in short-term studies of <2 years' duration. It is argued that more active individuals are less likely to fall and are more capable of protecting themselves upon falling, thereby reducing fracture risk.

Chronic Disease

Various genetic and acquired diseases are associated with an increase in the risk of osteoporosis (Table 354-2). Mechanisms that contribute to bone loss are unique for each disease and typically result from multiple factors, including nutrition, reduced physical activity levels, and factors that affect rates of bone remodeling. In most, but not all, circumstances the primary diagnosis is made before osteoporosis presents clinically.

Medications

A large number of medications used in clinical practice have potentially detrimental effects on the skeleton (Table 354-3). Glucocorticoids are the most common cause of medication-induced osteoporosis. It is often not possible to determine the extent to which osteoporosis is related to glucocorticoid or to other factors, as treatment is superimposed on the effects of the primary disease, which in itself may be associated with bone loss (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Excessive doses of thyroid hormone can accelerate bone remodeling and result in bone loss.

Glucocorticoids Excessive thyroxine 
Cyclosporine Aluminum 
Cytotoxic drugs Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists 
Anticonvulsants Heparin 
Excessive alcohol Lithium 
Aromatase inhibitors   
 

 

Other medications have less detrimental effects on the skeleton than pharmacologic doses of glucocorticoids. Anticonvulsants are thought to increase the risk of osteoporosis, although many affected individuals have concomitant insufficiency of 1,25(OH)2D, as some anticonvulsants induce the cytochrome P450 system and vitamin D metabolism. Patients undergoing transplantation are at high risk for rapid bone loss and fracture not only from glucocorticoids but also from treatment with other immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus (FK506). In addition these patients often have underlying metabolic abnormalities such as hepatic or renal failure, that predispose to bone loss.

Aromatase inhibitors, which potently block the aromatase enzyme that converts androgens and other adrenal precursors to estrogen, reduce circulating postmenopausal estrogen levels dramatically. These agents, which are used in various stages for breast cancer treatment, also have been shown to have a detrimental effect on bone density and risk of fracture.

Cigarette Consumption

The use of cigarettes over a long period has detrimental effects on bone mass. These effects may be mediated directly by toxic effects on osteoblasts or indirectly by modifying estrogen metabolism. On average, cigarette smokers reach menopause 1每2 years earlier than the general population. Cigarette smoking also produces secondary effects that can modulate skeletal status, including intercurrent respiratory and other illnesses, frailty, decreased exercise, poor nutrition, and the need for additional medications (e.g., glucocorticoids for lung disease).
 
Measurement of Bone Mass

Several noninvasive techniques are available for estimating skeletal mass or density. They include dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), single-energy x-ray absorptiometry (SXA), quantitative CT, and ultrasound (US).

DXA is a highly accurate x-ray technique that has become the standard for measuring bone density in most centers. Though it can be used for measurement in any skeletal site, clinical determinations usually are made of the lumbar spine and hip. Portable DXA machines have been developed that measure the heel (calcaneus), forearm (radius and ulna), or finger (phalanges). DXA also can be used to measure body composition. In the DXA technique, two x-ray energies are used to estimate the area of mineralized tissue, and the mineral content is divided by the area, which partially corrects for body size. However, this correction is only partial since DXA is a two-dimensional scanning technique and cannot estimate the depth or posteroanterior length of the bone. Thus, small people tend to have lower than average bone mineral density (BMD). Bone spurs, which are common in osteoarthritis, tend to falsely increase bone density of the spine and are a particular problem in measuring the spine in older individuals. Because DXA instrumentation is provided by several different manufacturers, the output varies in absolute terms. Consequently, it has become standard practice to relate the results to "normal" values by using T-scores, which compare individual results to those in a young population that is matched for race and sex. Z-scores compare individual results to those of an age-matched population that also is matched for race and sex. Thus, a 60-year-old woman with a Z-score of 每1 (1 SD below mean for age) has a T-score of 每2.5 (2.5 SD below mean for a young control group) (Fig. 354-6). A T-score below 每2.5 in the lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip is taken as a diagnosis of osteoporosis.

Figure 354-6

CT is used primarily to measure the spine and, more recently, the hip. Peripheral CT is used to measure bone in the forearm or tibia. The results obtained from CT are different from all others currently available since this technique is three-dimensional and can provide a true density (mass of bone tissue per unit volume). CT also can specifically analyze trabecular bone and cortical bone content and volume separately. However, CT remains expensive, involves greater radiation exposure, and is less reproducible than DXA. A new technique employing high-resolution CT scanning called Xtreme CT also can provide information on skeletal architecture, including cancellous connectivity.

US is used to measure bone mass by calculating the attenuation of the signal as it passes through bone or the speed with which it traverses the bone. It is unclear whether US assesses properties of bone other than mass (e.g., quality), but this is a potential advantage of the technique. Because of its relatively low cost and mobility, US is amenable for use as a screening procedure.

All these techniques for measuring BMD have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the basis of their capacity to predict fracture risk. The hip is the preferred site of measurement in most individuals, since it predicts the risk of hip fracture, the most important consequence of osteoporosis, better than any other bone density measurement site. When hip measurements are performed by DXA, the spine can be measured at the same time. In younger individuals such as perimenopausal or early postmenopausal women, spine measurements may be the most sensitive indicator of bone loss.

When to Measure Bone Mass

Clinical guidelines have been developed for the use of bone densitometry in clinical practice. The original National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines recommend bone mass measurements in postmenopausal women, assuming they have one or more risk factors for osteoporosis in addition to age, sex, and estrogen deficiency. The guidelines further recommend that bone mass measurement be considered in all women by age 65, a position ratified by the U.S. Preventive Health Services Task Force. Criteria approved for Medicare reimbursement of BMD are summarized in Table 354-4.

When to Treat Based on Bone Mass Results

Most guidelines suggest that patients be considered for treatment when BMD is >2.5 SD below the mean value for young adults (T-score ≒每2.5), a level consistent with the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Treatment also should also be considered in postmenopausal women with fracture risk factors even if BMD is not in the osteoporosis range. Risk factors (age, prior fracture, family history of hip fracture, low body weight, cigarette consumption, excessive alcohol use, steroid use, and rheumatoid arthritis) can be combined with BMD to assess the likelihood of a fracture over a 5- or 10-year period. Treatment thresholds depend on cost-effectiveness analyses but probably is 1% per year of risk in the United States.
 
Treatment Osteoporosis

The perimenopausal transition is a good opportunity to initiate a discussion about risk factors for osteoporosis and consideration of indications for a BMD test. A careful history and physical examination should be performed to identify risk factors for osteoporosis. A low Z-score increases the suspicion of a secondary disease. Height loss >2.5每3.8 cm (>1每1.5 in.) is an indication for radiography or vertebral fracture assessment by DXA to rule out asymptomatic vertebral fractures, as is the presence of significant kyphosis or back pain, particularly if it began after menopause. For patients who present with fractures, it is important to ensure that the fractures are not caused by an underlying malignancy. Usually this is clear on routine radiography, but on occasion, CT, MRI, or radionuclide scans may be necessary.

Routine Laboratory Evaluation

There is no established algorithm for the evaluation of women who present with osteoporosis. A general evaluation that includes complete blood count, serum and 24-h urine calcium, and renal and hepatic function tests is useful for identifying selected secondary causes of low bone mass, particularly for women with fractures or very low Z-scores. An elevated serum calcium level suggests hyperparathyroidism or malignancy, whereas a reduced serum calcium level may reflect malnutrition and osteomalacia. In the presence of hypercalcemia, a serum PTH level differentiates between hyperparathyroidism (PTH∥) and malignancy (PTH∣), and a high PTHrP level can help document the presence of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (Chap. 353). A low urine calcium (<50 mg/24 h) suggests osteomalacia, malnutrition, or malabsorption; a high urine calcium (>300 mg/24 h) is indicative of hypercalciuria and must be investigated further. Hypercalciuria occurs primarily in three situations: (1) a renal calcium leak, which is more common in males with osteoporosis; (2) absorptive hypercalciuria, which can be idiopathic or associated with increased 1,25(OH)2D in granulomatous disease; or (3) hematologicmalignancies or conditions associated with excessive bone turnover such as Paget's disease, hyperparathyroidism, and hyperthyroidism.

Individuals who have osteoporosis-related fractures or bone density in the osteoporotic range should have a measurement of serum 25(OH)D level, since the intake of vitamin D required to achieve a target level >32 ng/mL is highly variable. Vitamin D levels should be optimized in all individuals being treated for osteoporosis. Hyperthyroidism should be evaluated by measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).

When there is clinical suspicion of Cushing's syndrome, urinary free cortisol levels or a fasting serum cortisol should be measured after overnight dexamethasone. When bowel disease, malabsorption, or malnutrition is suspected, serum albumin, cholesterol, and a complete blood count should be checked. Asymptomatic malabsorption may be heralded by anemia (macrocytic〞vitamin B12 or folate deficiency; microcytic〞iron deficiency) or low serum cholesterol or urinary calcium levels. If these or other features suggest malabsorption, further evaluation is required. Asymptomatic celiac disease with selective malabsorption is being found with increasing frequency; the diagnosis can be made by testing for antigliadin, antiendomysial, or transglutaminase antibodies but may require endoscopic biopsy. A trial of a gluten-free diet can be confirmatory (Chap. 294). When osteoporosis is found associated with symptoms of rash, multiple allergies, diarrhea, or flushing, mastocytosis should be excluded by using 24-h urine histamine collection or serum tryptase.

Myeloma can masquerade as generalized osteoporosis, although it more commonly presents with bone pain and characteristic "punched-out" lesions on radiography. Serum and urine electrophoresis and evaluation for light chains in urine are required to exclude this diagnosis. A bone marrow biopsy may be required to rule out myeloma (in patients with equivocal electrophoretic results) and also can be used to exclude mastocytosis, leukemia, and other marrow infiltrative disorders such as Gaucher's disease.

Bone Biopsy

Tetracycline labeling of the skeleton allows determination of the rate of remodeling as well as evaluation for other metabolic bone diseases. The current use of BMD tests, in combination with hormonal evaluation and biochemical markers of bone remodeling, has largely replaced the clinical use of bone biopsy, although it remains an important tool in clinical research.

Biochemical Markers

Several biochemical tests are available that provide an index of the overall rate of bone remodeling (Table 354-5). Biochemical markers usually are characterized as those related primarily to bone formation or bone resorption. These tests measure the overall state of bone remodeling at a single point in time. Clinical use of these tests has been hampered by biologic variability (in part related to circadian rhythm) as well as analytic variability, although the latter is improving.

For the most part, remodeling markers do not predict rates of bone loss well enough for this information to be used clinically. However, markers of bone resorption may help in the prediction of fracture risk, independently of bone density, particularly in older individuals. In women ≡65 years, when bone density results are greater than the usual treatment thresholds noted above, a high level of bone resorption should prompt consideration of treatment. The primary use of biochemical markers is for monitoring the response to treatment. With the introduction of antiresorptive therapeutic agents, bone remodeling declines rapidly, with the fall in resorption occurring earlier than the fall in formation. Inhibition of bone resorption is maximal within 3每6 months. Thus, measurement of bone resorption before initiating therapy and 4每6 months after starting therapy provides an earlier estimate of patient response than does bone densitometry. A decline in resorptive markers can be ascertained after treatment with bisphosphonates or estrogen; this effect is less marked after treatment with either raloxifene or intranasal calcitonin. A biochemical marker response to therapy is particularly useful for asymptomatic patients and may help ensure long-term adherence to treatment. Bone turnover markers are also useful in monitoring the effects of 1-34hPTH, or teriparatide, which rapidly increases bone formation and later bone resorption.

Treatment: Osteoporosis

Management of Osteoporotic Fractures

Treatment of a patient with osteoporosis frequently involves management of acute fractures as well as treatment of the underlying disease. Hip fractures almost always require surgical repair if the patient is to become ambulatory again. Depending on the location and severity of the fracture, condition of the neighboring joint, and general status of the patient, procedures may include open reduction and internal fixation with pins and plates, hemiarthroplasties, and total arthroplasties. These surgical procedures are followed by intense rehabilitation in an attempt to return patients to their prefracture functional level. Long bone fractures often require either external or internal fixation. Other fractures (e.g., vertebral, rib, and pelvic fractures) usually are managed with supportive care, requiring no specific orthopedic treatment.

Only 25每30% of vertebral compression fractures present with sudden-onset back pain. For acutely symptomatic fractures, treatment with analgesics is required, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and/or acetaminophen, sometimes with the addition of a narcotic agent (codeine or oxycodone). A few small, randomized clinical trials suggest that calcitonin may reduce pain related to acute vertebral compression fracture. A recently developed technique involves percutaneous injection of artificial cement (polymethylmethacrylate) into the vertebral body (vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty); this offers significant immediate pain relief in the majority of patients. Long-term effects are unknown, and conclusions are based on observational studies in patients with severe persistent back pain from acute or subacute vertebral fractures. There have been no long-term randomized controlled trials of either vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty to date. Short periods of bed rest may be helpful for pain management, but in general, early mobilization is recommended as it helps prevent further bone loss associated with immobilization. Occasionally, use of a soft elastic-style brace may facilitate earlier mobilization. Muscle spasms often occur with acute compression fractures and can be treated with muscle relaxants and heat treatments.

Severe pain usually resolves within 6每10 weeks. Chronic pain is probably not bony in origin; instead, it is related to abnormal strain on muscles, ligaments, and tendons and to secondary facet-joint arthritis associated with alterations in thoracic and/or abdominal shape. Chronic pain is difficult to treat effectively and may require analgesics, sometimes including narcotic analgesics. Frequent intermittent rest in a supine or semireclining position is often required to allow the soft tissues, which are under tension, to relax. Back-strengthening exercises (paraspinal) may be beneficial. Heat treatments help relax muscles and reduce the muscular component of discomfort. Various physical modalities, such as US and transcutaneous nerve stimulation, may be beneficial in some patients. Pain also occurs in the neck region, not as a result of compression fractures (which almost never occur in the cervical spine as a result of osteoporosis) but because of chronic strain associated with trying to elevate the head in a person with a severe thoracic kyphosis.

Multiple vertebral fractures often are associated with psychological symptoms; this is not always appreciated. The changes in body configuration and back pain can lead to marked loss of self-image and a secondary depression. Altered balance, precipitated by the kyphosis and the anterior movement of the body's center of gravity, leads to a fear of falling, a consequent tendency to remain indoors, and the onset of social isolation. These symptoms sometimes can be alleviated by family support and/or psychotherapy. Medication may be necessary when depressive features are present.

Management of the Underlying Disease

Risk Factor Reduction

Assessment of fracture risk can be estimated by using FRAX calculators that are available online (http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/tool.jsp?locationValue=9) (Fig. 354-7). Patients should be thoroughly educated to reduce the impact of modifiable risk factors associated with bone loss and falling. Medications should be reviewed to ensure that all are necessary. Glucocorticoid medication, if present, should be evaluated to determine that it is truly indicated and is being given in doses that are as low as possible. For those on thyroid hormone replacement, TSH testing should be performed to determine that an excessive dose is not being used, as thyrotoxicosis can be associated with increased bone loss. In patients who smoke, efforts should be made to facilitate smoking cessation. Reducing risk factors for falling also include alcohol abuse treatment and a review of the medical regimen for any drugs that might be associated with orthostatic hypotension and/or sedation, including hypnotics and anxiolytics. If nocturia occurs, the frequency should be reduced, if possible (e.g., by decreasing or modifying diuretic use), as arising in the middle of sleep is a common precipitant of a fall. Patients should be instructed about environmental safety with regard to eliminating exposed wires, curtain strings, slippery rugs, and mobile tables. Avoiding stocking feet on wood floors, checking carpet condition (particularly on stairs), and providing good light in paths to bathrooms and outside the home are important preventive measures. Treatment for impaired vision is recommended, particularly a problem with depth perception, which is specifically associated with increased falling risk. Elderly patients with neurologic impairment (e.g., stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease) are particularly at risk of falling and require specialized supervision and care.

Nutritional Recommendations

Calcium

A large body of data indicates that optimal calcium intake reduces bone loss and suppresses bone turnover. Recommended intakes from an Institute of Medicine report are shown in Table 354-6. The National Health and Nutritional Evaluation Studies (NHANES) have consistently documented that average calcium intakes fall considerably short of these recommendations. The preferred source of calcium is dairy products and other foods, but many patients require calcium supplementation. Food sources of calcium are dairy products (milk, yogurt, and cheese) and fortified foods such as certain cereals, waffles, snacks, juices, and crackers. Some of these fortified foods contain as much calcium per serving as milk.

Young children (1每3 years) 500

If a calcium supplement is required, it should be taken in doses ≒600 mg at a time, as the calcium absorption fraction decreases at higher doses. Calcium supplements should be calculated on the basis of the elemental calcium content of the supplement, not the weight of the calcium salt (Table 354-7). Calcium supplements containing carbonate are best taken with food since they require acid for solubility. Calcium citrate supplements can be taken at any time. To confirm bioavailability, calcium supplements can be placed in distilled vinegar. They should dissolve within 30 min.

Several controlled clinical trials of calcium plus vitamin D have confirmed reductions in clinical fractures, including fractures of the hip (20每30% risk reduction). All recent studies of pharmacologic agents have been conducted in the context of calcium replacement (㊣ vitamin D). Thus, it is standard practice to ensure an adequate calcium and vitamin D intake in patients with osteoporosis whether they are receiving additional pharmacologic therapy or not. A systematic review confirmed a greater BMD response to antiresorptive therapy when calcium intake was adequate.

Although side effects from supplemental calcium are minimal (eructation and constipation mostly with carbonate salts), individuals with a history of kidney stones should have a 24-h urine calcium determination before starting increased calcium to avoid significant hypercalciuria.

Vitamin D

Vitamin D is synthesized in skin under the influence of heat and ultraviolet light (Chap. 352). However, large segments of the population do not obtain sufficient vitamin D to maintain what is now considered an adequate supply [serum 25(OH)D consistently >75 米mol/L (30 ng/mL)]. Since vitamin D supplementation at doses that would achieve these serum levels is safe and inexpensive, the Institute of Medicine recommends daily intakes of 200 IU for adults <50 years of age, 400 IU for those 50每70 years, and 600 IU for those >70 years. Multivitamin tablets usually contain 400 IU, and many calcium supplements also contain vitamin D. Some data suggest that higher doses (≡1000 IU) may be required in the elderly and chronically ill.

Other Nutrients

Other nutrients such as salt, high animal protein intakes, and caffeine may have modest effects on calcium excretion or absorption. Adequate vitamin K status is required for optimal carboxylation of osteocalcin. States in which vitamin K nutrition or metabolism is impaired, such as with long-term warfarin therapy, have been associated with reduced bone mass. Research concerning cola intake is controversial but suggests a possible link to reduced bone mass through factors that are independent of caffeine.

Magnesium is abundant in foods, and magnesium deficiency is quite rare in the absence of a serious chronic disease. Magnesium supplementation may be warranted in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, chemotherapy, severe diarrhea, malnutrition, or alcoholism. Dietary phytoestrogens, which are derived primarily from soy products and legumes [e.g., garbanzo beans (chickpeas) and lentils], exert some estrogenic activity but are insufficiently potent to justify their use in place of a pharmacologic agent in the treatment of osteoporosis.

Patients with hip fractures are often frail and relatively malnourished. Some data suggest an improved outcome in such patients when they are provided calorie and protein supplementation. Excessive protein intake can increase renal calcium excretion, but this can be corrected by an adequate calcium intake.

Exercise

Exercise in young individuals increases the likelihood that they will attain the maximal genetically determined peak bone mass. Meta-analyses of studies performed in postmenopausal women indicate that weight-bearing exercise prevents bone loss but does not appear to result in substantial gain of bone mass. This beneficial effect wanes if exercise is discontinued. Most of the studies are short term, and a more substantial effect on bone mass is likely if exercise is continued over a long period. Exercise also has beneficial effects on neuromuscular function, and it improves coordination, balance, and strength, thereby reducing the risk of falling. A walking program is a practical way to start. Other activities such as dancing, racquet sports, cross-country skiing, and use of gym equipment, are also recommended, depending on the patient's personal preference and general condition. Even women who cannot walk benefit from swimming or water exercises, not so much for the effects on bone, which are quite minimal, but because of effects on muscle. Exercise habits should be consistent, optimally at least three times a week.

Pharmacologic Therapies

Until fairly recently, estrogen treatment, either by itself or in concert with a progestin, was the primary therapeutic agent for prevention or treatment of osteoporosis. However, a number of new drugs have appeared, and more are expected in the near future. Some are agents that specifically treat osteoporosis (bisphosphonates, calcitonin, PTH); others such as selective estrogen response modulators (SERMs), have broader effects. The availability of these drugs allows therapy to be tailored to the needs of an individual patient.

Estrogens

A large body of clinical trial data indicates that various types of estrogens (conjugated equine estrogens, estradiol, estrone, esterified estrogens, ethinyl estradiol, and mestranol) reduce bone turnover, prevent bone loss, and induce small increases in bone mass of the spine, hip, and total body. The effects of estrogen are seen in women with natural or surgical menopause and in late postmenopausal women with or without established osteoporosis. Estrogens are efficacious when administered orally or transdermally. For both oral and transdermal routes of administration, combined estrogen/progestin preparations are now available in many countries, obviating the problem of taking two tablets or using a patch and oral progestin. One large study, referred to as PEPI (Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Intervention Trial), indicated that C-21 progestins alone do not augment the effect of standard estrogen doses on bone mass.

Dose of Estrogen

For oral estrogens, the standard recommended doses have been 0.3 mg/d for esterified estrogens, 0.625 mg/d for conjugated equine estrogens, and 5 米g/d for ethinyl estradiol. For transdermal estrogen, the commonly used dose supplies 50 米g estradiol per day, but a lower dose may be appropriate for some individuals. Dose-response data for conjugated equine estrogens indicate that lower doses (0.3 and 0.45 mg/d) are effective. Doses even lower have been associated with bone mass protection.

Fracture Data

Epidemiologic databases indicate that women who take estrogen replacement have a 50% reduction, on average, of osteoporotic fractures, including hip fractures. The beneficial effect of estrogen is greatest among those who start replacement early and continue the treatment; the benefit declines after discontinuation to the extent that there is no residual protective effect against fracture by 10 years after discontinuation. The first clinical trial evaluating fractures as secondary outcomes, the Heart and Estrogen-Progestin Replacement Study (HERS) trial, showed no effect of hormone therapy on hip or other clinical fractures in women with established coronary artery disease. These data made the results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) exceedingly important (Chap. 348). The estrogen-progestin arm of the WHI in >16,000 postmenopausal healthy women indicated that hormone therapy reduces the risk of hip and clinical spine fracture by 34% and that of all clinical fractures by 24%.

A few smaller clinical trials have evaluated spine fracture occurrence as an outcome with estrogen therapy. They have consistently shown that estrogen treatment reduces the incidence of vertebral compression fracture.

The WHI has provided a vast amount of data on the multisystemic effects of hormone therapy. Although earlier observational studies suggested that estrogen replacement might reduce heart disease, the WHI showed that combined estrogen-progestin treatment increased risk of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction by 29%, confirming data from the HERS study. Other important relative risks included a 40% increase in stroke, a 100% increase in venous thromboembolic disease, and a 26% increase in risk of breast cancer. Subsequent analyses have confirmed the increased risk of stroke and shown a twofold increase in dementia. Benefits other than the fracture reductions noted above included a 37% reduction in the risk of colon cancer. These relative risks have to be interpreted in light of absolute risk (Fig. 354-8). For example, out of 10,000 women treated with estrogen-progestin for 1 year, there will be 8 excess heart attacks, 8 excess breast cancers, 18 excess venous thromboembolic events, 5 fewer hip fractures, 44 fewer clinical fractures, and 6 fewer colorectal cancers. These numbers must be multiplied by years of hormone treatment. There was no effect of hormone treatment on the risk of uterine cancer or total mortality.

It is important to note that these WHI findings apply specifically to hormone treatment in the form of conjugated equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate. The relative benefits and risks of unopposed estrogen in women who had hysterectomies vary somewhat. They still show benefits against fracture occurrence and increased risk of venous thrombosis and stroke, similar in magnitude to the risks for combined hormone therapy. In contrast, though, the estrogen-only arm of WHI indicated no increased risk of heart attack or breast cancer. The data suggest that at least some of the detrimental effects of combined therapy are related to the progestin component.

Mode of Action

Two subtypes of ERs, 汐 and 汕, have been identified in bone and other tissues. Cells of monocyte lineage express both ER汐 and ER汕, as do osteoblasts. Estrogen-mediated effects vary with the receptor type. Using ER knockout mouse models, elimination of ER汐 produces a modest reduction in bone mass, whereas mutation of ER汕 has less of an effect on bone. A male patient with a homozygous mutation of ER汐 had markedly decreased bone density as well as abnormalities in epiphyseal closure, confirming the important role of ER汐 in bone biology. The mechanism of estrogen action in bone is an area of active investigation (Fig. 354-5). Although data are conflicting, estrogens may inhibit osteoclasts directly. However, the majority of estrogen (and androgen) effects on bone resorption are mediated indirectly through paracrine factors produced by osteoblasts. These actions include (1) increasing IGF-I and TGF-汕 and (2) suppressing IL-1 (汐 and 汕), IL-6, TNF-汐, and osteocalcin synthesis. The indirect estrogen actions primarily decrease bone resorption.

Progestins

In women with a uterus, daily progestin or cyclical progestins at least 12 days per month are prescribed in combination with estrogens to reduce the risk of uterine cancer. Medroxyprogesterone acetate and norethindrone acetate blunt the high-density lipoprotein response to estrogen, but micronized progesterone does not. Neither medroxyprogesterone acetate nor micronized progesterone appears to have an independent effect on bone; at lower doses of estrogen, norethindrone acetate may have an additive benefit. On breast tissue, progestins may increase the risk of breast cancer.

Serms

Two SERMs are used currently in postmenopausal women: raloxifene, which is approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, and tamoxifen, which is approved for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer.

Tamoxifen reduces bone turnover and bone loss in postmenopausal women compared with placebo groups. These findings support the concept that tamoxifen acts as an estrogenic agent in bone. There are limited data on the effect of tamoxifen on fracture risk, but the Breast Cancer Prevention study indicated a possible reduction in clinical vertebral, hip, and Colles' fractures. The major benefit of tamoxifen is on breast cancer occurrence. The breast cancer prevention trial indicated that tamoxifen administration over 4每5 years reduced the incidence of new invasive and noninvasive breast cancer by 45% in women at increased risk of breast cancer. The incidence of ER-positive breast cancers was reduced by 65%. Tamoxifen increases the risk of uterine cancer in postmenopausal women, limiting its use for breast cancer prevention in women at low or moderate risk.

Raloxifene (60 mg/d) has effects on bone turnover and bone mass that are very similar to those of tamoxifen, indicating that this agent is also estrogenic on the skeleton. The effect of raloxifene on bone density (+1.4每2.8% versus placebo in the spine, hip, and total body) is somewhat less than that seen with standard doses of estrogens. Raloxifene reduces the occurrence of vertebral fracture by 30每50%, depending on the population; however, there are no data confirming that raloxifene can reduce the risk of nonvertebral fractures over 8 years of observation.

Raloxifene, like tamoxifen and estrogen, has effects in other organ systems. The most beneficial effect appears to be a reduction in invasive breast cancer (mainly decreased ER-positive) occurrence of 65% in women who take raloxifene compared to placebo. In a head-to-head study raloxifene was as effective as tamoxifen in preventing breast cancer in high-risk women, but in a separate study it had no effect on heart disease in women with increased risk for this outcome. In contrast to tamoxifen, raloxifene is not associated with an increase in the risk of uterine cancer or benign uterine disease. Raloxifene increases the occurrence of hot flashes but reduces serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipoprotein(a), and fibrinogen.

Mode of Action of Serms

All SERMs bind to the ER, but each agent produces a unique receptor-drug conformation. As a result, specific coactivator or co-repressor proteins are bound to the receptor (Chap. 338), resulting in differential effects on gene transcription that vary depending on other transcription factors present in the cell. Another aspect of selectivity is the affinity of each SERM for the different ER汐 and ER汕 subtypes, which are expressed differentially in various tissues. These tissue-selective effects of SERMs offer the possibility of tailoring estrogen therapy to best meet the needs and risk factor profile of an individual patient.

Bisphosphonates

Alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate are approved for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Risedronate and alendronate are approved for the treatment of steroid-induced osteoporosis, and risedronate also is approved for prevention of steroid-induced osteoporosis. Both alendronate and risedronate are approved for treatment of osteoporosis in men.

Alendronate has been shown to decrease bone turnover and increase bone mass in the spine by up to 8% versus placebo and by 6% versus placebo in the hip. Multiple trials have evaluated its effect on fracture occurrence. The Fracture Intervention Trial provided evidence in >2000 women with prevalent vertebral fractures that daily alendronate treatment (5 mg/d for 2 years and 10 mg/d for 9 months afterward) reduces vertebral fracture risk by about 50%, multiple vertebral fractures by up to 90%, and hip fractures by up to 50%. Several subsequent trials have confirmed these findings (Figs. 354-9 and 354-10). For example, in a study of >1900 women with low bone mass treated with alendronate (10 mg/d) versus placebo, the incidence of all nonvertebral fractures was reduced by 47% after only 1 year.

Figure 354-10

 
 
 
Effects of two doses of raloxifene on incident vertebral fractures in the MORE trial. (After B Ettinger et al: JAMA:282:637, 1999.)
 
 

Trials comparing once-weekly alendronate, 70 mg, with daily 10-mg dosing have shown equivalence with regard to bone mass and bone turnover responses. Consequently, once-weekly therapy generally is preferred because of the low incidence of gastrointestinal side effects and ease of administration. Alendronate should be given with a full glass of water before breakfast, as bisphosphonates are poorly absorbed. Because of the potential for esophageal irritation, alendronate is contraindicated in patients who have stricture or inadequate emptying of the esophagus. It is recommended that patients remain upright for at least 30 min after taking the medication to avoid esophageal irritation. Cases of esophagitis, esophageal ulcer, and esophageal stricture have been described, but the incidence appears to be low. In clinical trials, overall gastrointestinal symptomatology was no different with alendronate than with placebo. Alendronate is also available in a preparation that contains vitamin D.

Risedronate also reduces bone turnover and increases bone mass. Controlled clinical trials have demonstrated 40每50% reduction in vertebral fracture risk over 3 years, accompanied by a 40% reduction in clinical nonspine fractures. The only clinical trial specifically designed to evaluate hip fracture outcome (HIP) indicated that risedronate reduced hip fracture risk in women in their seventies with confirmed osteoporosis by 40%. In contrast, risedronate was not effective at reducing hip fracture occurrence in older women (80+ years) without proven osteoporosis. Studies have shown that 35 mg of risedronate administered once weekly is therapeutically equivalent to 5 mg/d. Patients should take risedronate with a full glass of plain water to facilitate delivery to the stomach and should not lie down for 30 min after taking the drug. The incidence of gastrointestinal side effects in trials with risedronate was similar to that of placebo.

Etidronate was the first bisphosphonate to be approved, initially for use in Paget's disease and hypercalcemia. This agent has also been used in osteoporosis trials of smaller magnitude than those performed for alendronate and risedronate but is not approved by the FDA for treatment of osteoporosis. Etidronate probably has some efficacy against vertebral fracture when given as an intermittent cyclical regimen (2 weeks on, 2.5 months off). Its effectiveness against nonvertebral fractures has not been studied.

Ibandronate is the third amino-bisphosphonate approved in the United States. Ibandronate (2.5 mg/d) has been shown in clinical trials to reduce vertebral fracture risk by 40% but with no overall effect on nonvertebral fractures. In a post hoc analysis of subjects with a femoral neck T-score of 每3 or below, ibandronate reduced the risk of nonvertebral fractures by 60%. In clinical trials, ibandronate doses of 150 mg/month PO or 3 mg every 3 months IV had greater effects on turnover and bone mass than did 2.5 mg/d. Patients should take oral ibandronate in the same way as other bisphosphonates, but with 1 h elapsing before other food or drink (other than plain water).

Zoledronic acid is a potent bisphosphonate with unique administration regimens (once yearly IV). Although it has not been approved for use in osteoporosis, the data suggest that it is highly effective in fracture risk reduction. In a study of >7000 women followed for 3 years, zoledronic acid (5 mg as a single IV infusion annually) reduced the risk of vertebral fractures by 70%, nonvertebral fractures by 25%, and hip fractures by 40%. These results were associated with less height loss and disability. In the treated population, there was an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (2%) and arthralgia and a 15% risk of fever in comparison to placebo.

Mode of Action

Bisphosphonates are structurally related to pyrophosphates, compounds that are incorporated into bone matrix. Bisphosphonates specifically impair osteoclast function and reduce osteoclast number, in part by inducing apoptosis. Recent evidence suggests that the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates also inhibit protein prenylation, one of the end products in the mevalonic acid pathway, by inhibiting the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase. This effect disrupts intracellular protein trafficking and ultimately may lead to apoptosis. Some bisphosphonates have very long retention in the skeleton and may exert long-term effects. The consequences of this, if any, are unknown. A phenomenon that has been called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been described, mostly in patients with cancer who are given high doses of zoledronic acid or pamidronate. A few cases have been described in patients with osteoporosis treated with oral bisphosphonates. The background incidence of ONJ in this population is not known, and thus the attributable risk for bisphosphonates is not clear, although it appears to be relatively low.

Calcitonin

Calcitonin is a polypeptide hormone produced by the thyroid gland (Chap. 353). Its physiologic role is unclear as no skeletal disease has been described in association with calcitonin deficiency or excess. Calcitonin preparations are approved by the FDA for Paget's disease, hypercalcemia, and osteoporosis in women >5 years past menopause.

Injectable calcitonin produces small increments in bone mass of the lumbar spine. However, difficulty of administration and frequent reactions, including nausea and facial flushing, make general use limited. A nasal spray containing calcitonin (200 IU/d) is available for treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. One study suggests that nasal calcitonin produces small increments in bone mass and a small reduction in new vertebral fractures in calcitonin-treated patients versus those on calcium alone. There has been no proven effectiveness against nonvertebral fractures. An oral preparation of calcitonin recently was approved for use in osteoporosis.

Calcitonin is not indicated for prevention of osteoporosis and is not sufficiently potent to prevent bone loss in early postmenopausal women. Calcitonin might have an analgesic effect on bone pain, both in the subcutaneous and possibly in the nasal form.

Mode of Action

Calcitonin suppresses osteoclast activity by direct action on the osteoclast calcitonin receptor. Osteoclasts exposed to calcitonin cannot maintain their active ruffled border, which normally maintains close contact with underlying bone.

Denosumab

A novel agent that was given twice yearly by SC administration in a randomized controlled trial in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis has been shown to increase BMD in the spine, hip, and forearm and reduce vertebral, hip, and nonvertebral fractures over a 3-year period by 70, 40, and 20%, respectively (Fig. 354-11). Other clinical trials indicate ability to increase bone mass in postmenopausal women with low bone mass (above osteoporosis range) and in postmenopausal women with breast cancer treated with hormonal agents. Furthermore, a study of men with prostate cancer treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy indicated the ability of denosumab to improve bone mass and reduce vertebral fracture occurrence. Denosumab was approved by the FDA in 2010 for the treatment of postmenopausal women who have a high risk for osteoporotic fractures, including those with a history of fracture or multiple risk factors for fracture, and those who have failed or are intolerant to other osteoporosis therapy.

Effects of denosumab on new vertebral fractures A. and times to nonvertebral and hip fracture B. and C. (After SR Cummings et al: N Engl J Med:361:756, 2009.)
 
 

Mode of Action

Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody to RANKL, the final common effector of osteoclast formation, activity, and survival. Denosumab binds to RANKL, inhibiting its ability to initiate formation of mature osteoclasts from osteoclast precursors and to bring mature osteoclasts to the bone surface and initiate bone resorption. Denosumab also plays a role in reducing the survival of the osteoclast. Through these actions on the osteoclast, denosumab induces potent antiresorptive action, as assessed biochemically and histomorphometrically, and may contribute to the occurrence of ONJ. Serious adverse reactions include hypocalcemia, infections, and dermatologic reactions such as dermatitis, rashes, and eczema.

Parathyroid Hormone

Endogenous PTH is an 84-amino-acid peptide that is largely responsible for calcium homeostasis (Chap. 353). Although chronic elevation of PTH, as occurs in hyperparathyroidism, is associated with bone loss (particularly cortical bone), PTH also can exert anabolic effects on bone. Consistent with this, some observational studies have indicated that mild elevations in PTH are associated with maintenance of trabecular bone mass. On the basis of these findings, several clinical trials have been performed using an exogenous PTH analogue (1-34hPTH; teriparatide) that has been approved for the treatment of established osteoporosis in both men and women. The first randomized controlled trial in postmenopausal women showed that PTH, when superimposed on ongoing estrogen therapy, produced substantial increments in bone mass (13% over a 3-year period compared with estrogen alone) and reduced the risk of vertebral compression deformity. In the pivotal study (median, 19 months' duration), 20 米g PTH(1每34) daily by SC injection reduced vertebral fractures by 65% and nonvertebral fractures by 45% (Fig. 354-12). Treatment is administered as a single daily injection given for a maximum of 2 years. Teriparatide produces increases in bone mass and mediates architectural improvements in skeletal structure. These effects are lower when patients have been exposed previously to bisphosphonates, possibly in proportion to the potency of the antiresorptive effect. When 1每34hPTH is being considered for treatment-naive patients, it is best administered as monotherapy and followed by an antiresorptive agent such as a bisphosphonate.

Effects of teriparatide on new vertebral fractures A. and nonvertebral fragility fractures B. and C. (After RM Neer et al: N Engl J Med 344:1434, 2001.)
 
 

Side effects of teriparatide are generally mild and can include muscle pain, weakness, dizziness, headache, and nausea. Rodents given prolonged treatment with PTH in relatively high doses developed osteogenic sarcomas. One case of osteosarcoma has been described in a patient treated with teriparatide. At present this seems to equate to the background incidence of osteosarcoma in this population.

PTH use may be limited by its mode of administration; alternative modes of delivery are being investigated. The optimal frequency of administration also remains to be established, and it is possible that PTH might be effective when used intermittently. Cost also may be a limiting factor.

Mode of Action

Exogenously administered PTH appears to have direct actions on osteoblast activity, with biochemical and histomorphometric evidence of de novo bone formation early in response to PTH, before activation of bone resorption. Subsequently, PTH activates bone remodeling but still appears to favor bone formation over bone resorption. PTH stimulates IGF-I and collagen production and appears to increase osteoblast number by stimulating replication, enhancing osteoblast recruitment, and inhibiting apoptosis. Unlike all other treatments, PTH produces a true increase in bone tissue and an apparent restoration of bone microarchitecture (Fig. 354-13).

Fluoride

Fluoride has been available for many years and is a potent stimulator of osteoprogenitor cells when studied in vitro. It has been used in multiple osteoporosis studies with conflicting results, in part because of the use of varying doses and preparations. Despite increments in bone mass of up to 10%, there are no consistent effects of fluoride on vertebral or nonvertebral fracture; the latter may actually increase when high doses of fluoride are used. Fluoride remains an experimental agent despite its long history and multiple studies.

Strontium Ranelate Strontium ranelate is approved in several European countries for the treatment of osteoporosis. It increases bone mass throughout the skeleton; in clinical trials, the drug reduced the risk of vertebral fractures by 37% and that of nonvertebral fractures by 14%. It appears to be modestly antiresorptive while at the same time not causing as much of a decrease in bone formation (measured biochemically). Strontium is incorporated into hydroxyapatite, replacing calcium, a feature that might explain some of its fracture benefits. Small increased risks of venous thrombosis, seizures, and abnormal cognition have been seen and require further study.

Other Potential Anabolic Agents

Several small studies of growth hormone (GH), alone or in combination with other agents, have not shown consistent or substantial positive effects on skeletal mass. Many of these studies have been relatively short term, and the effects of GH, growth hormone每releasing hormone, and the IGFs are still under investigation. Anabolic steroids, mostly derivatives of testosterone, act primarily as antiresorptive agents to reduce bone turnover but also may stimulate osteoblastic activity. Effects on bone mass remain unclear but appear weak in general, and use is limited by masculinizing side effects. Several recent observational studies suggest that the statin drugs, which currently are used to treat hypercholesterolemia, may be associated with increased bone mass and reduced fractures, but conclusions from clinical trials are mixed.

Nonpharmacologic Approaches

Protective pads worn around the outer thigh, which cover the trochanteric region of the hip, can prevent hip fractures in elderly residents in nursing homes. The use of hip protectors is limited largely by issues of compliance and comfort, but new devices are being developed that may circumvent these problems and provide adjunctive treatments.

Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are also useful nonpharmacologic approaches for the treatment of painful vertebral fractures. However, no long-term data are available.

Treatment Monitoring

There are currently no well-accepted guidelines for monitoring treatment of osteoporosis. Because most osteoporosis treatments produce small or moderate bone mass increments on average, it is reasonable to consider BMD as a monitoring tool. Changes must exceed 4% in the spine and 6% in the hip to be considered significant in any individual. The hip is the preferred site due to larger surface area and greater reproducibility. Medication-induced increments may require several years to produce changes of this magnitude (if they do at all). Consequently, it can be argued that BMD should be repeated at intervals >2 years. Only significant BMD reductions should prompt a change in medical regimen, as it is expected that many individuals will not show responses greater than the detection limits of the current measurement techniques.

Biochemical markers of bone turnover may prove useful for treatment monitoring, but little hard evidence currently supports this concept; it remains unclear which endpoint is most useful. If bone turnover markers are used, a determination should be made before therapy is started and repeated ≡4 months after therapy is initiated. In general, a change in bone turnover markers must be 30每40% lower than the baseline to be significant because of the biologic and technical variability in these tests. A positive change in biochemical markers and/or bone density can be useful to help patients adhere to treatment regimens.
 
Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis

Osteoporotic fractures are a well-characterized consequence of the hypercortisolism associated with Cushing's syndrome. However, the therapeutic use of glucocorticoids is by far the most common form of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Glucocorticoids are used widely in the treatment of a variety of disorders, including chronic lung disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, and other connective tissue diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, and after transplantation. Osteoporosis and related fractures are serious side effects of chronic glucocorticoid therapy. Because the effects of glucocorticoids on the skeleton are often superimposed on the consequences of aging and menopause, it is not surprising that women and the elderly are most frequently affected. The skeletal response to steroids is remarkably heterogeneous, however, and even young, growing individuals treated with glucocorticoids can present with fractures.

The risk of fractures depends on the dose and duration of glucocorticoid therapy, although recent data suggest that there may be no completely safe dose. Bone loss is more rapid during the early months of treatment, and trabecular bone is affected more severely than cortical bone. As a result, fractures have been shown to increase within 3 months of steroid treatment. There is an increase in fracture risk in both the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton, including risk of hip fracture. Bone loss can occur with any route of steroid administration, including high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids and intraarticular injections. Alternate-day delivery does not appear to ameliorate the skeletal effects of glucocorticoids.

Pathophysiology

Glucocorticoids increase bone loss by multiple mechanisms, including (1) inhibition of osteoblast function and an increase in osteoblast apoptosis, resulting in impaired synthesis of new bone; (2) stimulation of bone resorption, probably as a secondary effect; (3) impairment of the absorption of calcium across the intestine, probably by a vitamin D每independent effect; (4) increase of urinary calcium loss and perhaps induction of some degree of secondary hyperparathyroidism; (5) reduction of adrenal androgens and suppression of ovarian and testicular secretion of estrogens and androgens; and (6) induction of glucocorticoid myopathy, which may exacerbate effects on skeletal and calcium homeostasis as well as increase the risk of falls.

Evaluation of the Patient

Because of the prevalence of glucocorticoid-induced bone loss, it is important to evaluate the status of the skeleton in all patients starting or already receiving long-term glucocorticoid therapy. Modifiable risk factors should be identified, including those for falls. Examination should include testing of height and muscle strength. Laboratory evaluation should include an assessment of 24-h urinary calcium. All patients on long-term (>3 months) glucocorticoids should have measurement of bone mass at both the spine and the hip using DXA. If only one skeletal site can be measured, it is best to assess the spine in individuals <60 years and the hip in those >60 years.

Prevention

Bone loss caused by glucocorticoids can be prevented, and the risk of fractures significantly reduced. Strategies must include using the lowest dose of glucocorticoid for disease management. Topical and inhaled routes of administration are preferred, where appropriate. Risk factor reduction is important, including smoking cessation, limitation of alcohol consumption, and participation in weight-bearing exercise, when appropriate. All patients should receive an adequate calcium and vitamin D intake from the diet or from supplements.
 
Treatment Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis

Only bisphosphonates have been demonstrated in large clinical trials to reduce the risk of fractures in patients being treated with glucocorticoids. Risedronate prevents bone loss and reduces vertebral fracture risk by 70%. Similar beneficial effects are observed in studies of alendronate. Controlled trials of hormone therapy have shown bone-sparing effects, and calcitonin also has some protective effect in the spine. Thiazides reduce urine calcium loss, but their role in prevention of fractures is unclear. PTH has been studied in a small group of women with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, among whom bone mass increased substantially, and teriparatide is being investigated in a larger multicenter trial.

 Chapter 355. Paget's Disease and Other Dysplasias of Bone >
 

Paget's Disease of Bone

Paget's disease is a localized bone-remodeling disorder that affects widespread, noncontiguous areas of the skeleton. The pathologic process is initiated by overactive osteoclastic bone resorption followed by a compensatory increase in osteoblastic new bone formation, resulting in a structurally disorganized mosaic of woven and lamellar bone. Pagetic bone is expanded, less compact, and more vascular; thus, it is more susceptible to deformities and fractures. Although most patients are asymptomatic, symptoms resulting directly from bony involvement (bone pain, secondary arthritis, fractures) or secondarily from the expansion of bone causing compression of surrounding neural tissue are not uncommon.

Epidemiology

There is a marked geographic variation in the frequency of Paget's disease, with high prevalence in Western Europe (Great Britain, France, and Germany, but not Switzerland or Scandinavia) and among those who have immigrated to Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and North and South America. The disease is rare in native populations of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East; when it does occur, the affected subjects usually have evidence of European ancestry, supporting the migration theory. For unclear reasons, the prevalence and severity of Paget's disease are decreasing, and the age of diagnosis is increasing.

The prevalence is greater in males and increases with age. Autopsy series reveal Paget's disease in about 3% of those over age 40. Prevalence of positive skeletal radiographs in patients over age 55 is 2.5% for men and 1.6% for women. Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels in asymptomatic patients have an age-adjusted incidence of 12.7 and 7 per 100,000 person-years in men and women, respectively.

Etiology

The etiology of Paget's disease of bone remains unknown, but evidence supports both genetic and viral etiologies. A positive family history is found in 15每25% of patients and, when present, raises the prevalence of the disease seven- to tenfold among first-degree relatives.

A clear genetic basis has been established for several rare familial bone disorders that clinically and radiographically resemble Paget's disease but have more severe presentation and earlier onset. A homozygous deletion of the TNFRSF11B gene, which encodes osteoprotegrin (Fig. 355-1), causes juvenile Paget's disease, also known as familial idiopathic hypophosphatasia, a disorder characterized by uncontrolled osteoclastic differentiation and resorption. Familial patterns of disease in several large kindred are consistent with an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance with variable penetrance. Familial expansile osteolysis, expansile skeletal hyperphosphatasia, and early-onset Paget's disease are associated with mutations in TNFRSF11A gene, which encodes RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor-B), a member of the tumor-necrosis factor superfamily critical for osteoclast differentiation (Fig. 355-1). Finally, mutations in the gene for valosin-containing protein cause a rare syndrome with autosomal-dominant inheritance and variable penetrance known as inclusion body myopathy with Paget's disease and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD). The role of genetic factors is less clear in the more common form of late-onset Paget's disease. Although a few families with mutations in the gene encoding RANK have been reported, the most common mutations identified in familial and sporadic cases of Paget's disease have been in the SQSTM1 gene (sequestasome-1 or p62 protein) in the C-terminal ubiquitin-binding domain. The p62 protein is involved in NF每B signaling and regulates osteoclastic differentiation. The phenotypic variability in patients with SQSTM1 mutations suggests that additional factors, such as other genetic influences or viral infection, may influence clinical expression of the disease.

Figure 355-1

 
 
 
Diagram illustrating factors that promote differentiation and function of osteoclasts and osteoblasts and the role of the RANK pathway. Stromal bone marrow (mesenchymal) cells and differentiated osteoblasts produce multiple growth factors and cytokines, including macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), to modulate osteoclastogenesis. RANKL (receptor activator of NFB ligand) is produced by osteoblast progenitors and mature osteoblasts and can bind to a soluble decoy receptor known as OPG (osteoprotegerin) to inhibit RANKL action. Alternatively, a cell-cell interaction between osteoblast and osteoclast progenitors allows RANKL to bind to its membrane-bound receptor, RANK, thereby stimulating osteoclast differentiation and function. RANK binds intracellular proteins called TRAFs (tumor necrosis factor receptor每associated factors) that mediate receptor signaling through transcription factors such as NFB. M-CSF binds to its receptor, c-fms, which is the cellular homologue of the fms oncogene. See text for the potential role of these pathways in disorders of osteoclast function such as Paget's disease and osteopetrosis.
 
 

Several lines of evidence suggest that a viral infection may contribute to the clinical manifestations of Paget disease, including (1) the presence of cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions resembling paramyxoviruses (measles and respiratory syncytial virus) in pagetic osteoclasts and (2) viral mRNA in precursor and mature osteoclasts. The viral etiology is further supported by conversion of osteoclast precursors to pagetic-like osteoclasts by vectors containing the measles virus nucleocapsid or matrix genes. However, the viral etiology has been questioned by the inability to culture a live virus from pagetic bone and by failure to clone the full-length viral genes from material obtained from patients with Paget's disease.

Pathophysiology

The principal abnormality in Paget's disease is the increased number and activity of osteoclasts. Pagetic osteoclasts are large, increased 10- to 100-fold in number and have a greater number of nuclei (as many as 100 compared to 3每5 nuclei in the normal osteoclast). The overactive osteoclasts may create a sevenfold increase in resorptive surfaces and an erosion rate of 9 米g/day (normal is 1 米g/day). Several causes for the increased number and activity of pagetic osteoclasts have been identified: (1) osteoclastic precursors are hypersensitive to 1,25(OH)2D3; (2) osteoclasts are hyperresponsive to RANK ligand (RANKL), the osteoclast stimulatory factor that mediates the effects of most osteotropic factors on osteoclast formation; (3) marrow stromal cells from pagetic lesions have increased RANKL expression; (4) osteoclast precursor recruitment is increased by interleukin (IL) 6, which is increased in the blood of patients with active Paget disease and is overexpressed in pagetic osteoclasts; (5) expression of the proto-oncogene c-fos, which increases osteoclastic activity, is increased; and (6) the antiapoptotic oncogene Bcl-2 in pagetic bone is overexpressed. Numerous osteoblasts are recruited to active resorption sites and produce large amounts of new bone matrix. As a result, bone turnover is high, and bone mass is normal or increased, not reduced, unless there is concomitant deficiency of calcium and/or vitamin D.

The characteristic feature of Paget's disease is increased bone resorption accompanied by accelerated bone formation. An initial osteolytic phase involves prominent bone resorption and marked hypervascularization. Radiographically, this manifests as an advancing lytic wedge, or "blade of grass" lesion. The second phase is a period of very active bone formation and resorption that replaces normal lamellar bone with haphazard (woven) bone. Fibrous connective tissue may replace normal bone marrow. In the final sclerotic phase, bone resorption declines progressively and leads to a hard, dense, less vascular pagetic or mosaic bone, which represents the so-called burned-out phase of Paget's disease. All three phases may be present at the same time at different skeletal sites.

Clinical Manifestations

Diagnosis is often made in asymptomatic patients because they have elevated ALP levels on routine blood chemistry testing or an abnormality on a skeletal radiograph obtained for another indication. The skeletal sites most commonly involved are the pelvis, vertebral bodies, skull, femur, and tibia. Familial cases with an early presentation often have numerous active sites of skeletal involvement.

The most common presenting symptom is pain, which may result from increased bony vascularity, expanding lytic lesions, fractures, bowing, or other deformities. Bowing of the femur or tibia causes gait abnormalities and abnormal mechanical stresses with secondary osteoarthritis of the hip or knee joints. Long bone bowing also causes extremity pain by stretching the muscles attached to the bone softened by the pagetic process. Back pain results from enlarged pagetic vertebrae, vertebral compression fractures, spinal stenosis, degenerative changes of the joints, and altered body mechanics with kyphosis and forward tilt of the upper back. Rarely, spinal cord compression may result from bone enlargement or from the vascular steal syndrome. Skull involvement may cause headaches, symmetric or asymmetric enlargement of the parietal or frontal bones (frontal bossing), and increased head size. Cranial expansion may narrow cranial foramens and cause neurologic complications including hearing loss from cochlear nerve damage from temporal bone involvement, cranial nerve palsies, and softening of the base of the skull (platybasia) with the risk of brainstem compression. Pagetic involvement of the facial bones may cause facial deformity; loss of teeth and other dental conditions; and, rarely, airway compression.

Fractures are serious complications of Paget's disease and usually occur in long bones at areas of active or advancing lytic lesions. Common fracture sites are the femoral shaft and subtrochanteric regions. Neoplasms arising from pagetic bone are rare. The incidence of sarcoma appears to be decreasing, possibly because of earlier, more effective treatment with potent antiresorptive agents. The majority of tumors are osteosarcomas, which usually present with new pain in a long-standing pagetic lesion. Osteoclast-rich benign giant cell tumors may arise in areas adjacent to pagetic bone, and they respond to glucocorticoid therapy.

Cardiovascular complications may occur in patients with involvement of large (15每35%) portions of the skeleton and a high degree of disease activity (ALP four times above normal). The extensive arteriovenous shunting and marked increases in blood flow through the vascular pagetic bone lead to a high-output state and cardiac enlargement. However, high-output heart failure is relatively rare and usually develops in patients with concomitant cardiac pathology. In addition, calcific aortic stenosis and diffuse vascular calcifications have been associated with Paget's disease.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis may be suggested on clinical examination by the presence of an enlarged skull with frontal bossing, bowing of an extremity, or short stature with simian posturing. An extremity with an area of warmth and tenderness to palpation may suggest an underlying pagetic lesion. Other findings include bony deformity of the pelvis, skull, spine, and extremities; arthritic involvement of the joints adjacent to lesions; and leg-length discrepancy resulting from deformities of the long bones.

Paget's disease is usually diagnosed from radiologic and biochemical abnormalities. Radiographic findings typical of Paget's disease include enlargement or expansion of an entire bone or area of a long bone, cortical thickening, coarsening of trabecular markings, and typical lytic and sclerotic changes. Skull radiographs (Fig. 355-2) reveal regions of "cotton wool," or osteoporosis circumscripta, thickening of diploic areas, and enlargement and sclerosis of a portion or all of one or more skull bones. Vertebral cortical thickening of the superior and inferior end plates creates a "picture frame" vertebra. Diffuse radiodense enlargement of a vertebra is referred to as "ivory vertebra." Pelvic radiographs may demonstrate disruption or fusion of the sacroiliac joints; porotic and radiodense lesions of the ilium with whorls of coarse trabeculation; thickened and sclerotic iliopectineal line (brim sign); and softening with protrusio acetabuli, with axial migration of the hips and functional flexion contracture. Radiographs of long bones reveal bowing deformity and typical pagetic changes of cortical thickening and expansion and areas of lucency and sclerosis (Fig. 355-3). Radionuclide 99mTc bone scans are less specific but are more sensitive than standard radiographs for identifying sites of active skeletal lesions. Although CT and MRI studies are not necessary in most cases, CT may be useful for the assessment of possible fracture and MRI is necessary to assess the possibility of sarcoma, giant cell tumor, or metastatic disease in pagetic bone. Definitive diagnosis of malignancy often requires bone biopsy.

Biochemical evaluation is useful in the diagnosis and management of Paget disease. The marked increase in bone turnover can be monitored using biochemical markers of bone formation and resorption. The parallel rise in markers of bone formation and resorption confirms the coupling of bone formation and resorption in Paget's disease. The degree of bone-marker elevation reflects the extent and severity of the disease. Patients with the highest elevation of ALP (10 times the upper limit of normal) typically have involvement of the skull and at least one other skeletal site. Lower values suggest less extensive involvement or a quiescent phase of the disease. For most patients, serum total ALP remains the test of choice both for diagnosis and assessing response to therapy. Occasionally, a symptomatic patient with evidence of progression at a single site may have a normal total ALP level but increased bone-specific ALP. For unclear reasons, serum osteocalcin, another marker of bone formation, is not always elevated and is not recommended for use in diagnosis or management of Paget's disease. Bone-resorption markers (serum or urine N-telopeptide or C-telopeptide measured in the blood or urine) are also elevated in active Paget's disease and decrease more rapidly in response to therapy than does ALP.

Serum calcium and phosphate levels are normal in Paget's disease. Immobilization of a patient with active Paget's disease may rarely cause hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria and increase the risk for nephrolithiasis. However, the discovery of hypercalcemia, even in the presence of immobilization, should prompt a search for another cause of hypercalcemia. In contrast, hypocalcemia or mild secondary hyperparathyroidism may develop in Paget patients with very active bone formation and insufficient dietary calcium intake, particularly during bisphosphonate therapy when bone resorption is rapidly suppressed and active bone formation continues. Therefore, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake should be instituted prior to administration of bisphosphonates.
 
Treatment: Paget's Disease of Bone

The development of effective and potent pharmacologic agents (Table 355-1) has changed the treatment philosophy from treating only symptomatic patients to treating asymptomatic patients who are at risk for complications. Pharmacologic therapy is indicated in the following circumstances: to control symptoms caused by metabolically active Paget's disease such as bone pain, fracture, headache, pain from pagetic radiculopathy or arthropathy, or neurologic complications; to decrease local blood flow and minimize operative blood loss in patients who need surgery at an active pagetic site; to reduce hypercalciuria that may occur during immobilization; and to decrease the risk of complications when disease activity is high (elevated ALP) and when the site of involvement involves weight-bearing bones, areas adjacent to major joints, vertebral bodies, and the skull. Whether or not early therapy prevents late complications remains to be determined. A recent randomized study of over 1200 patients from the UK showed no difference in bone pain, fracture rates, quality of life, and hearing loss between patients who received pharmacologic therapy to control symptoms (bone pain) and those receiving bisphosphonates to normalize serum ALP. However, the most potent agent (zoledronic acid) was not used and the duration of observation (mean of 3 years with a range of 2 to 5 years) may not be long enough to assess the impact of treatment on long-term outcomes. It seems likely that the restoration of normal bone architecture following suppression of pagetic activity will prevent further deformities and complications.

Table 355-1 Pharmacologic Agents Approved for Treatment of Paget's Disease

 
 
Name (Brand) Dose and Mode of Delivery Normalization of ALP 
Zoledronate (Zometa) 5 mg IV over 15 min 90% of patients at 6 mo 
Pamidronate (Aredia) 30 mg IV/d over 4 h on 3 days 50% of patients 
Risedronate (Actonel) 30 mg PO/d for 2 mo 73% of patients 
Alendronate (Fosamax) 40 mg PO/d for 6 mo 63% of patients 
Tiludronate (Skelid) 800 mg PO daily for 3 mo 35% of patients 
Etidronate (Didronel) 200每400 mg PO/d x 6 mo 15% of patients 
Calcitonin (Miacalcin) 100 U SC daily for 6每18 mo (may reduce to 50 U 3 times per wk) (Reduction of ALP by to 50%) 
 

 

Agents approved for treatment of Paget's disease suppress the very high rates of bone resorption and secondarily decrease the high rates of bone formation (Table 355-1). As a result of decreasing bone turnover, pagetic structural patterns, including areas of poorly mineralized woven bone, are replaced by more normal cancellous or lamellar bone. Reduced bone turnover can be documented by a decline in serum ALP and urine or serum resorption markers (N-telopeptide, C-telopeptide).

The first clinically useful agent, etidronate, is now rarely used because the doses required to suppress bone resorption may impair mineralization, necessitating that the drug be given for a maximum of 6 months followed by a 6-month drug-free period. The second-generation oral bisphosphonates〞tiludronate, alendronate, and risedronate〞are more potent than etidronate in controlling bone turnover and, thus, induce a longer remission at a lower dose. The lower doses reduce the risks of impaired mineralization and osteomalacia. Oral bisphosphonates should be taken first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, followed by maintenance of upright posture with no food, drink, or other medications for 30每60 minutes. The efficacy of different agents, based on their ability to normalize or decrease ALP levels, is summarized in Table 355-1, although the response rates are not comparable because they are obtained from different studies.

Intravenous bisphosphonates approved for Paget's disease include pamidronate and zoledronic acid. Although the recommended dose for pamidronate is 30 mg dissolved in 500 mL of normal saline or dextrose IV over 4 h on three consecutive days, a more commonly used simpler regimen is a single infusion of 60每90 mg in patients with mild elevation of serum ALP and multiple 90-mg infusions in those with higher levels of ALP. In many patients, particularly those who have severe disease or need rapid normalization of bone turnover (neurologic symptoms, severe bone pain due to a lytic lesion, risk of an impending fracture, or pretreatment prior to elective surgery in an area of active disease), treatment with zoledronic acid is the first choice. It normalizes ALP in about 90% of patients by 6 months, and the therapeutic effect persists for at least 6 more months in most patients. About 10每20% of patients experience a flulike syndrome after the first infusion, which can be partly ameliorated by pretreatment with acetaminophen or NSAIDs. In patients with high bone turnover, vitamin D (400每800 IU daily) and calcium (500 mg three times daily) should be provided to prevent hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Remission following treatment with IV bisphosphonates, particularly zoledronic acid, may persist for well over 1 year. Bisphosphonates should not be used in patients with renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate <35ml/min).

The subcutaneous injectable form of salmon calcitonin is approved for the treatment of Paget's disease. Intranasal calcitonin spray is approved for osteoporosis at a dose of 200 U/d; however, the efficacy of this dose in Paget's disease has not been thoroughly studied. The usual starting dose of injectable calcitonin (100 U/d) reduces ALP by 50% and may relieve skeletal symptoms. The dose may be reduced to 50 U/d three times weekly after an initial favorable response to 100 U daily; however, the lower dose may require long-term use to sustain efficacy. The common side effects of calcitonin therapy are nausea and facial flushing. Secondary resistance after prolonged use may be due to either the formation of anticalcitonin antibodies or downregulation of osteoclastic cell每surface calcitonin receptors. The lower potency and injectable mode of delivery make this agent a less-attractive treatment option that should be reserved for patients who either do not tolerate bisphosphonates or have a contraindication to their use.
 
Sclerosing Bone Disorders

Osteopetrosis

Osteopetrosis refers to a group of disorders caused by severe impairment of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Other terms that are often used include marble bone disease, which captures the solid x-ray appearance of the involved skeleton, and Albers-Schonberg disease, which refers to the milder, adult form of osteopetrosis also known as autosomal-dominant osteopetrosis type II. The major types of osteopetrosis include malignant (severe, infantile, autosomal recessive) osteopetrosis and benign (adult, autosomal dominant) osteopetrosis types I and II. A rare autosomal recessive intermediate form has a more benign prognosis. Autosomal recessive carbonic anhydrase (CA) II deficiency produces osteopetrosis of intermediate severity associated with renal tubular acidosis and cerebral calcification.

Etiology and Genetics

Naturally occurring and gene-knockout animal models with phenotypes similar to those of the human disorders have been used to explore the genetic basis of osteopetrosis. The primary defect in osteopetrosis is the loss of osteoclastic bone resorption and preservation of normal osteoblastic bone formation. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a soluble decoy receptor that binds osteoblast-derived RANK ligand, which mediates osteoclast differentiation and activation (Fig. 355-1). Transgenic mice that overexpress OPG develop osteopetrosis, presumably by blocking RANK ligand. Mice deficient in RANK lack osteoclasts and develop severe osteopetrosis.

Recessive mutations of CA II prevent osteoclasts from generating an acid environment in the clear zone between its ruffled border and the adjacent mineral surface. Absence of CA II, therefore, impairs osteoclastic bone resorption. Other forms of human disease have less clear genetic defects. About one-half of the patients with malignant infantile osteopetrosis have a mutation in the TCIRG1 gene encoding the osteoclast-specific subunit of the vacuolar proton pump, which mediates the acidification of the interface between bone mineral and the osteoclast ruffled border. Mutations in the CICN7 chloride channel gene cause autosomal-dominant osteopetrosis type II.

Clinical Presentation

The incidence of autosomal-recessive severe (malignant) osteopetrosis ranges from 1 in 200,000 to 1 in 500,000 live births. As bone and cartilage fail to undergo modeling, paralysis of one or more cranial nerves may occur due to narrowing of the cranial foramens. Failure of skeletal modeling also results in inadequate marrow space, leading to extramedullary hematopoiesis with hypersplenism and pancytopenia. Hypocalcemia due to lack of osteoclastic bone resorption may occur in infants and young children. The untreated infantile disease is fatal, often before age five.

Adult (benign) osteopetrosis is an autosomal-dominant disease that is usually diagnosed by the discovery of typical skeletal changes in young adults who undergo radiologic evaluation of a fracture. The prevalence is 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 500,000 adults. The course is not always benign, because fractures may be accompanied by loss of vision, deafness, psychomotor delay, mandibular osteomyelitis, and other complications usually associated with the juvenile form. In some kindred, nonpenetrance results in skip generations, while in other families, severely affected children are born into families with benign disease. The milder form of the disease does not usually require treatment.

Radiography

Typically, there are generalized symmetric increases in bone mass with thickening of both cortical and trabecular bone. Diaphyses and metaphyses are broadened, and alternating sclerotic and lucent bands may be seen in the iliac crests, at the ends of long bones, and in vertebral bodies. The cranium is usually thickened, particularly at the base of the skull, and the paranasal and mastoid sinuses are underpneumatized.

Laboratory Findings

The only significant laboratory findings are elevated serum levels of osteoclast-derived tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and the brain isoenzyme of creatine kinase. Serum calcium may be low in severe disease, and parathyroid hormone and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels may be elevated in response to hypocalcemia.

Treatment: Osteopetrosis

Allogeneic HLA-identical bone marrow transplantation has been successful in some children. Following transplantation, the marrow contains progenitor cells and normally functioning osteoclasts. A cure is most likely when children are transplanted before age four. Marrow transplantation from nonidentical HLA-matched donors has a much higher failure rate. Limited studies in small numbers of patients have suggested variable benefits following treatment with interferon 污-1汕, 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D (which stimulates osteoclasts directly), methylprednisolone, and a low-calcium/high-phosphate diet.

Surgical intervention is indicated to decompress optic or auditory nerve compression. Orthopedic management is required for the surgical treatment of fractures and their complications including malunion and postfracture deformity.

Pyknodysostosis

This is an autosomal-recessive form of osteosclerosis that is believed to have affected the French impressionist painter Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. The molecular basis involves mutations in the gene that encodes cathepsin K, a lysosomal metalloproteinase highly expressed in osteoclasts and important for bone-matrix degradation. Osteoclasts are present but do not function normally. Pyknodysostosis is a form of short-limb dwarfism that presents with frequent fractures but usually a normal life span. Clinical features include short stature; kyphoscoliosis and deformities of the chest; high arched palate; proptosis; blue sclerae; dysmorphic features including small face and chin, frontooccipital prominence, pointed beaked nose, large cranium, and obtuse mandibular angle; and small, square hands with hypoplastic nails. Radiographs demonstrate a generalized increase in bone density, but in contrast to osteopetrosis, the long bones are normally shaped. Separated cranial sutures, including the persistent patency of the anterior fontanel, are characteristic of the disorder. There may also be hypoplasia of the sinuses, mandible, distal clavicles, and terminal phalanges. Persistence of deciduous teeth and sclerosis of the calvarium and base of the skull are also common. Histologic evaluation shows normal cortical bone architecture with decreased osteoblastic and osteoclastic activities. Serum chemistries are normal, and, unlike osteopetrosis, there is no anemia. There is no known treatment for this condition, and there are no reports of attempted bone marrow transplant.

Progressive Diaphyseal Dysplasia

Also known as Camurati-Engelmann disease, progressive diaphyseal dysplasia is an autosomal-dominant disorder that is characterized radiographically by diaphyseal hyperostosis and a symmetric thickening and increased diameter of the endosteal and periosteal surfaces of the diaphyses of the long bones, particularly the femur and tibia, and, less often, the fibula, radius, and ulna. The genetic defect responsible for the disease has been localized to the area of chromosome 19q13.2 encoding tumor growth factor (TGF)-汕1. The mutation promotes activation of TGF-汕1. The clinical severity is variable. The most common presenting symptoms are pain and tenderness of the involved areas, fatigue, muscle wasting, and gait disturbance. The weakness may be mistaken for muscular dystrophy. Characteristic body habitus includes thin limbs with little muscle mass yet prominent and palpable bones and, when the skull is involved, large head with prominent forehead and proptosis. Patients may also display signs of cranial nerve palsies, hydrocephalus, central hypogonadism, and Raynaud's phenomenon. Radiographically, patchy progressive endosteal and periosteal new bone formation is observed along the diaphyses of the long bones. Bone scintigraphy shows increased radiotracer uptake in involved areas.

Treatment with low-dose glucocorticoids relieves bone pain and may reverse the abnormal bone formation. Intermittent bisphosphonate therapy has produced clinical improvement in a limited number of patients.

Hyperostosis Corticalis Generalisata

This is also known as van Buchem's disease; it is an autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by endosteal hyperostosis in which osteosclerosis involves the skull, mandible, clavicles, and ribs. The major manifestations are due to narrowed cranial foramens with neural compressions that may result in optic atrophy, facial paralysis, and deafness. Adults may have an enlarged mandible. Serum ALP levels may be elevated, which reflect the uncoupled bone remodeling with high osteoblastic formation rates and low osteoclastic resorption. As a result, there is increased accumulation of normal bone. Endosteal hyperostosis with syndactyly, known as sclerosteosis, is a more severe form. The genetic defects for both sclerosteosis and van Buchem's disease have been assigned to the same region of the chromosome 17q12-q21. It is possible that both conditions may have deactivating mutations in the BEER (bone-expressed equilibrium regulator) gene.

Melorheostosis

Melorheostosis (Greek, "flowing hyperostosis") may occur sporadically or follow a pattern consistent with an autosomal-recessive disorder. The major manifestation is progressive linear hyperostosis in one or more bones of one limb, usually a lower extremity. The name comes from the radiographic appearance of the involved bone, which resembles melted wax that has dripped down a candle. Symptoms appear during childhood as pain or stiffness in the area of sclerotic bone. There may be associated ectopic soft tissue masses, composed of cartilage or osseous tissue, and skin changes overlying the involved bone, consisting of scleroderma-like areas and hypertrichosis. The disease does not progress in adults, but pain and stiffness may persist. Laboratory tests are unremarkable. No specific etiology is known. There is no specific treatment. Surgical interventions to correct contractures are often unsuccessful.

Osteopoikilosis

The literal translation of osteopoikilosis is "spotted bones"; it is a benign autosomal-dominant condition in which numerous small, variably shaped (usually round or oval) foci of bony sclerosis are seen in the epiphyses and adjacent metaphyses. The lesions may involve any bone except the skull, ribs, and vertebrae. They may be misidentified as metastatic lesions. The main differentiating points are that bony lesions of osteopoikilosis are stable over time and do not accumulate radionucleotide on bone scanning. In some kindred, osteopoikilosis is associated with connective tissue nevi known as dermatofibrosis lenticularis disseminata, also known as Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome. Histologic inspection reveals thickened but otherwise normal trabeculae and islands of normal cortical bone. No treatment is indicated.

Hepatitis C每Associated Osteosclerosis

Hepatitis C每associated osteosclerosis (HCAO) is a rare acquired diffuse osteosclerosis in adults with prior hepatitis C infection. After a latent period of several years, patients develop diffuse appendicular bone pain and a generalized increase in bone mass with elevated serum ALP. Bone biopsy and histomorphometry reveal increased rates of bone formation, decreased bone resorption with a marked decrease in osteoclasts, and dense lamellar bone. One patient had increased serum OPG levels, and bone biopsy showed large numbers of osteoblasts positive for OPG and reduced osteoclast number. Empirical therapy includes pain control, and there may be beneficial response to either calcitonin or bisphosphonate.
 
Disorders Associated with Defective Mineralization

Hypophosphatasia

This is a rare inherited disorder that presents as rickets in infants and children or osteomalacia in adults with paradoxically low serum levels of ALP. The frequency of the severe neonatal and infantile forms is about 1 in 100,000 live births in Canada, where the disease is most common because of its high prevalence among Mennonites and Hutterites. It is rare in African Americans. The severity of the disease is remarkably variable, ranging from intrauterine death associated with profound skeletal hypomineralization at one extreme to premature tooth loss as the only manifestation in some adults. Severe cases are inherited in an autosomal-recessive manner, but the genetic patterns are less clear for the milder forms. The disease is caused by a deficiency of tissue nonspecific (bone/liver/kidney) ALP (TNSALP), which, although ubiquitous, results only in bone abnormalities. Protein levels and functions of the other ALP isozymes (germ cell, intestinal, placental) are normal. Defective ALP permits accumulation of its major naturally occurring substrates including phosphoethanolamine (PEA), inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), and pyridoxal 5∩-phosphate (PLP). The accumulation of PPi interferes with mineralization through its action as a potent inhibitor of hydroxyapatite crystal growth.

Perinatal hypophosphatasia becomes manifest during pregnancy and is often complicated by polyhydramnios and intrauterine death. The infantile form becomes clinically apparent before the age of 6 months with failure to thrive, rachitic deformities, functional craniosynostosis despite widely open fontanels (which are actually hypomineralized areas of the calvarium), raised intracranial pressure, and flail chest and predisposition to pneumonia. Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria are common. This form has a mortality rate of about 50%. Prognosis seems to improve for the children who survive infancy. Childhood hypophosphatasia has variable clinical presentation. Premature loss of deciduous teeth (before age five) is the hallmark of the disease. Rickets causes delayed walking with waddling gait, short stature, and dolichocephalic skull with frontal bossing. The disease often improves during puberty but may recur in adult life. Adult hypophosphatasia presents during middle age with painful, poorly healing metatarsal stress fractures or thigh pain due to femoral pseudofractures.

Laboratory investigation reveals low ALP levels and normal or elevated levels of serum calcium and phosphorus despite clinical and radiologic evidence of rickets or osteomalacia. Serum parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels are normal. The elevation of PLP is specific for the disease and may even be present in asymptomatic parents of severely affected children. Because vitamin B6 increases PLP levels, vitamin B6 supplements should be discontinued one week before testing.

There is no established medical therapy. In contrast to other forms of rickets and osteomalacia, calcium and vitamin D supplementation should be avoided because they may aggravate hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. A low-calcium diet, glucocorticoids, and calcitonin have been used in a small number of patients with variable responses. Because fracture healing is poor, placement of intramedullary rods is best for acute fracture repair and for prophylactic prevention of fractures.

Axial Osteomalacia

This is a rare disorder characterized by defective skeletal mineralization despite normal serum calcium and phosphate levels. Clinically, the disorder presents in middle-aged or elderly men with chronic axial skeletal discomfort. Cervical spine pain may also be present. Radiographic findings are mainly osteosclerosis due to coarsened trabecular patterns typical of osteomalacia. Spine, pelvis, and ribs are most commonly affected. Histologic changes show defective mineralization and flat, inactive osteoblasts. The primary defect appears to be an acquired defect in osteoblast function. The course is benign, and there is no established treatment. Calcium and vitamin D therapies are not effective.

Fibrogenesis Imperfecta Ossium

This is a rare condition of unknown etiology. It presents in both sexes; in middle age or later; with progressive, intractable skeletal pain and fractures; worsening immobilization; and a debilitating course. Radiographic evaluation reveals generalized osteomalacia, osteopenia, and occasional pseudofractures. Histologic features include a tangled pattern of collagen fibrils with abundant osteoblasts and osteoclasts. There is no effective treatment. Spontaneous remission has been reported in a small number of patients. Calcium and vitamin D have not been beneficial.
 
Fibrous Dysplasia and MCCune-Albright Syndrome

Fibrous dysplasia is a sporadic disorder characterized by the presence of one (monostotic) or more (polyostotic) expanding fibrous skeletal lesions composed of bone-forming mesenchyme. The association of the polyostotic form with caf谷-au-lait spots and hyperfunction of an endocrine system such as pseudo-precocious puberty of ovarian origin is known as McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS). A spectrum of the phenotypes is caused by activating mutations in the GNAS1 gene, which encodes the 汐 subunit of the stimulatory G protein (Gs汐). As the postzygotic mutations occur at different stages of early development, the extent and type of tissue affected are variable and explain the mosaic pattern of skin and bone changes. GTP binding activates the Gs汐 regulatory protein and mutations in regions of Gs汐 that selectively inhibit GTPase activity, which results in constitutive stimulation of the cyclic AMP每protein kinase A signal transduction pathway. Such mutations of the Gs汐 protein每coupled receptor may cause autonomous function in bone (parathyroid hormone receptor); skin (melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor); and various endocrine glands including ovary (follicle-stimulating hormone receptor), thyroid (thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor), adrenal (adrenocorticotropic hormone receptor), and pituitary (growth hormone每releasing hormone receptor). The skeletal lesions are composed largely of mesenchymal cells that do not differentiate into osteoblasts, resulting in the formation of imperfect bone. In some areas of bone, fibroblast-like cells develop features of osteoblasts in that they produce extracellular matrix that organizes into woven bone. Calcification may occur in some areas. In other areas, cells have features of chondrocytes and produce cartilage-like extracellular matrix.

Clinical Presentation

Fibrous dysplasia occurs with equal frequency in both sexes, whereas MAS with precocious puberty is more common (10:1) in girls. The monostotic form is the most common and is usually diagnosed in patients between 20 and 30 years of age without associated skin lesions. The polyostotic form typically manifests in children <10 years old and may progress with age. Early-onset disease is generally more severe. Lesions may become quiescent in puberty and progress during pregnancy or with estrogen therapy. In polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, the lesions most commonly involve the maxilla and other craniofacial bones, ribs, and metaphyseal or diaphyseal portions of the proximal femur or tibia. Expanding bone lesions may cause pain, deformity, fractures, and nerve entrapment. Sarcomatous degeneration involving the facial bones or femur is infrequent (<1%). The risk of malignant transformation is increased by radiation, which has proven to be ineffective treatment. In rare patients with widespread lesions, renal phosphate wasting and hypophosphatemia may cause rickets or osteomalacia. Hypophosphatemia may be due to production of a phosphaturic factor by the abnormal fibrous tissue.

MAS patients may have caf谷-au-lait spots, which are flat, hyperpigmented skin lesions that have rough borders ("coast of Maine") in contrast to the caf谷-au-lait lesions of neurofibromatosis that have smooth borders ("coast of California"). The most common endocrinopathy is isosexual pseudoprecocious puberty in girls. Other less common endocrine disorders include thyrotoxicosis, Cushing's syndrome, acromegaly, hyperparathyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, and pseudoprecocious puberty in boys.

Radiographic Findings

In long bones, the fibrous dysplastic lesions are typically well-defined, radiolucent areas with thin cortices and a ground-glass appearance. Lesions may be lobulated with trabeculated areas of radiolucency (Fig. 355-4). Involvement of facial bones usually presents as radiodense lesions, which may create a leonine appearance (leontiasis osea). Expansile cranial lesions may narrow foramens and cause optic lesions, reduce hearing, and create other manifestations of cranial nerve compression.

Laboratory Results

Serum ALP is occasionally elevated but calcium, parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels are normal. Patients with extensive polyostotic lesions may have hypophosphatemia, hyperphosphaturia, and osteomalacia. The hypophosphatemia and phosphaturia are directly related to the levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). Biochemical markers of bone turnover may be elevated.

Treatment: Fibrous Dysplasia and Mccune-Albright Syndrome

Spontaneous healing of the lesions does not occur, and there is no established effective treatment. Improvement in bone pain and partial or complete resolution of radiographic lesions have been reported after IV bisphosphonate therapy. Surgical stabilization is used to prevent pathologic fracture or destruction of a major joint space and to relieve nerve root or cranial nerve compression or sinus obstruction.
 
Other Dysplasias of Bone and Cartilage

Pachydermoperiostosis

Pachydermoperiostosis, or hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (primary or idiopathic), is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by periosteal new bone formation that involves the distal extremities. The lesions present as clubbing of the digits and hyperhydrosis and thickening of the skin, primarily of the face and forehead. The changes usually appear during adolescence, progress over the next decade, and then become quiescent. During the active phase, progressive enlargement of the hands and feet produces a pawlike appearance, which may be mistaken for acromegaly. Arthralgias, pseudogout, and limited mobility may also occur. The disorder must be differentiated from secondary hypertrophic osteopathy that develops during the course of serious pulmonary disorders. The two conditions can be differentiated by standard radiography of the digits in which secondary pachydermoperiostosis has exuberant periosteal new bone formation and a smooth and undulating surface. In contrast, primary hypertrophic osteopathy has an irregular periosteal surface.

There are no diagnostic blood or urine tests. Synovial fluid does not have an inflammatory profile. There is no specific therapy, although a limited experience with colchicine suggests some benefit in controlling the arthralgias.

Osteochondrodysplasias

These include several hundred heritable disorders of connective tissue. These primary abnormalities of cartilage manifest as disturbances in cartilage and bone growth. Selected growth-plate chondrodysplasias are described here. For discussion of chondrodysplasias, see Chap. 363.

Achondrodysplasia

This is a relatively common form of short-limb dwarfism that occurs in 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 40,000 live births. The disease is caused by a mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene that results in a gain-of-function state. Most cases are sporadic mutations. However, when the disorder appears in families, the inheritance pattern is consistent with an autosomal-dominant disorder. The primary defect is abnormal chondrocyte proliferation at the growth plate that causes development of short, but proportionately thick, long bones. Other regions of the long bones may be relatively unaffected. The disorder is manifest by the presence of short limbs (particularly the proximal portions), normal trunk, large head, saddle nose, and an exaggerated lumbar lordosis. Severe spinal deformity may lead to cord compression. The homozygous disorder is more serious than the sporadic form and may cause neonatal death. Pseudoachondroplasia clinically resembles achondrodysplasia but has no skull abnormalities.

Enchondromatosis

This is also called dyschondroplasia or Ollier's disease; it is also a disorder of the growth plate in which the primary cartilage is not resorbed. Cartilage ossification proceeds normally, but it is not resorbed normally, leading to cartilage accumulation. The changes are most marked at the ends of long bones, where the highest growth rates occur. Chondrosarcoma develops infrequently. The association of enchondromatosis and cavernous hemangiomas of the skin and soft tissues is known as Maffucci syndrome. Both Ollier's disease and Maffucci syndrome are associated with various malignancies, including granulosa cell tumor of the ovary and cerebral glioma.

Multiple Exostoses

This is also called diaphyseal aclasis or osteochondromatosis; it is a genetic disorder that follows an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance. In this condition, areas of growth plates become displaced, presumably by growing through a defect in the perichondrium. The lesion begins with vascular invasion of the growth-plate cartilage, resulting in a characteristic radiographic finding of a mass that is in direct communication with the marrow cavity of the parent bone. The underlying cortex is resorbed. The disease is caused by inactivating mutations of the EXT1 and EXT2 genes, whose products normally regulate processing of chondrocyte cytoskeletal proteins. The products of the EXT gene likely function as tumor suppressors, with the loss-of-function mutation resulting in abnormal proliferation of growth-plate cartilage. Solitary or multiple lesions are located in the metaphyses of long bones. Although usually asymptomatic, the lesions may interfere with joint or tendon function or compress peripheral nerves. The lesions stop growing when growth ceases but may recur during pregnancy. There is a small risk for malignant transformation into chondrosarcoma.
 
Extraskeletal (Ectopic) Calcification and Ossification

Deposition of calcium phosphate crystals (calcification) or formation of true bone (ossification) in nonosseous soft tissue may occur by one of three mechanisms: (1) metastatic calcification due to a supranormal calcium &multi; phosphate concentration product in extracellular fluid; (2) dystrophic calcification due to mineral deposition into metabolically impaired or dead tissue despite normal serum levels of calcium and phosphate; and (3) ectopic ossification, or true bone formation. Disorders that may cause extraskeletal calcification or ossification are listed in Table 355-2.

Metastatic Calcification

Soft tissue calcification may complicate diseases associated with significant hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, or both. In addition, vitamin D and phosphate treatments or calcium administration in the presence of mild hyperphosphatemia, such as during hemodialysis, may induce ectopic calcification. Calcium phosphate precipitation may complicate any disorder when the serum calcium &multi; phosphate concentration product is >75. The initial calcium phosphate deposition is in the form of small, poorly organized crystals, which subsequently organize into hydroxyapatite crystals. Calcifications that occur in hypercalcemic states with normal or low phosphate have a predilection for kidney, lungs, and gastric mucosa. Hyperphosphatemia with normal or low serum calcium may promote soft tissue calcification with predilection for the kidney and arteries. The disturbances of calcium and phosphate in renal failure and hemodialysis are common causes of soft tissue (metastatic) calcification.

Tumoral Calcinosis

This is a rare genetic disorder characterized by masses of metastatic calcifications in soft tissues around major joints, most often shoulders, hips, and ankles. Tumoral calcinosis differs from other disorders in that the periarticular masses contain hydroxyapatite crystals or amorphous calcium phosphate complexes, while in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (below), true bone is formed in soft tissues. About one-third of tumoral calcinosis cases are familial, with both autosomal-recessive and autosomal-dominant modes of inheritance reported. The disease is also associated with a variably expressed abnormality of dentition marked by short bulbous roots, pulp calcification, and radicular dentin deposited in swirls. The primary defect responsible for the metastatic calcification appears to be hyperphosphatemia resulting from the increased capacity of the renal tubule to reabsorb filtered phosphate. Spontaneous soft tissue calcification is related to the elevated serum phosphate, which, along with normal serum calcium, exceeds the concentration product of 75.

All of the North American patients reported have been African American. The disease usually presents in childhood and continues throughout the patient's life. The calcific masses are typically painless and grow at variable rates, sometimes becoming large and bulky. The masses are often located near major joints but remain extracapsular. Joint range of motion is not usually restricted unless the tumors are very large. Complications include compression of neural structures and ulceration of the overlying skin with drainage of chalky fluid and risk of secondary infection. Small deposits not detected by standard radiographs may be detected by 99mTc bone scanning. The most common laboratory findings are hyperphosphatemia and elevated serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels. Serum calcium, parathyroid hormone, and ALP levels are usually normal. Renal function is also usually normal. Urine calcium and phosphate excretions are low, and calcium and phosphate balances are positive.

An acquired form of the disease may occur with other causes of hyperphosphatemia, such as secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with hemodialysis, hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, and massive cell lysis following chemotherapy for leukemia. Tissue trauma from joint movement may contribute to the periarticular calcifications. Metastatic calcifications are also seen in conditions associated with hypercalcemia, such as in sarcoidosis, vitamin D intoxication, milk-alkali syndrome, and primary hyperparathyroidism. In these conditions, however, mineral deposits are more likely to occur in proton-transporting organs such as kidney, lungs, and gastric mucosa in which an alkaline milieu is generated by the proton pumps.

Treatment: Tumoral Calcinosis

Therapeutic successes have been achieved with surgical removal of subcutaneous calcified masses, which tend not to recur if all calcification is removed from the site. Reduction of serum phosphate by chronic phosphorus restriction may be accomplished using low dietary phosphorus intake alone or in combination with oral phosphate binders. The addition of the phosphaturic agent acetazolamide may be useful. Limited experience using the phosphaturic action of calcitonin deserves further testing.

Dystrophic Calcification

Posttraumatic calcification may occur with normal serum calcium and phosphate levels and normal ion-solubility product. The deposited mineral is either in the form of amorphous calcium phosphate or hydroxyapatite crystals. Soft tissue calcification complicating connective tissue disorders such as scleroderma, dermatomyositis, and systemic lupus erythematosus may involve localized areas of the skin or deeper subcutaneous tissue and is referred to as calcinosis circumscripta. Mineral deposition at sites of deeper tissue injury including periarticular sites is called calcinosis universalis.

Ectopic Ossification

True extraskeletal bone formation that begins in areas of fasciitis following surgery, trauma, burns, or neurologic injury is referred to as myositis ossificans. The bone formed is organized as lamellar or trabecular, with normal osteoblasts and osteoclasts conducting active remodeling. Well-developed haversian systems and marrow elements may be present. A second cause of ectopic bone formation occurs in an inherited disorder, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.

Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva

This is also called myositis ossificans progressiva; it is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by congenital deformities of the hands and feet and episodic soft tissue swellings that ossify. Ectopic bone formation occurs in fascia, tendons, ligaments, and connective tissue within voluntary muscles. Tender, rubbery induration, sometimes precipitated by trauma, develops in the soft tissue and gradually calcifies. Eventually, heterotopic bone forms at these sites of soft tissue trauma. Morbidity results from heterotopic bone interfering with normal movement and function of muscle and other soft tissues. Mortality is usually related to restrictive lung disease caused by an inability of the chest to expand. Laboratory tests are unremarkable.

There is no effective medical therapy. Bisphosphonates, glucocorticoids, and a low-calcium diet have largely been ineffective in halting progression of the ossification. Surgical removal of ectopic bone is not recommended, because the trauma of surgery may precipitate formation of new areas of heterotopic bone. Dental complications including frozen jaw may occur following injection of local anesthetics. Thus, CT imaging of the mandible should be undertaken to detect early sites of soft tissue ossification before they are appreciated by standard radiography.

 Chapter 356. Disorders of Lipoprotein Metabolism >
 

Disorders of Lipoprotein Metabolism: Introduction

Lipoproteins are complexes of lipids and proteins that are essential for the transport of cholesterol, triglycerides, and fat-soluble vitamins. Previously, lipoprotein disorders were the purview of specialized lipidologists, but the demonstration that lipid-lowering therapy significantly reduces the clinical complications of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) has brought the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders into the domain of the internist. The number of individuals who are candidates for lipid-lowering therapy has continued to increase. The development of safe, effective, and well-tolerated pharmacologic agents has greatly expanded the therapeutic armamentarium available to the physician to treat disorders of lipid metabolism. Therefore, the appropriate diagnosis and management of lipoprotein disorders is of critical importance in the practice of medicine. This chapter will review normal lipoprotein physiology, the pathophysiology of primary (inherited) disorders of lipoprotein metabolism, the diseases and environmental factors that cause secondary disorders of lipoprotein metabolism, and the practical approaches to their diagnosis and management.
 
Lipoprotein Metabolism

Lipoprotein Classification and Composition

Lipoproteins are large macromolecular complexes that transport hydrophobic lipids (primarily triglycerides, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins) through body fluids (plasma, interstitial fluid, and lymph) to and from tissues. Lipoproteins play an essential role in the absorption of dietary cholesterol, long-chain fatty acids, and fat-soluble vitamins; the transport of triglycerides, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins from the liver to peripheral tissues; and the transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver.

Lipoproteins contain a core of hydrophobic lipids (triglycerides and cholesteryl esters) surrounded by hydrophilic lipids (phospholipids, unesterified cholesterol) and proteins that interact with body fluids. The plasma lipoproteins are divided into five major classes based on their relative density (Fig. 356-1 and Table 356-1): chylomicrons, very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs), low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), and high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). Each lipoprotein class comprises a family of particles that vary slightly in density, size and protein composition. The density of a lipoprotein is determined by the amount of lipid per particle. HDL is the smallest and most dense lipoprotein, whereas chylomicrons and VLDLs are the largest and least dense lipoprotein particles. Most plasma triglyceride is transported in chylomicrons or VLDLs, and most plasma cholesterol is carried as cholesteryl esters in LDLs and HDLs.

The proteins associated with lipoproteins, called apolipoproteins(Table 356-2), are required for the assembly, structure, and function of lipoproteins. Apolipoproteins activate enzymes important in lipoprotein metabolism and act as ligands for cell surface receptors. ApoA-I, which is synthesized in the liver and intestine, is found on virtually all HDL particles. ApoA-II is the second most abundant HDL apolipoprotein and is on approximately two-thirds of the HDL particles. ApoB is the major structural protein of chylomicrons, VLDLs, IDLs, and LDLs; one molecule of apoB, either apoB-48 (chylomicron) or apoB-100 (VLDL, IDL or LDL), is present on each lipoprotein particle. The human liver synthesizes apoB-100, and the intestine makes apoB-48, which is derived from the same gene by mRNA editing. ApoE is present in multiple copies on chylomicrons, VLDL, and IDL, and it plays a critical role in the metabolism and clearance of triglyceride-rich particles. Three apolipoproteins of the C-series (apoC-I, apoC-II, and apoC-III) also participate in the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. ApoB is the only major apolipoprotein that does not transfer between lipoprotein particles. Some of the minor apolipoproteins are listed in Table 356-2.

Transport of Dietary Lipids (Exogenous Pathway)

The exogenous pathway of lipoprotein metabolism permits efficient transport of dietary lipids (Fig. 356-2). Dietary triglycerides are hydrolyzed by lipases within the intestinal lumen and emulsified with bile acids to form micelles. Dietary cholesterol, fatty acids, and fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed in the proximal small intestine. Cholesterol and retinol are esterified (by the addition of a fatty acid) in the enterocyte to form cholesteryl esters and retinyl esters, respectively. Longer-chain fatty acids (>12 carbons) are incorporated into triglycerides and packaged with apoB-48, cholesteryl esters, retinyl esters, phospholipids, and cholesterol to form chylomicrons. Nascent chylomicrons are secreted into the intestinal lymph and delivered via the thoracic duct directly to the systemic circulation, where they are extensively processed by peripheral tissues before reaching the liver. The particles encounter lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which is anchored to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, GPIHBP1, that is attached to the endothelial surfaces of capillaries in adipose tissue, heart, and skeletal muscle (Fig. 356-2). The triglycerides of chylomicrons are hydrolyzed by LPL, and free fatty acids are released. ApoC-II, which is transferred to circulating chylomicrons from HDL, acts as a required cofactor for LPL in this reaction. The released free fatty acids are taken up by adjacent myocytes or adipocytes and either oxidized to generate energy or reesterified and stored as triglyceride. Some of the released free fatty acids bind albumin before entering cells and are transported to other tissues, especially the liver. The chylomicron particle progressively shrinks in size as the hydrophobic core is hydrolyzed and the hydrophilic lipids (cholesterol and phospholipids) and apolipoproteins on the particle surface are transferred to HDL, creating chylomicron remnants. Chylomicron remnants are rapidly removed from the circulation by the liver through a process that requires apoE as a ligand for receptors in the liver. Consequently, few, if any, chylomicrons or chylomicron remnants are present in the blood after a 12-hour fast, except in patients with disorders of chylomicron metabolism.

Transport of Hepatic Lipids (Endogenous Pathway)

The endogenous pathway of lipoprotein metabolism refers to the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins from the liver and the metabolism of these triglyceride-rich particles in peripheral tissues (Fig. 356-2). VLDL particles resemble chylomicrons in protein composition but contain apoB-100 rather than apoB-48 and have a higher ratio of cholesterol to triglyceride (1 mg of cholesterol for every 5 mg of triglyceride). The triglycerides of VLDL are derived predominantly from the esterification of long-chain fatty acids in the liver. The packaging of hepatic triglycerides with the other major components of the nascent VLDL particle (apoB-100, cholesteryl esters, phospholipids, and vitamin E) requires the action of the enzyme microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). After secretion into the plasma, VLDL acquires multiple copies of apoE and apolipoproteins of the C series by transfer from HDL. As with chylomicrons, the triglycerides of VLDL are hydrolyzed by LPL, especially in muscle, heart, and adipose tissue. After the VLDL remnants dissociate from LPL, they are referred to as IDLs, which contain roughly similar amounts of cholesterol and triglyceride. The liver removes approximately 40每60% of IDL by LDL receptor每mediated endocytosis via binding to apoE. The remainder of IDL is remodeled by hepatic lipase (HL) to form LDL. During this process, most of the triglyceride in the particle hydrolyzed, and all apolipoproteins except apoB-100 are transferred to other lipoproteins. The cholesterol in LDL accounts for more than one-half of the plasma cholesterol in most individuals. Approximately 70% of circulating LDL is cleared by LDL receptor每mediated endocytosis in the liver. Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a lipoprotein similar to LDL in lipid and protein composition, but it contains an additional protein called apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)]. Apo(a) is synthesized in the liver and attached to apoB-100 by a disulfide linkage. The major site of clearance of Lp(a) is the liver, but the uptake pathway is not known.

HDL Metabolism and Reverse Cholesterol Transport

All nucleated cells synthesize cholesterol, but only hepatocytes and enterocytes can effectively excrete cholesterol from the body, into either the bile or the gut lumen. In the liver, cholesterol is secreted into the bile, either directly or after conversion to bile acids. Cholesterol in peripheral cells is transported from the plasma membranes of peripheral cells to the liver and intestine by a process termed "reverse cholesterol transport" that is facilitated by HDL (Fig. 356-3).

HDL metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport. This pathway transports excess cholesterol from the periphery back to the liver for excretion in the bile. The liver and the intestine produce nascent HDLs. Free cholesterol is acquired from macrophages and other peripheral cells and esterified by LCAT, forming mature HDLs. HDL cholesterol can be selectively taken up by the liver via SR-BI (scavenger receptor class BI). Alternatively, HDL cholesteryl ester can be transferred by CETP from HDLs to VLDLs and chylomicrons, which can then be taken up by the liver.

Nascent HDL particles are synthesized by the intestine and the liver. Newly secreted apoA-I rapidly acquires phospholipids and unesterified cholesterol from its site of synthesis (intestine or liver) via efflux promoted by the membrane protein ATP-binding cassette protein A1 (ABCA1). This process results in the formation of discoidal HDL particles, which then recruit additional unesterified cholesterol from the periphery. Within the HDL particle, the cholesterol is esterified by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), a plasma enzyme associated with HDL, and the more hydrophobic cholesteryl ester moves to the core of the HDL particle. As HDL acquires more cholesteryl ester it becomes spherical, and additional apolipoproteins and lipids are transferred to the particles from the surfaces of chylomicrons and VLDLs during lipolysis.

HDL cholesterol is transported to hepatocytes by both an indirect and a direct pathway. HDL cholesteryl esters can be transferred to apoB-containing lipoproteins in exchange for triglyceride by the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). The cholesteryl esters are then removed from the circulation by LDL receptor每mediated endocytosis. HDL cholesterol can also be taken up directly by hepatocytes via the scavenger receptor class B1 (SR-B1), a cell surface receptor that mediates the selective transfer of lipids to cells.

HDL particles undergo extensive remodeling within the plasma compartment by a variety of lipid transfer proteins and lipases. The phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) has the net effect of transferring phospholipids from other lipoproteins to HDL or among different classes of HDL particles. After CETP- and PLTP-mediated lipid exchange, the triglyceride-enriched HDL becomes a much better substrate for HL, which hydrolyzes the triglycerides and phospholipids to generate smaller HDL particles. A related enzyme called endothelial lipase hydrolyzes HDL phospholipids, generating smaller HDL particles that are catabolized faster. Remodeling of HDL influences the metabolism, function, and plasma concentrations of HDL.
 
Disorders of Lipoprotein Metabolism

Fredrickson and Levy classified hyperlipoproteinemias according to the type of lipoprotein particles that accumulate in the blood (Type I to Type V) (Table 356-3). A classification scheme based on the molecular etiology and pathophysiology of the lipoprotein disorders complements this system and forms the basis for this chapter. The identification and characterization of genes responsible for the genetic forms of hyperlipidemia have provided important molecular insights into the critical roles of structural apolipoproteins, enzymes, and receptors in lipid metabolism (Table 356-4).

Primary Disorders of Elevated Apob-Containing Lipoproteins

A variety of genetic conditions are associated with the accumulation in plasma of specific classes of lipoprotein particles. In general, these can be divided into those causing elevated LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) with normal triglycerides and those causing elevated triglycerides (Table 356-4).

Lipid Disorders Associated with Elevated LDL-C and Normal Triglycerides

Familial Hypercholesterolemia (Fh)

FH is an autosomal codominant disorder characterized by elevated plasma levels of LDL-C with normal triglycerides, tendon xanthomas, and premature coronary atherosclerosis. FH is caused by a large number (>1000) mutations in the LDL receptor gene. It has a higher incidence in certain founder populations, such as Afrikaners, Christian Lebanese, and French Canadians. The elevated levels of LDL-C in FH are due to an increase in the production of LDL from IDL (since a portion of IDL is normally cleared by LDL receptor每mediated endocytosis) and a delayed removal of LDL from the blood. Individuals with two mutated LDL receptor alleles (FH homozygotes) have much higher LDL-C levels than those with one mutant allele (FH heterozygotes).

Homozygous FH occurs in approximately 1 in 1 million persons worldwide. Patients with homozygous FH can be classified into one of two groups based on the amount of LDL receptor activity measured in their skin fibroblasts: those patients with <2% of normal LDL receptor activity (receptor negative) and those patients with 2每25% of normal LDL receptor activity (receptor defective). Most patients with homozygous FH present in childhood with cutaneous xanthomas on the hands, wrists, elbows, knees, heels, or buttocks. Total cholesterol levels are usually >500 mg/dL and can be higher than 1000 mg/dL. The devastating complication of homozygous FH is accelerated atherosclerosis, which can result in disability and death in childhood. Atherosclerosis often develops first in the aortic root, where it can cause aortic valvular or supravalvular stenosis, and typically extends into the coronary ostia, which become stenotic. Children with homozygous FH often develop symptomatic coronary atherosclerosis before puberty; symptoms can be atypical, and sudden death is not uncommon. Untreated, receptor-negative patients with homozygous FH rarely survive beyond the second decade; patients with receptor-defective LDL receptor defects have a better prognosis but almost invariably develop clinically apparent atherosclerotic vascular disease by age 30, and often much sooner. Carotid and femoral disease develops later in life and is usually not clinically significant.

A careful family history should be taken, and plasma lipid levels should be measured in the parents and other first-degree relatives of patients with homozygous FH. The disease has >90% penetrance so both parents of FH homozygotes usually have hypercholesterolemia. The diagnosis of homozygous FH can be confirmed by obtaining a skin biopsy and measuring LDL receptor activity in cultured skin fibroblasts, or by quantifying the number of LDL receptors on the surfaces of lymphocytes using cell sorting technology. Molecular assays are also available to define the mutations in the LDL receptor by DNA sequencing. In selected populations where particular mutations predominate (e.g., Africaners and French Canadians), the common mutations can be screened for directly. Alternatively, the entire coding region needs to be sequenced for mutation detection because a large number of different LDL receptor mutations can cause disease. Ten to 15% of LDL receptor mutations are large deletions or insertions, which may be missed by routine DNA sequencing.

Combination therapy with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and a second drug (cholesterol absorption inhibitor or bile acid sequestrant) sometimes reduces plasma LDL-C in those FH homozygotes who have residual LDL receptor activity, but patients with homozygous FH invariably require additional lipid-lowering therapy. Since the liver is quantitatively the most important tissue for removing circulating LDLs via the LDL receptor, liver transplantation is effective in decreasing plasma LDL-C levels in this disorder. Liver transplantation, however, is associated with substantial risks, including the requirement for long-term immunosuppression. The current treatment of choice for homozygous FH is LDL apheresis (a process by which the LDL particles are selectively removed from the circulation), which can promote regression of xanthomas and may slow the progression of atherosclerosis. Initiation of LDL apheresis should generally be delayed until approximately 5 years of age, except when evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease is present.

Heterozygous FH is caused by the inheritance of one mutant LDL receptor allele and occurs in approximately 1 in 500 persons worldwide, making it one of the most common single-gene disorders. It is characterized by elevated plasma levels of LDL-C (usually 200每400 mg/dL) and normal levels of triglyceride. Patients with heterozygous FH have hypercholesterolemia from birth, and disease recognition is usually based on detection of hypercholesterolemia on routine screening, the appearance of tendon xanthomas, or the development of symptomatic ASCVD. Since the disease is codominant in inheritance, one parent and 50% of the patient's siblings usually also have hypercholesterolemia. The family history is frequently positive for premature ASCVD on one side of the family. Corneal arcus is common, and tendon xanthomas involving the dorsum of the hands, elbows, knees, and especially the Achilles tendons are present in 75% of patients. The age of onset of ASCVD is highly variable and depends in part on the molecular defect in the LDL receptor gene and also on coexisting cardiac risk factors. FH heterozygotes with elevated plasma levels of Lp(a) appear to be at greater risk for cardiovascular complications. Untreated men with heterozygous FH have an 50% chance of having a myocardial infarction before age 60 years. Although the age of onset of atherosclerotic heart disease is later in women with FH, coronary heart disease (CHD) is significantly more common in women with FH than in the general female population.

No definitive diagnostic test for heterozygous FH is available. Although FH heterozygotes tend to have reduced levels of LDL receptor function in skin fibroblasts, significant overlap with the LDL receptor activity levels in normal fibroblasts exists. Molecular assays are now available to identify mutations in the LDL receptor gene by DNA sequencing, but the clinical utility of pinpointing the mutation has not been demonstrated. The clinical diagnosis is usually not problematic, but it is critical that hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, and obstructive liver disease be excluded before initiating therapy.

FH patients should be aggressively treated to lower plasma levels of LDL-C. Initiation of a low-cholesterol, low-fat diet is recommended, but heterozygous FH patients require lipid-lowering drug therapy. Statins are effective in heterozygous FH, but combination drug therapy with the addition of a cholesterol absorption inhibitor and/or bile acid sequestrant is frequently required, and the addition of nicotinic acid is sometimes needed. Heterozygous FH patients who cannot be adequately controlled on combination drug therapy are candidates for LDL apheresis.

Familial Defective Apob-100 (Fdb)

FDB is a dominantly inherited disorder that clinically resembles heterozygous FH. The disease is rare in most populations except individuals of German descent, where the frequency can be as high as 1 in 1000. FDB is characterized by elevated plasma LDL-C levels with normal triglycerides, tendon xanthomas, and an increased incidence of premature ASCVD. FDB is caused by mutations in the LDL receptor每binding domain of apoB-100, most commonly due to a substitution of glutamine for arginine at position 3500. As a consequence of the mutation in apoB-100, LDL binds the LDL receptor with reduced affinity, and LDL is removed from the circulation at a reduced rate. Patients with FDB cannot be clinically distinguished from patients with heterozygous FH, although patients with FDB tend to have lower plasma levels of LDL-C than FH heterozygotes. The apoB-100 gene mutation can be detected directly, but genetic diagnosis is not currently encouraged since the recommended management of FDB and heterozygous FH is identical.

Autosomal Dominant Hypercholesterolemia Due to Mutations in Pcsk9 (ADH-Pcsk9 or Adh3)

ADH-PCSK9 is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by gain-of-function mutations in proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). PCSK9 is a secreted protein that binds to the LDL receptor, resulting in its degradation. Normally, after LDL binds to the receptor it is internalized along with the receptor. In the low pH of the endosome, LDL dissociates from the receptor and returns to the cell surface. The LDL is delivered to the lysosome. When PCSK9 binds the receptor, the complex is internalized and the receptor is redirected to the lysosome rather than to the cell surface. The missense mutations in PCSK9 that cause hypercholesterolemia enhance the activity of PCSK9. As a consequence, the number of hepatic LDL receptors is reduced. Patients with ADH-PCSK9 are indistinguishable clinically from patients with FH. Interestingly, loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9 cause low LDL-C levels (see below).

Autosomal Recessive Hypercholesterolemia (Arh)

ARH is a rare disorder (except in Sardinia, Italy) due to mutations in a protein (ARH, also called LDLR adaptor protein, LDLRAP) involved in LDL receptor每mediated endocytosis in the liver. In the absence of LDLRAP, LDL binds to the LDL receptor but the lipoprotein-receptor complex fails to be internalized. ARH, like homozygous FH, is characterized by hypercholesterolemia, tendon xanthomas, and premature coronary artery disease (CAD). The levels of plasma LDL-C tend to be intermediate between the levels present in FH homozygotes and FH heterozygotes, and CAD is not usually symptomatic until at least the third decade. LDL receptor function in cultured fibroblasts is normal or only modestly reduced in ARH, whereas LDL receptor function in lymphocytes and the liver is negligible. Unlike FH homozygotes, the hyperlipidemia responds partially to treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, but these patients usually require LDL apheresis to lower plasma LDL-C to recommended levels.

Sitosterolemia

Sitosterolemia is another rare autosomal recessive disease that can result in severe hypercholesterolemia, tendon xanthomas, and premature ASCVD. Sitosterolemia is caused by mutations in either of two members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) half transporter family, ABCG5 and ABCG8. These genes are expressed in enterocytes and hepatocytes. The proteins heterodimerize to form a functional complex that pumps plant sterols such as sitosterol and campesterol, and animal sterols, predominantly cholesterol, into the gut lumen and into the bile. In normal individuals, <5% of dietary plant sterols are absorbed by the proximal small intestine and delivered to the liver. Absorbed plant sterols are preferentially secreted into the bile and are maintained at very low levels. In sitosterolemia, the intestinal absorption of sterols is increased and biliary excretion of the sterols is reduced, resulting in increased plasma and tissue levels of both plant sterols and cholesterol.

Incorporation of plant sterols into cell membranes results in misshapen red blood cells and megathrombocytes that are visible on blood smear. Episodes of hemolysis are a distinctive clinical feature of this disease compared to other genetic forms of hypercholesterolemia.

Sitosterolemia is diagnosed by demonstrating an increase in the plasma level of sitosterol using gas chromatography. The hypercholesterolemia is unusually responsive to reductions in dietary cholesterol content and should be suspected in individuals who have a >40% reduction in plasma cholesterol level on a low-cholesterol diet. The hypercholesterolemia does not respond to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, whereas bile acid sequestrants and cholesterol-absorption inhibitors such as ezetimibe, are effective in reducing plasma sterol levels in these patients.

Polygenic Hypercholesterolemia

This condition is characterized by hypercholesterolemia due to elevated LDL-C with a normal plasma level of triglyceride in the absence of secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia. Plasma LDL-C levels are generally not as elevated as they are in FH and FDB. Family studies are useful to differentiate polygenic hypercholesterolemia from the single-gene disorders described above; one-half of the first-degree relatives of patients with FH and FDB are hypercholesterolemic, whereas <10% of first-degree relatives of patients with polygenic hypercholesterolemia have hypercholesterolemia. Treatment of polygenic hypercholesterolemia is identical to that of other forms of hypercholesterolemia.

Elevated Plasma Levels of Lipoprotein(a)

Unlike the other major classes of lipoproteins, that have a normal distribution in the population, plasma levels of Lp(a) have a highly skewed distribution with levels varying over a 1000-fold range. Levels are strongly influenced by genetic factors, with individuals of African and South Asian descent having higher levels than those of European descent. Although it has been well documented that elevated levels of Lp(a) are associated with an increase in ASCVD, lowering plasma levels of Lp(a) has not been demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular risk.

Lipid Disorders Associated with Elevated Triglycerides

Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome (Type I Hyperlipoproteinemia; Lipoprotein Lipase and Apoc-II Deficiency)

As noted above, LPL is required for the hydrolysis of triglycerides in chylomicrons and VLDLs, and apoC-II is a cofactor for LPL (Fig. 356-2). Genetic deficiency or inactivity of either protein results in impaired lipolysis and profound elevations in plasma chylomicrons. These patients can also have elevated plasma levels of VLDL, but chylomicronemia predominates. The fasting plasma is turbid, and if left at 4∼C (39.2∼F) for a few hours, the chylomicrons float to the top and form a creamy supernatant. In these disorders, called familial chylomicronemia syndromes, fasting triglyceride levels are almost invariably >1000 mg/dL. Fasting cholesterol levels are also elevated but to a lesser degree.

LPL deficiency has autosomal recessive inheritance and has a frequency of approximately 1 in 1 million in the population. ApoC-II deficiency is also recessive in inheritance pattern and is even less common than LPL deficiency. Multiple different mutations in the LPL and apoC-II genes cause these diseases. Obligate LPL heterozygotes have normal or mild-to-moderate elevations in plasma triglyceride levels, whereas individuals heterozygous for mutation in apoC-II do not have hypertriglyceridemia.

Both LPL and apoC-II deficiency usually present in childhood with recurrent episodes of severe abdominal pain due to acute pancreatitis. On funduscopic examination, the retinal blood vessels are opalescent (lipemia retinalis). Eruptive xanthomas, which are small, yellowish-white papules, often appear in clusters on the back, buttocks, and extensor surfaces of the arms and legs. These typically painless skin lesions may become puritic. Hepatosplenomegaly results from the uptake of circulating chylomicrons by reticuloendothelial cells in the liver and spleen. For unknown reasons, some patients with persistent and pronounced chylomicronemia never develop pancreatitis, eruptive xanthomas, or hepatosplenomegaly. Premature CHD is not generally a feature of familial chylomicronemia syndromes.

The diagnoses of LPL and apoC-II deficiency are established enzymatically in specialized laboratories by assaying triglyceride lipolytic activity in postheparin plasma. Blood is sampled after an IV heparin injection to release the endothelial-bound LPL. LPL activity is profoundly reduced in both LPL and apoC-II deficiency; in patients with apoC-II deficiency, it normalizes after the addition of normal plasma (providing a source of apoC-II). Molecular sequencing of the genes can be used to confirm the diagnosis.

The major therapeutic intervention in familial chylomicronemia syndromes is dietary fat restriction (to as little as 15 g/d) with fat-soluble vitamin supplementation. Consultation with a registered dietician familiar with this disorder is essential. Caloric supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides, which are absorbed directly into the portal circulation, can be useful but may be associated with hepatic fibrosis if used for prolonged periods. If dietary fat restriction alone is not successful in resolving the chylomicronemia, fish oils have been effective in some patients. In patients with apoC-II deficiency, apoC-II can be provided by infusing fresh-frozen plasma to resolve the chylomicronemia in the acute setting. Management of patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome is particularly challenging during pregnancy when VLDL production is increased and may require plasmapheresis to remove the circulating chylomicrons.

Apoa-V Deficiency

Another apolipoprotein, ApoA-V, circulates at much lower concentrations than the other major apolipoproteins. Individuals harboring mutations in both ApoA-V alleles can present as adults with chylomicronemia. The exact mechanism of action of ApoA-V is not known, but it appears to be required for the association of VLDL and chylomicrons with LPL.

Gpihbp1 Deficiency

After LPL is synthesized in adipocytes, myocytes or other cells, it is transported across the vascular endothelium and is attached to a protein on the endothelial surface of capillaries called GPIHBP1. Homozygosity for mutations that interfere with GPIHBP1 synthesis or folding cause severe hypertriglyceridemia. The frequency of chylomicronemia due to mutations in GHIHBP1 has not been established but appears to be very rare.

Hepatic Lipase Deficiency

HL is a member of the same gene family as LPL and hydrolyzes triglycerides and phospholipids in remnant lipoproteins and HDLs. HL deficiency is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by elevated plasma levels of cholesterol and triglycerides (mixed hyperlipidemia) due to the accumulation of circulating lipoprotein remnants and either a normal or elevated plasma level of HDL-C. The diagnosis is confirmed by measuring HL activity in postheparin plasma. Due to the small number of patients with HL deficiency, the association of this genetic defect with ASCVD is not clearly known, but lipid-lowering therapy is recommended.

Familial Dysbetalipoproteinemia (Type III Hyperlipoproteinemia)

Like HL deficiency, familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (FDBL) (also known as type III hyperlipoproteinemia or familial broad  disease) is characterized by a mixed hyperlipidemia due to the accumulation of remnant lipoprotein particles. ApoE is present in multiple copies on chylomicron and VLDL remnants and mediates their removal via hepatic lipoprotein receptors (Fig. 356-2). FDBL is due to genetic variations in apoE that interfere with its ability to bind lipoprotein receptors. The APOE gene is polymorphic in sequence, resulting in the expression of three common isoforms: apoE3, which is the most common; and apoE2 and apoE4, which both differ from apoE3 by a single amino acid. Although associated with slightly higher LDL-C levels and increased CHD risk, the apoE4 allele is not associated with FDBL. Patients with apoE4 have an increased incidence of late-onset Alzheimer's disease. ApoE2 has a lower affinity for the LDL receptor; therefore, chylomicron and VLDL remnants containing apoE2 are removed from plasma at a slower rate. Individuals who are homozygous for the E2 allele (the E2/E2 genotype) comprise the most common subset of patients with FDBL.

Approximately 0.5% of the general population are apoE2/E2 homozygotes, but only a small minority of these individuals develop FDBL. In most cases, an additional, identifiable factor precipitates the development of hyperlipoproteinemia. The most common precipitating factors are a high-fat diet, diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypothyroidism, renal disease, HIV infection, estrogen deficiency, alcohol use, or certain drugs. Other mutations in apoE can cause a dominant form of FDBL where the hyperlipidemia is fully manifest in the heterozygous state, but these mutations are rare.

Patients with FDBL usually present in adulthood with incidental hyperlipidemia, xanthomas, premature coronary disease, or peripheral vascular disease. The disease seldom presents in women before menopause. Two distinctive types of xanthomas, tuberoeruptive and palmar, are seen in FDBL patients. Tuberoeruptive xanthomas begin as clusters of small papules on the elbows, knees, or buttocks and can grow to the size of small grapes. Palmar xanthomas (alternatively called xanthomata striata palmaris) are orange-yellow discolorations of the creases in the palms and wrists. In FDBL, in contrast to other disorders of elevated triglycerides, the plasma levels of cholesterol and triglyceride are often elevated to a similar degree and the level of HDL-C is usually normal rather than being low.

The traditional approaches to diagnosis of this disorder are lipoprotein electrophoresis (broad  band) or ultracentrifugation (ratio of VLDL-C to total plasma triglyceride >0.30). Protein methods (apoE phenotyping) or DNA-based methods (apoE genotyping) can be performed to confirm homozygosity for apoE2. However, absence of the apoE2/E2 genotype does not rule out the diagnosis of FDBL, since other mutations in apoE can cause this condition.

Since FDBL is associated with increased risk of premature ASCVD, it should be treated aggressively. Subjects with FDBL tend to have more peripheral vascular disease than is typically seen in FH. Other metabolic conditions that can worsen the hyperlipidemia (see above) should be aggressively treated. Patients with FDBL are typically very diet-responsive and can respond favorably to weight reduction and to low-cholesterol, low-fat diets. Alcohol intake should be curtailed. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, fibrates, and niacin are all generally effective in the treatment of FDBL, and sometimes combination drug therapy is required.

Familial Hypertriglyceridemia (Fhtg)

FHTG is a relatively common (1 in 500) autosomal dominant disorder of unknown etiology characterized by moderately elevated plasma triglycerides accompanied by more modest elevations in cholesterol. Since the major class of lipoproteins elevated in this disorder is VLDL, patients with this disorder are often referred to as having Type IV hyperlipoproteinemia (Fredrickson classification, Table 356-3). The elevated plasma levels of VLDL are due to increased production of VLDL, impaired catabolism of VLDL, or a combination of these mechanisms. Some patients with FHTG have a more severe form of hyperlipidemia in which both VLDLs and chylomicrons are elevated (Type V hyperlipidemia), since these two classes of lipoproteins compete for the same lipolytic pathway. Increased intake of simple carbohydrates, obesity, insulin resistance, alcohol use, and estrogen treatment, all of which increase VLDL synthesis, can exacerbate this syndrome. FHTG appears not to be associated with increased risk of ASCVD in many families.

The diagnosis of FHTG is suggested by the triad of elevated levels of plasma triglycerides (250每1000 mg/dL), normal or only mildly increased cholesterol levels (<250 mg/dL), and reduced plasma levels of HDL-C. Plasma LDL-C levels are generally not increased and are often reduced due to defective metabolism of the triglyceride-rich particles, The identification of other first-degree relatives with hypertriglyceridemia is useful in making the diagnosis. FDBL and familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) should also be ruled out since these two conditions are associated with a significantly increased risk of ASCVD. The plasma apoB levels are lower and the ratio of plasma triglyceride to cholesterol is higher in FHTG than in either FDBL or FCHL.

It is important to consider and rule out secondary causes of the hypertriglyceridemia (Table 356-5) before making the diagnosis of FHTG. Lipid-lowering drug therapy can frequently be avoided with appropriate dietary and lifestyle changes. Patients with plasma triglyceride levels >500 mg/dL after a trial of diet and exercise should be considered for drug therapy to avoid the development of chylomicronemia and pancreatitis. Fibrate drugs or fish oils (omega 3 fatty acids) are reasonable first-line approaches for FHTG, and niacin can also be considered in this condition. For more moderate elevations in triglyceride levels (250-500 mg/dL), statins are effective at lowering triglyceride levels.

Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia (Fchl)

FCHL is generally characterized by moderate elevations in plasma levels of triglycerides (VLDL) and cholesterol (LDL) and reduced plasma levels of HDL-C. Approximately 20% of patients who develop CHD under age 60 have FCHL. The disease appears to be autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance and affected family members typically have one of three possible phenotypes: (1) elevated plasma levels of LDL-C, (2) elevated plasma levels of triglycerides due to elevation in VLDL, or (3) elevated plasma levels of both LDL-C and triglyceride. A classic feature of FCHL is that the lipoprotein profile can switch among these three phenotypes in the same individual over time and may depend on factors such as diet, exercise, and weight. FCHL can manifest in childhood but is usually not fully expressed until adulthood. A cluster of other metabolic risk factors are often found in association with this hyperlipidemia, including obesity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and hypertension (the so-called metabolic syndrome, Chap. 242). These patients do not develop xanthomas.

Patients with FCHL almost always have significantly elevated plasma levels of apoB. The levels of apoB are disproportionately high relative to the plasma LDL-C concentration, indicating the presence of small, dense LDL particles, which are characteristic of this syndrome. Hyperapobetalipoproteinemia, which has been used to describe the state of elevated plasma levels of apoB with normal plasma LDL-C levels, is probably a form of FCHL. Individuals with FCHL generally share the same metabolic defect, which is overproduction of VLDL by the liver. The molecular etiology of FCHL remains poorly understood, and it is likely that defects in several different genes can cause the phenotype of FCHL.

The presence of a mixed dyslipidemia (plasma triglyceride levels between 200 and 800 mg/dL and total cholesterol levels between 200 and 400 mg/dL, usually with HDL-C levels <40 mg/dL in men and <50 mg/dL in women) and a family history of hyperlipidemia and/or premature CHD strongly suggests the diagnosis of FCHL.

Individuals with FCHL should be treated aggressively due to significantly increased risk of premature CHD. Decreased dietary intake of saturated fat and simple carbohydrates, aerobic exercise, and weight loss can all have beneficial effects on the lipid profile. Patients with diabetes should be aggressively treated to maintain good glucose control. Most patients with FCHL require lipid-lowering drug therapy to reduce lipoprotein levels to the recommended range and reduce the high risk of ASCVD. Statins are effective in this condition, but many patients will require a second drug (cholesterol absorption inhibitor, niacin, fibrate, or fish oils) for optimal control of lipoprotein levels.

Inherited Causes of Low Levels of Apob-Containing Lipoproteins

Familial Hypobetalipoproteinemia (Fhb)

Low plasma levels of LDL-C (the "-lipoprotein") with a genetic or inherited basis are referred to generically as familial hypobetalipoproteinemia. Traditionally this term has been used to refer to the condition of low total cholesterol and LDL-C due to mutations in apoB, which represents the most common inherited form of hypocholesterolemia. Most of the mutations causing FHB interfere with the production of apoB, resulting in reduced secretion and/or accelerated catabolism of the protein. Individuals heterozygous for these mutations usually have LDL-C levels <80 mg/dL and may enjoy protection from ASCVD, though this has not been rigorously demonstrated. Some heterozygotes have elevated levels of hepatic triglycerides.

Mutations in both apoB alleles cause homozygous FHB, a disorder resembling abetalipoproteinemia (see below), although the neurologic findings tend to be less severe. Patients with homozygous hypobetalipoproteinemia can be distinguished from individuals with abetalipoproteinemia by measuring the levels of LDL-C in the parents, which are low in hypobetalipoproteinemia and normal in abetalipoproteinemia.

Pcsk9 Deficiency

A phenocopy of FHB results from loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9. As reviewed previously, PCSK9 normally promotes the degradation of the LDL receptor. Mutations that interfere with the synthesis of PCSK9, which are more common in individuals of African descent, result in increased LDL receptor activity and 40% reduction in plasma level of LDL-C. A sequence variation of higher frequency (R46L) is found predominantly in individuals of European descent and is associated with a 15% reduction in LDL-C. Individuals with inactivating mutations are protected from developing CHD relative to those without these sequence variations, presumably due to having lower plasma cholesterol levels since birth.

Abetalipoproteinemia

The synthesis and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins in the enterocytes of the proximal small bowel and in the hepatocytes of the liver involve a complex series of events that coordinate the coupling of various lipids with apoB-48 and apoB-100, respectively. Abetalipoproteinemia is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), a protein that transfers lipids to nascent chylomicrons and VLDLs in the intestine and liver, respectively. Plasma levels of cholesterol and triglyceride are extremely low in this disorder, and chylomicrons, VLDLs, LDLs, and apoB are undetectable in plasma. The parents of patients with abetalipoproteinemia (obligate heterozygotes) have normal plasma lipid and apoB levels. Abetalipoproteinemia usually presents in early childhood with diarrhea and failure to thrive due to fat malabsorption. The initial neurologic manifestations are loss of deep-tendon reflexes, followed by decreased distal lower extremity vibratory and proprioceptive sense, dysmetria, ataxia, and the development of a spastic gait, often by the third or fourth decade. Patients with abetalipoproteinemia also develop a progressive pigmented retinopathy presenting with decreased night and color vision, followed by reductions in daytime visual acuity and ultimately progressing to near-blindness. The presence of spinocerebellar degeneration and pigmented retinopathy in this disease has resulted in some patients with abetalipoproteinemia being misdiagnosed as having Friedreich's ataxia.

Most clinical manifestations of abetalipoproteinemia result from defects in the absorption and transport of fat-soluble vitamins. Vitamin E and retinyl esters are normally transported from enterocytes to the liver by chylomicrons, and vitamin E is dependent on VLDL for transport out of the liver and into the circulation. As a consequence of the inability of these patients to secrete apoB-containing particles, patients with abetalipoproteinemia are markedly deficient in vitamin E and are also mildly to moderately deficient in vitamins A and K. Patients with abetalipoproteinemia should be referred to specialized centers for confirmation of the diagnosis and appropriate therapy. Treatment consists of a low-fat, high-caloric, vitamin-enriched diet accompanied by large supplemental doses of vitamin E. It is imperative that treatment be initiated as soon as possible to help forestall development of neurologic sequelae, which can progress even with appropriate therapy. New therapies for this serious disease are needed.

Genetic Disorders of HDL Metabolism

Mutations in genes encoding proteins that play critical roles in HDL synthesis and catabolism can result in both reductions and elevations in plasma levels of HDL-C. Unlike the genetic forms of hypercholesterolemia, which are invariably associated with premature coronary atherosclerosis, genetic forms of hypoalphalipoproteinemia (low HDL-C) are not always associated with accelerated atherosclerosis.

Inherited Causes of Low Levels of HDL-C

Gene Deletions in the Apoav-Ai-Ciii-Aiv Locus and Coding Mutations in Apoa-I

Complete genetic deficiency of apoA-I due to deletion of the apoA-I gene results in the virtual absence of HDL from the plasma. The genes encoding apoA-I, apoC-III, apoA-IV, and apoA-V are clustered together on chromosome 11, and some patients with no apoA-I have genomic deletions that include other genes in the cluster. ApoA-I is required for LCAT activity. In the absence of LCAT, free cholesterol levels increase in both HDL and in tissues. The free cholesterol can form deposits in the cornea and in the skin, resulting in corneal opacities and planar xanthomas. Premature CHD is a common feature of apoA-I deficiency, especially when additional genes in the complex are also deleted.

Missense and nonsense mutations in the apoA-I gene have been identified in some patients with low plasma levels of HDL-C (usually 15每30 mg/dL), but these are very rare causes of low HDL-C levels. Patients heterozygous for an Arg173Cys substitution in APOAI (so-called apoA-IMilano) have very low plasma levels of HDL due to impaired LCAT activation and rapid catabolism of the mutant apolipoprotein and yet have no increased risk of premature CHD. Most other individuals with low plasma HDL-C levels due to missense mutations in apoA-I do not appear to have premature CHD. A few selected missense mutations in apoA-I and apoA-II promote the formation of amyloid fibrils causing systemic amyloidosis.

Tangier Disease (Abca1 Deficiency)

Tangier disease is a very rare autosomal codominant form of extremely low plasma HDL-C caused by mutations in the gene encoding ABCA1, a cellular transporter that facilitates efflux of unesterified cholesterol and phospholipids from cells to apoA-I (Fig. 356-3). ABCA1 in the liver and intestine rapidly lipidates the apoA-I secreted from these tissues. In the absence of ABCA1, the nascent, poorly lipidated apoA-I is immediately cleared from the circulation. Thus, patients with Tangier disease have extremely low circulating plasma levels of HDL-C (<5 mg/dL) and apoA-I (<5 mg/dL). Cholesterol accumulates in the reticuloendothelial system of these patients, resulting in hepatosplenomegaly and pathognomonic enlarged, grayish yellow or orange tonsils. An intermittent peripheral neuropathy (mononeuritis multiplex) or a sphingomyelia-like neurologic disorder can also be seen in this disorder. Tangier disease is probably associated with some increased risk of premature atherosclerotic disease, although the association is not as robust as might be anticipated, given the very low levels of HDL-C and apoA-I in these patients. Patients with Tangier disease also have low plasma levels of LDL-C, which may attenuate the atherosclerotic risk. Obligate heterozygotes for ABCA1 mutations have moderately reduced plasma HDL-C levels (15每30 mg/dL) but their risk of premature CHD remains uncertain. ABCA1 mutations appear to be the cause of low HDL-C in a minority of individuals.

Lcat Deficiency

This very rare autosomal recessive disorder is caused by mutations in LCAT, an enzyme synthesized in the liver and secreted into the plasma, where it circulates associated with lipoproteins (Fig. 356-3). As reviewed previously, the enzyme is activated by apoA-I and mediates the esterification of cholesterol to form cholesteryl esters. Consequently, in LCAT deficiency the proportion of free cholesterol in circulating lipoproteins is greatly increased (from 25% to >70% of total plasma cholesterol). Lack of normal cholesterol esterification impairs formation of mature HDL particles, resulting in the rapid catabolism of circulating apoA-I. Two genetic forms of LCAT deficiency have been described in humans: complete deficiency (also called classic LCAT deficiency) and partial deficiency (also called fish-eye disease). Progressive corneal opacification due to the deposition of free cholesterol in the cornea, very low plasma levels of HDL-C (usually <10 mg/dL), and variable hypertriglyceridemia are characteristic of both disorders. In partial LCAT deficiency, there are no other known clinical sequelae. In contrast, patients with complete LCAT deficiency have hemolytic anemia and progressive renal insufficiency that eventually leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Remarkably, despite the extremely low plasma levels of HDL-C and apoA-I, premature ASCVD is not a consistent feature of either LCAT deficiency or fish eye disease. The diagnosis can be confirmed in a specialized laboratory by assaying plasma LCAT activity or by sequencing the LCAT gene.

Primary Hypoalphalipoproteinemia

Low plasma levels of HDL-C (the "alpha lipoprotein") is referred to as hypoalphalipoproteinemia. Primary hypoalphalipoproteinemia is defined as a plasma HDL-C level below the tenth percentile in the setting of relatively normal cholesterol and triglyceride levels, no apparent secondary causes of low plasma HDL-C, and no clinical signs of LCAT deficiency or Tangier disease. This syndrome is often referred to as isolated low HDL. A family history of low HDL-C facilitates the diagnosis of an inherited condition, which usually follows an autosomal dominant pattern. The metabolic etiology of this disease appears to be primarily accelerated catabolism of HDL and its apolipoproteins. Some of these patients may have ABCA1 mutations and therefore technically have heterozygous Tangier disease. Several kindreds with primary hypoalphalipoproteinemia have been described in association with an increased incidence of premature CHD, although this is not an invariant association. Association of hypoalphalipoproteinemia with premature CHD may depend on the specific nature of the gene defect or the underlying metabolic defect responsible for the low plasma HDL-C level.

Inherited Causes of High Levels of HDL-C

Cetp Deficiency

Loss-of-function mutations in both alleles of the gene encoding CETP cause substantially elevated HDL-C levels (usually >150 mg/dL). As noted above, CETP facilitates the transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to apoB-containing lipoproteins (Fig. 356-3). The absence of this transfer results in an increase in the cholesteryl ester content of HDL and a reduction in plasma levels of LDL-C. The large, cholesterol-rich HDL particles circulating in these patients are cleared at a reduced rate. CETP deficiency was first diagnosed in Japanese persons and is rare outside of Japan. The relationship of CETP deficiency to ASCVD remains unresolved. Heterozygotes for CETP deficiency have only modestly elevated HDL-C levels. Based on the phenotype of high HDL-C in CETP deficiency, pharmacologic inhibition of CETP is under development as a new therapeutic approach to both raise HDL-C levels and lower LDL-C levels, but whether it will reduce risk of ASCVD remains to be determined.

Familial Hyperalphalipoproteinemia

The condition of high plasma levels of HDL-C is referred to as hyperalphalipoproteinemia and is defined as a plasma HDL-C level above the ninetieth percentile. This trait runs in families, and outside of Japan it is unlikely to be due to CETP deficiency. Most, but not all, persons with this condition appear to have a reduced risk of CHD and increased longevity. Recent evidence is consistent with mutations in endothelial lipase contributing to this phenotype in some cases.

Secondary Disorders of Lipoprotein Metabolism

Significant changes in plasma levels of lipoproteins are seen in a variety of diseases. It is crucial that secondary causes of dyslipidemias (Table 356-5) are considered prior to initiation of lipid-lowering therapy.

Obesity

(See also Chaps. 77 and 78) Obesity is frequently accompanied by dyslipidemia. The increase in adipocyte mass and accompanying decreased insulin sensitivity associated with obesity has multiple effects on lipid metabolism. More free fatty acids are delivered from the expanded adipose tissue to the liver, where they are reesterified in hepatocytes to form triglycerides, which are packaged into VLDLs for secretion into the circulation. The increased insulin levels promote fatty acid synthesis in the liver. Increased dietary intake of simple carbohydrates also drives hepatic production of VLDLs, resulting in elevations in VLDL and/or LDL in some obese subjects. Plasma levels of HDL-C tend to be low in obesity, due in part to reduced lipolysis. Weight loss is often associated with reductions in plasma levels of circulating apoB-containing lipoproteins and increases in the plasma levels of HDL-C.

Diabetes Mellitus

(See also Chap. 344) Patients with type I diabetes mellitus generally do not have hyperlipidemia if they remain under good glycemic control. Diabetic ketoacidosis is frequently accompanied by hypertriglyceridemia due to an increased hepatic influx of free fatty acids from adipose tissue. Patients with type II diabetes mellitus are usually dyslipidemic, even when under relatively good glycemic control. The high levels of insulin and insulin resistance associated with type II diabetes has multiple effects on fat metabolism: (1) a decrease in LPL activity resulting in reduced catabolism of chylomicrons and VLDLs, (2) an increase in the release of free fatty acid from the adipose tissue, (3) an increase in fatty acid synthesis in the liver, and (4) an increase in hepatic VLDL production. Patients with type II diabetes mellitus have several lipid abnormalities, including elevated plasma triglycerides (due to increased VLDL and lipoprotein remnants), elevated levels of dense LDL, and decreased plasma levels of HDL-C. In some diabetic patients, especially those with a genetic defect in lipid metabolism, the triglycerides can be extremely elevated, resulting in the development of pancreatitis. Elevated plasma LDL-C levels usually are not a feature of diabetes mellitus and suggest the presence of an underlying lipoprotein abnormality or may indicate the development of diabetic nephropathy.

Lipodystrophy is associated with profound insulin resistance and elevated plasma levels of VLDL and chylomicrons that can be especially difficult to control. Those with congenital generalized lipodystrophy have absence of subcutaneous fat associated with muscle hypertrophy and hepatic steatosis; some of these patients have been treated successfully with leptin. Partial lipodystropy can present with dyslipidemia and the diagnosis should be entertained in patients with variations in body fat distribution, particularly increased truncal fat accompanied by reduced fat in the buttocks and extremities.

Thyroid Disease

(See also Chap. 341) Hypothyroidism is associated with elevated plasma LDL-C levels due primarily to a reduction in hepatic LDL receptor function and delayed clearance of LDL. Conversely, plasma levels of LDL-C are often reduced in the hyperthyroid patient. Hypothyroid patients also frequently have increased levels of circulating IDL, and some patients with hypothyroidism also have mild hypertriglyceridemia. Because hypothyroidism is often subtle and therefore easily overlooked, all patients presenting with elevated plasma levels of LDL-C, IDL or triglycerides should be screened for hypothyroidism. Thyroid replacement therapy usually ameliorates the hypercholesterolemia; if not, the patient probably has a primary lipoprotein disorder and may require lipid-lowering drug therapy.

Renal Disorders

(See also Chap. 280) Nephrotic syndrome is often associated with pronounced hyperlipoproteinemia, which is usually mixed but can manifest as hypercholesterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia. The hyperlipidemia of nephrotic syndrome appears to be due to a combination of increased hepatic production and decreased clearance of VLDLs, with increased LDL production. Effective treatment of the underlying renal disease normalizes the lipid profile, but most patients with chronic nephrotic syndrome require lipid-lowering drug therapy.

ESRD is often associated with mild hypertriglyceridemia (<300 mg/dL) due to the accumulation of VLDLs and remnant lipoproteins in the circulation. Triglyceride lipolysis and remnant clearance are both reduced in patients with renal failure. Because the risk of ASCVD is increased in ESRD subjects with hyperlipidemia, they should probably be aggressively treated with lipid-lowering agents, even though there is inadequate data at present to indicate that this population benefits from LDL-lowering therapy.

Patients with renal transplants usually have increased lipid levels due to the effect of the drugs required for immunosuppression (cyclosporine and glucocorticoids) and present a difficult management problem since HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors must be used cautiously in these patients.

Liver Disorders

(See also Chap. 301) Because the liver is the principal site of formation and clearance of lipoproteins, it is not surprising that liver diseases can affect plasma lipid levels in a variety of ways. Hepatitis due to infection, drugs, or alcohol is often associated with increased VLDL synthesis and mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia. Severe hepatitis and liver failure are associated with dramatic reductions in plasma cholesterol and triglycerides due to reduced lipoprotein biosynthetic capacity. Cholestasis is associated with hypercholesterolemia, which can be very severe. A major pathway by which cholesterol is excreted from the body is via secretion into bile, either directly or after conversion to bile acids, and cholestasis blocks this critical excretory pathway. In cholestasis, free cholesterol, coupled with phospholipids, is secreted into the plasma as a constituent of a lamellar particle called LP-X. The particles can deposit in skinfolds, producing lesions resembling those seen in patients with FDBL (xanthomata strata palmaris). Planar and eruptive xanthomas can also be seen in patients with cholestasis.

Alcohol

Regular alcohol consumption has a variable effect on plasma lipid levels. The most common effect of alcohol is to increase plasma triglyceride levels. Alcohol consumption stimulates hepatic secretion of VLDL, possibly by inhibiting the hepatic oxidation of free fatty acids, which then promote hepatic triglyceride synthesis and VLDL secretion. The usual lipoprotein pattern seen with alcohol consumption is Type IV (increased VLDLs), but persons with an underlying primary lipid disorder may develop severe hypertriglyceridemia (Type V) if they drink alcohol. Regular alcohol use also raises plasma levels of HDL-C.

Estrogen

Estrogen administration is associated with increased VLDL and HDL synthesis, resulting in elevated plasma levels of both triglycerides and HDL-C. This lipoprotein pattern is distinctive since the levels of plasma triglyceride and HDL-C are typically inversely related. Plasma triglyceride levels should be monitored when birth control pills or postmenopausal estrogen therapy is initiated to ensure that the increase in VLDL production does not lead to severe hypertriglyceridemia. Use of low-dose preparations of estrogen or the estrogen patch can minimize the effect of exogenous estrogen on lipids.

Lysosomal Storage Diseases

(See also Chap. 361) Cholesteryl ester storage disease (due to deficiency in lysosomal acid lipase) and glycogen storage diseases such as von Gierke's disease (caused by mutations in glucose-6-phosphatase) are rare causes of secondary hyperlipidemias.

Cushing's Syndrome

(See also Chap. 342) Glucocorticoid excess is associated with increased VLDL synthesis and hypertriglyceridemia. Patients with Cushing's syndrome can also have mild elevations in plasma levels of LDL-C.

Drugs

Many drugs have an impact on lipid metabolism and can result in significant alterations in the lipoprotein profile (Table 356-5).

Screening

(See also Chaps. 225 and 242) Guidelines for the screening and management of lipid disorders have been provided by an expert Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) convened by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The NCEP ATPIII guidelines published in 2001 recommend that all adults older than age 20 years should have plasma levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-C, and HDL-C measured after a 12-hour overnight fast. In most clinical laboratories, the total cholesterol and triglycerides in the plasma are measured enzymatically, and then the cholesterol in the supernatant is measured after precipitation of apoB-containing lipoproteins to determine the HDL-C. The LDL-C is estimated using the following equation:

LDL-C = total cholesterol 每 (triglycerides/5) 每 HDL-C.

(The VLDL-C is estimated by dividing the plasma triglyceride by 5, reflecting the ratio of cholesterol to triglyceride in VLDL particles.) This formula is reasonably accurate if test results are obtained on fasting plasma and if the triglyceride level does not exceed 200 mg/dL; by convention it cannot be used if the triglyceride level is >400 mg/dL. The accurate determination of LDL-C levels in patients with triglyceride levels >200 mg/dL requires application of ultracentrifugation techniques or other direct assays for LDL-C. If the triglyceride level is >200 mg/dL, the guidelines recommend that the "non-HDL-C" be calculated by simple subtraction of HDL-C from the total cholesterol and that this be considered a secondary target of therapy. Further evaluation and treatment is based primarily on the plasma LDL-C and non-HDL-C levels as well as assessment of overall cardiovascular risk.

Diagnosis

The critical first step in managing a lipid disorder is to determine the class or classes of lipoproteins that are increased or decreased in the patient. The Fredrickson classification scheme for hyperlipoproteinemias (Table 356-3), though less commonly used now than in the past, can be helpful in this regard. Once the hyperlipidemia is accurately classified, efforts should be directed to rule out any possible secondary causes of the hyperlipidemia (Table 356-5). Although many patients with hyperlipidemia have a primary or genetic cause of their lipid disorder, secondary factors frequently contribute to the hyperlipidemia. A fasting glucose should be obtained in the initial workup of all subjects with an elevated triglyceride level. Nephrotic syndrome and chronic renal insufficiency should be excluded by obtaining urine protein and serum creatinine. Liver function tests should be performed to rule out hepatitis and cholestasis. Hypothyroidism should be ruled out by measuring serum TSH. Patients with hyperlipidemia, especially hypertriglyceridemia, who drink alcohol should be encouraged to decrease their intake. Sedentary lifestyle, obesity, and smoking are all associated with low HDL-C levels, and patients should be counseled about these issues.

Once secondary causes for the elevated lipoprotein levels have been ruled out, attempts should be made to diagnose the primary lipid disorder since the underlying etiology has a significant effect on the risk of developing CHD, on the response to drug therapy, and on the management of other family members. Often, determining the correct diagnosis requires a detailed family medical history and, in some cases, lipid analyses in family members.

If the fasting plasma triglyceride level is >1000 mg/dL, the patient almost always has chylomicronemia and either has Type I or Type V hyperlipoproteinemia (Table 356-3). The plasma triglyceride to cholesterol ratio helps distinguish between these two possibilities and is higher in Type I than Type V hyperlipoproteinemia. If the patient has Type I hyperlipoproteinemia, a postheparin lipolytic assay should be performed to determine if the patient has LPL or apoC-II deficiency. Type V is a much more frequent form of chylomicronemia in the adult patient. Often treatment of secondary factors contributing to the hyperlipidemia (diet, obesity, glucose intolerance, alcohol ingestion, estrogen therapy) will change a Type V into a Type IV pattern, reducing the risk of developing acute pancreatitis.

If the levels of LDL-C are very high (greater than a ninety-fifth percentile), it is likely the patient has a genetic form of hyperlipidemia. The presence of severe hypercholesterolemia, tendon xanthomas, and an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance are consistent with the diagnosis of either FH, FDB, or ADH-PCSK9. At the present time, there is no compelling reason to perform molecular studies to further refine the molecular diagnosis, since the treatment of FH and FDB is identical. Recessive forms of severe hypercholesterolemia are rare and if the patient with severe hypercholesterolemia has parents with normal cholesterol levels, sitosterolemia should be considered; a clue to the diagnosis of sitosterolemia is the greater than expected response of the hypercholesterolemia to reductions in dietary cholesterol content or to treatment with either a cholesterol absorption inhibitor (ezetimibe) or to bile acid resins. Patients with more moderate hypercholesterolemia that does not segregate in families as a monogenic trait are likely to have polygenic hypercholesterolemia.

The most common error in the diagnosis and treatment of lipid disorders is in patients with a mixed hyperlipidemia without chylomicronemia. Elevations in the plasma levels of both cholesterol and triglycerides are seen in patients with increased plasma levels of IDL (Type III) and of LDL and VLDL (Type IIB) and in patients with increased levels of VLDL (Type IV). The ratio of triglyceride to cholesterol is higher in Type IV than the other two disorders. The plasma levels of apoB are highest in Type IIB. A beta quantification to determine the VLDL-C/triglyceride ratio in plasma (see discussion of FDBL) or a direct measurement of the plasma LDL-C should be performed at least once prior to initiation of lipid-lowering therapy to determine if the hyperlipidemia is due to the accumulation of remnants or to an increase in both LDL and VLDL.

Treatment: Lipoprotein Disorders

Clinical Evidence that Treatment of Dyslipidemia Reduces Risk of CHD

Observational Data

Multiple epidemiologic studies have demonstrated a strong relationship between plasma levels of LDL-C and CHD. A direct connection between plasma cholesterol levels and the atherosclerotic process was made in humans when aortic fatty streaks in young persons were shown to be strongly correlated with serum cholesterol levels. The elucidation of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia was proof that high plasma levels of LDL-C alone are sufficient to cause CAD. Moreover, PCSK9 deficiency proves that having a lifelong reduction in plasma level of LDL-C is associated with a marked reduction in cardiovascular risk.

Clinical Trials: LDL-C Reduction

Early clinical trials of cholesterol (mostly LDL-C) reduction utilized niacin, bile acid sequestrants, and even the surgical approach of partial ileal bypass to reduce serum cholesterol levels. Although most of these early studies found a small but significant reduction in cardiac events, no decrease in total mortality was seen. The discovery of more potent and well-tolerated cholesterol-lowering agents, namely HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), ushered in a series of large cholesterol reduction trials that unequivocally established the benefit of cholesterol reduction. The first of these studies was the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) in which hypercholesterolemic men with CHD who were treated with simvastatin had a reduction in major coronary events of 44% and a reduction in total mortality of 30%. These impressive results were followed by additional studies using statins. The consistency of results of these studies is remarkable. They demonstrated statins to be effective in primary as well as secondary prevention, in women as well as men, in elderly as well as middle-aged individuals, and in patients with only modestly elevated LDL-C levels as well as those with severe hypercholesterolemia. In general, these studies demonstrated that a 1% reduction in LDL-C level is associated with a reduction in coronary events of a similar magnitude, and an 40 mg/dL reduction in LDL-C is associated with an 22% reduction in coronary events.

More recent studies have enrolled subjects with average or subaverage plasma LDL-C levels and have involved targeting the on-treatment LDL-C to even lower levels. For example, the Heart Protection Study (HPS) included 20,536 men and women, ages 40每80 years, who had either established ASCVD or were at high risk for the development of CHD (primarily diabetes); the only lipid entry criterion was a total plasma cholesterol level of >135 mg/dL. Treatment with simvastatin for an average of 5 years resulted in a 24% reduction in major coronary events and a highly significant 13% reduction in all-cause mortality. Importantly, the relative benefit of statin therapy was similar across tertiles of baseline LDL-C, and even the large subgroup of individuals with an LDL-C <100 mg/dL at baseline experienced significant benefit from therapy. This study demonstrated that statin therapy is beneficial in high-risk subjects, even if the baseline LDL-C level is below the currently recommended targeted goal; it also helped to shift the emphasis from simply treating elevated cholesterol to treating patients at high risk of CHD. Additional large-scale clinical trials have expanded on these findings and confirmed that individuals with other cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes) benefit from LDL-lowering therapy even when the initial LDL-C level is only modestly elevated. The JUPITER trial was a primary prevention trial in subjects without CHD and with LDL-C <130 mg/dL but with an elevated plasma level of C-reactive protein (CRP). Treatment with rosuvastatin reduced LDL-C by an average of 50% and significantly reduced cardiovascular events, further extending the indication for statin therapy in primary prevention.

Further studies have compared different statin regimens to show that greater reductions in LDL-C levels with treatment are associated with a greater reduction in major cardiovascular events. Based on several of these studies, a white paper was issued by the NCEP in 2004 establishing an "optional" LDL-C goal of <70 mg/dL in high-risk patients with CHD and of <100 mg/dL in very-high-risk patients without known CHD. These optional targets have been widely embraced, and clinical practice is clearly evolving to treating CHD and high-risk patients more aggressively for LDL reduction.

Clinical Trials: The Triglyceride-HDL Axis

Abnormalities of the triglyceride high-density lipoprotein (TG-HDL) axis are common in patients with CHD, although data supporting pharmacologic intervention in the TG-HDL axis is less compelling than data supporting LDL-C reduction. Fibric acid derivatives (fibrates), nicotinic acid (niacin), and omega 3 fatty acids (fish oils) are the primary agents currently available to lower plasma triglyceride levels and increase plasma levels of HDL-C. Fibrates have been used as lipid-lowering drugs for several decades and are more effective in reducing plasma triglyceride levels and relatively less effective in increasing plasma HDL-C levels. The results of clinical trials using fibrates have been mixed. Some studies such as the Helsinki Heart Study (HHS) and the Veteran Affairs High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Intervention Trial (VA-HIT) demonstrated a significant reduction in nonfatal myocardial infarction and coronary death with gemfibrozil therapy. However, the Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) trial of bezafibrate vs placebo in CHD patients with low HDL-C failed to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in coronary events, the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) trial of fenofibrate in patients with type 2 diabetes failed to show a significant reduction in its primary endpoint of nonfatal myocardial infarction and coronary death, and the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study of fenofibrate vs. placebo added to simvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes failed to show a significant reduction in its primary end point of major acute cardiovascular events. In each of these studies, the subgroup with elevated baseline triglycerides suggested benefit.

While niacin is the most effective HDL-raising drug currently available, it has not been tested for its ability to reduce cardiovascular risk in subjects with low plasma levels of HDL-C. The AIM-HIGH and HPS2-THRIVE trials are ongoing studies of the effect of niacin added to baseline statin therapy in patients with CHD and low HDL-C. Finally, while low-dose fish oils have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events, higher doses that reduce triglyceride levels have not been tested for their ability to reduce cardiovascular events. Definitive proof that treating the TG-HDL axis reduces cardiovascular events is likely to come from new therapies that are more effective at specifically targeting VLDL and/or HDL particles.

Clinical Approach to Lipid-Modifying Therapy

The major goal of lipid-modifying therapy in most patients with disorders of lipid metabolism is to prevent ASCVD and its complications. Management of lipid disorders should be based on clinical trial data demonstrating that treatment reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, although reasonable extrapolation of these data to specific subgroups is sometimes required. Clearly, elevated plasma levels of LDL-C are strongly associated with increased risk of ASCVD, and treatment to lower the levels of plasma LDL-C decreases the risk of clinical cardiovascular events in both secondary and primary prevention. Although the proportional benefit accrued from reducing plasma LDL-C appears to be similar over the entire range of LDL-C values, the absolute risk reduction depends on the baseline level of cardiovascular risk. The treatment guidelines developed by NCEP ATPIII and the 2004 white paper incorporate these principles. As noted above, abnormalities in the TG-HDL axis (elevated triglyceride, low HDL-C, or both) are commonly seen in patients with CHD or who are at high risk for developing it, but clinical trial data supporting the treatment of these abnormalities is much less compelling, and the pharmacologic tools for their management are more limited. Importantly, the NCEP ATPIII guidelines promote the use of the "non-HDL-C" as a secondary target of therapy in patients with triglyceride levels >200 mg/dL. The goals for non-HDL-C are 30 mg/dL higher than the goals for LDL-C. Thus, many patients with abnormalities of the TG-HDL axis require additional therapy for reduction of non-HDL-C to recommended goals.

Nonpharmacologic Treatment

Diet

Dietary modification is an important component in the management of dyslipidemia. The physician should assess the content of the patient's diet and provide suggestions for dietary modifications. In the patient with elevated LDL-C, dietary saturated fat and cholesterol should be restricted. For individuals with hypertriglyceridemia, the intake of simple carbohydrates should be curtailed. For severe hypertriglyceridemia (>1000 mg/dL), restriction of total fat intake is critical. The most widely used diet to lower the LDL-C level is the "Step I diet" developed by the American Heart Association. Most patients have a relatively modest (<10%) decrease in plasma levels of LDL-C on a Step I diet in the absence of any associated weight loss. Almost all persons experience a decrease in plasma HDL-C levels with a reduction in the amount of total and saturated fat in their diet.

Foods and Additives

Certain foods and dietary additives are associated with modest reductions in plasma cholesterol levels. Plant stanol and sterol esters are available in a variety of foods, such as spreads, salad dressings, and snack bars. Plant sterol and sterol esters interfere with cholesterol absorption and reduce plasma LDL-C levels by 10% when taken three times per day. The addition to the diet of psyllium, soy protein, or Chinese red yeast rice (which contains lovastatin) can have modest cholesterol-lowering effects. No controlled studies have been performed in which several of these nonpharmacologic options have been combined to address their additive or synergistic effects.

Weight Loss and Exercise

The treatment of obesity, if present, can have a favorable impact on plasma lipid levels and should be actively encouraged. Plasma triglyceride and LDL-C levels tend to fall and HDL-C levels tend to increase in obese subjects after weight reduction. Regular aerobic exercise can also have a positive effect on lipids, in large measure due to the associated weight reduction. Aerobic exercise has a very modest elevating effect on plasma levels of HDL-C in most individuals but also has cardiovascular benefits that extend beyond the effects on plasma lipid levels.

Pharmacologic Treatment

The decision to use drug therapy depends on the level of cardiovascular risk. Drug therapy for hypercholesterolemia in patients with established CHD is well supported by clinical trial data, as reviewed above. Even patients with CHD or risk factors who have "average" LDL-C levels benefit from treatment. Drug treatment to lower LDL-C levels in patients with CHD is also highly cost-effective. Patients with diabetes mellitus without known CHD have similar cardiovascular risk to those without diabetes but with preexisting CHD. The NCEP ATPIII guidelines recommended estimating absolute risk of a cardiovascular event over 10 years using a scoring system based on the Framingham Heart Study database. Patients with a 10-year absolute CHD risk of >20% are considered "CHD risk equivalents" to be treated as aggressively as patients with existing CHD. Current NCEP ATPIII guidelines call for drug therapy to reduce LDL-C to <100 mg/dL in patients with established CHD, other ASCVD (aortic aneurysm, peripheral vascular disease, or cerebrovascular disease), diabetes mellitus, or CHD risk equivalents; and "optionally" to reduce LDL-C to <70 mg/dL in high-risk CHD patients. Based on these guidelines, virtually all CHD and CHD risk-equivalent patients require cholesterol-lowering drug therapy. Moderate-risk patients with two or more risk factors and a 10-year absolute risk of 10每20% should be treated to a goal LDL-C of <130 mg/dL or "optionally" to LDL-C <100 mg/dL.

Although helpful to consider 10-year absolute risk in making clinical decisions about lipid-altering drug therapy, there are situations where 10-year risk is low but lifetime risk is very high and therefore treatment is indicated. A typical example would be a young adult with heterozygous FH and an LDL-C >220 mg/dL. Despite a very low 10-year absolute risk, every such patient should be treated with drug therapy to reduce lifetime risk. Indeed, all patients with markedly elevated plasma levels of LDL-C levels (>190 mg/dL) should be strongly considered for drug therapy even if their 10-year absolute CHD risk is not elevated. The decision of whether to initiate drug treatment in individuals with plasma LDL-C levels between 130 and 190 mg/dL remains controversial and depends on both 10-year and lifetime risk. Although it is desirable to avoid drug treatment in patients who are unlikely to develop CHD, a high proportion of patients who eventually develop CHD have plasma LDL-C levels within this range. The presence of other risk factors such as a low plasma level of HDL-C (<40 mg/dL) or the diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome would argue in favor of drug therapy (Chap. 242). Other laboratory tests such as an elevated plasma level of apoB, Lp(a), or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, may assist in the identification of high-risk individuals who should be considered for drug therapy when their LDL-C is in a "gray zone."

Drug treatment is also indicated in patients with triglycerides >500 mg/dL who have been screened and treated for secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia. The goal is to reduce fasting plasma triglycerides to below 500 mg/dL to prevent the risk of acute pancreatitis. When triglycerides are 200每500 mg/dL, the decision to use drug therapy depends on the risk of the patient developing chylomicronemia and an assessment of cardiovascular risk. Most major clinical endpoint trials with statins have excluded persons with triglyceride levels >350每450 mg/dL, and there are therefore few data regarding the effectiveness of statins in reducing cardiovascular risk in persons with hypertriglyceridemia. More data are needed regarding the relative effectiveness of statins, fibrates, niacin, and fish oils for reducing cardiovascular risk in this setting. Combination therapy is often required for optimal control of mixed dyslipidemia.

HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins)

HMG-CoA reductase is a key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, and inhibition of this enzyme decreases cholesterol synthesis. By inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis, statins lead to increased hepatic LDL receptor activity as a counterregulatory mechanism and thus accelerated clearance of circulating LDL, resulting in a dose-dependent reduction in plasma levels of LDL-C. The magnitude of LDL lowering associated with statin treatment varies widely among individuals, but once a patient is on a statin, the doubling of the statin dose produces an 6% further reduction in the level of plasma LDL-C. The statins currently available differ in their LDL-C reducing potency (Table 356-6). Currently, there is no convincing evidence that any of the different statins confer an advantage that is independent of the effect on LDL-C. Statins also reduce plasma triglycerides in a dose-dependent fashion, which is roughly proportional to their LDL-C每lowering effects (if the triglycerides are <400 mg/dL). Statins have a modest HDL-raising effect (5每10%) that is not generally dose-dependent.

Statins are well tolerated and can be taken in tablet form once a day. Potential side effects include dyspepsia, headaches, fatigue, and muscle or joint pains. Severe myopathy and even rhabdomyolysis occur rarely with statin treatment. The risk of statin-associated myopathy is increased by the presence of older age, frailty, renal insufficiency, and coadministration of drugs that interfere with the metabolism of statins such as erythromycin and related antibiotics, antifungal agents, immunosuppressive drugs, and fibric acid derivatives (particularly gemfibrozil). Severe myopathy can usually be avoided by careful patient selection, avoidance of interacting drugs, and instructing the patient to contact the physician immediately in the event of unexplained muscle pain. In the event of muscle symptoms, the plasma creatine kinase (CK) level should be obtained to document the myopathy. Serum CK levels need not be monitored on a routine basis in patients taking statins, as an elevated CK in the absence of symptoms does not predict the development of myopathy and does not necessarily suggest the need for discontinuing the drug.

Another consequence of statin therapy can be elevation in liver transaminases [alanine (ALT) and aspartate (AST)]. They should be checked before starting therapy, at 2每3 months, and then annually. Substantial (greater than three times the upper limit of normal) elevation in transaminases is relatively rare and mild-to-moderate (one to three times normal) elevation in transaminases in the absence of symptoms need not mandate discontinuing the medication. Severe clinical hepatitis associated with statins is exceedingly rare, and the trend is toward less frequent monitoring of transaminases in patients taking statins. The statin-associated elevation in liver enzymes resolves upon discontinuation of the medication.

Statins appear to be remarkably safe. Meta-analyses of large randomized controlled clinical trials with statins do not suggest an increase in any major noncardiac diseases. Statins are the drug class of choice for LDL-C reduction and are by far the most widely used class of lipid-lowering drugs.

Cholesterol Absorption Inhibitors

Cholesterol within the lumen of the small intestine is derived from the diet (about one-third) and the bile (about two-thirds) and is actively absorbed by the enterocyte through a process that involves the protein NPC1L1. Ezetimibe (Table 356-6) is a cholesterol absorption inhibitor that binds directly to and inhibits NPC1L1 and blocks the intestinal absorption of cholesterol. Ezetimibe (10 mg) inhibits cholesterol absorption by almost 60%, resulting in a reduction in delivery of dietary sterols in the liver and an increase in hepatic LDL receptor expression. The mean reduction in plasma LDL-C on ezetimibe (10 mg) is 18%, and the effect is additive when used in combination with a statin. Effects on triglyceride and HDL-C levels are negligible, and no cardiovascular outcome data have been reported. When used in combination with a statin, monitoring of liver transaminases is recommended. The only role for ezetimibe in monotherapy is in patients who do not tolerate statins; the drug is often added to a statin in patients who require further LDL-C reduction.

Bile Acid Sequestrants (Resins)

Bile acid sequestrants bind bile acids in the intestine and promote their excretion rather than reabsorption in the ileum. To maintain the bile acid pool size, the liver diverts cholesterol to bile acid synthesis. The decreased hepatic intracellular cholesterol content results in upregulation of the LDL receptor and enhanced LDL clearance from the plasma. Bile acid sequestrants, including cholestyramine, colestipol, and colesevelam (Table 356-6), primarily reduce plasma LDL-C levels but can cause an increase in plasma triglycerides. Therefore, patients with hypertriglyceridemia should not be treated with bile acid每binding resins. Cholestyramine and colestipol are insoluble resins that must be suspended in liquids. Colesevelam is available as tablets but generally requires up to six to seven tablets per day for effective LDL-C lowering. Most side effects of resins are limited to the gastrointestinal tract and include bloating and constipation. Since bile acid sequestrants are not systemically absorbed, they are very safe and the cholesterol-lowering drug of choice in children and in women of childbearing age who are lactating, pregnant, or could become pregnant. They are effective in combination with statins as well as in combination with ezetimibe and are particularly useful with one or both of these drugs for difficult-to-treat patients or those with statin intolerance.

Nicotinic Acid (Niacin)

Nicotinic acid, or niacin, is a B-complex vitamin that has been used as a lipid-modifying agent for more than five decades. Niacin reduces the flux of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) to the liver, which is thought to be the mechanism for reduced hepatic triglyceride synthesis and VLDL secretion. Recently, a nicotinic acid receptor (GPR109A) was discovered that suppresses release of NEFA by adipose tissue, thus mediating the effect of niacin on NEFA suppression. Niacin reduces plasma triglyceride and LDL-C levels and raises the plasma concentration of HDL-C (Table 356-6), but it appears that these effects may not be mediated solely by GPR109A. Niacin is also the only currently available lipid-lowering drug that significantly reduces plasma levels of Lp(a) (up to 40%). If properly prescribed and monitored, niacin is a safe and effective lipid-lowering agent.

The most frequent side effect of niacin is cutaneous flushing, which is mediated by activating GPR109A in the skin, leading to local generation of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and prostaglandin E2. Flushing can be reduced by formulations that slow the absorption and by taking aspirin prior to dosing. A product is available in Europe that blocks the receptor for PGD2 and attenuates flushing. There is rapid tachyphylaxis to the flushing. Niacin therapy is generally started at lower doses and gradually titrated up to higher doses. Immediate-release crystalline niacin is generally administered three times per day, over-the-counter sustained-release niacin is taken twice a day, and a prescription form of extended-release niacin is taken once a day. Mild elevations in transaminases occur in up to 15% of patients treated with any form of niacin, and on occasion these elevations may require stopping the medication. Niacin potentiates the effect of warfarin, and these two drugs should be prescribed together with caution. Acanthosis nigricans, a dark-colored coarse skin lesion, and maculopathy are infrequent side effects of niacin. Niacin is contraindicated in patients with peptic ulcer disease and can exacerbate the symptoms of esophageal reflux. It can also raise plasma levels of uric acid and precipitate gouty attacks in susceptible patients.

Niacin can raise fasting plasma glucose levels. A study in type 2 diabetics found only a slight increase in fasting glucose and no significant change in HbA1c level with niacin treatment. Low-dose niacin can be used effectively to reduce plasma triglyceride levels and increase HDL-C without adversely impacting on glycemic control. Thus, niacin can be used in diabetic patients, but every effort should be made to optimize the diabetes management before initiating niacin. Glucose should be carefully monitored in nondiabetic patients with impaired fasting glucose after initiation of niacin therapy.

Successful therapy with niacin requires careful education and motivation on the part of the patient. Its advantages are its low cost and long-term safety. It is the most effective drug currently available for raising HDL-C levels. It is particularly useful in patients with combined hyperlipidemia and low plasma levels of HDL-C and is effective in combination with statins. Outcome data are somewhat limited with niacin, but two clinical trials assessing the benefits of adding niacin to a statin in high-risk patients with low HDL-C are currently ongoing.

Fibric Acid Derivatives (Fibrates)

Fibric acid derivatives are agonists of PPARa, a nuclear receptor involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism. Fibrates stimulate LPL activity (enhancing triglyceride hydrolysis), reduce apoC-III synthesis (enhancing lipoprotein remnant clearance), promote beta-oxidation of fatty acids, and may reduce VLDL triglyceride production. Fibrates are the most effective drugs available for reducing triglyceride levels and also raise HDL-C levels modestly (Table 356-6). They have variable effects on LDL-C and in hypertriglyceridemic patients can sometimes be associated with increases in plasma LDL-C levels.

Fibrates are generally very well tolerated. The most common side effect is dyspepsia. Myopathy and hepatitis occur rarely in the absence of other lipid-lowering agents. Fibrates promote cholesterol secretion into bile and are associated with an increased risk of gallstones. Fibrates can raise creatinine and should be used with caution in patients with chronic kidney disease. Importantly, fibrates can potentiate the effect of warfarin and certain oral hypoglycemic agents, so the anticoagulation status and plasma glucose levels should be closely monitored in patients on these agents.

Fibrates are useful and are a reasonable consideration for first-line therapy in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (>500 mg/dL) to prevent pancreatitis. Their role in patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia (200每500 mg/dL) is to promote reduction in non-HDL-C levels, but outcome data regarding their effects on coronary events in this setting remains mixed. In patients with a triglyceride level <500 mg/dL, the role of fibrates is primarily in combination with statins in selected patients with mixed dyslipidemia. In this setting, the risk of myopathy can be minimized with appropriate patient and drug selection and must be carefully weighed against the clinical benefit of the therapy.

Omega 3 Fatty Acids (Fish Oils)

N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) are present in high concentration in fish and in flaxseeds. The most widely used n-3 PUFAs for the treatment of hyperlipidemias are the two active molecules in fish oil: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and decohexanoic acid (DHA). N-3 PUFAs have been concentrated into tablets and in doses of 3每4 g/d are effective at lowering fasting triglyceride levels. Fish oils can cause an increase in plasma LDL-C levels in some patients. Fish oil supplements can be used in combination with fibrates, niacin, or statins to treat hypertriglyceridemia. In general, fish oils are well tolerated and appear to be safe, at least at doses up to 3每4 g. Although fish oil administration is associated with a prolongation in the bleeding time, no increase in bleeding has been seen in clinical trials. A lower dose of omega 3 (about 1 g) has been associated with reduction in cardiovascular events in CHD patients and is used by some clinicians for this purpose.

Combination Drug Therapy

Combination drug therapy is frequently used for (1) patients unable to reach LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals on statin monotherapy, (2) patients with combined elevated LDL-C and abnormalities of the TG-HDL axis, and (3) patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia who do not achieve non-HDL-C goal on a fibrate or on fish oils alone. When LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals are not achieved on statin monotherapy, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor or bile acid sequestrant can be added to the drug regimen. Combination of niacin with a statin is an attractive option for high-risk patients who do not attain their target LDL-C level on statin monotherapy and have a low HDL-C level. Conversely, in high-risk patients on statin therapy who have an elevated plasma triglyceride level, addition of a fibrate or fish oils is a reasonable consideration.

Severely hypertriglyceridemic patients treated first with a fibrate often fail to reach LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals and are therefore candidates for addition of a statin. Coadministration of statins and fibrates has obvious appeal in patients with combined hyperlipidemia, but no clinical trial has assessed the effectiveness of a statin-fibrate combination compared with either a statin or a fibrate alone in reducing cardiovascular events. The long-term safety of the statin-fibrate combination is not known. Since coadministration of statins and fibrates is associated with an increased incidence of severe myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, patients treated with this combination must be carefully counseled and monitored. This combination of drugs should be used cautiously in patients with underlying renal or hepatic insufficiency; in the elderly, frail, and chronically ill; and in those on multiple medications.

Other Approaches

Occasionally, patients cannot tolerate any of the existing lipid-lowering drugs at doses required for adequate control of their lipid levels. A larger group of patients, most of whom have genetic lipid disorders, remain significantly hypercholesterolemic despite combination drug therapy. These patients are at high risk for the development or progression of CHD and clinical CHD events. The preferred option for management of patients with severe refractory hypercholesterolemia is LDL apheresis. In this process, the patient's plasma is passed over a column that selectively removes the LDL, and the LDL-depleted plasma is returned to the patient. Patients on maximally tolerated combination drug therapy who have CHD and a plasma LDL-C level >200 mg/dL or no CHD and a plasma LDL-C level >300 mg/dL are candidates for every-other-week LDL apheresis and should be referred to a specialized lipid center.

Management of Low HDL-C

Severely reduced plasma levels of HDL-C (<20 mg/dL) accompanied by triglycerides <400 mg/dL usually indicate the presence of a genetic disorder such as a mutation in apoA-I, LCAT deficiency, or Tangier disease. HDL-C levels <20 mg/dL are common in the setting of severe hypertriglyceridemia, in which case the primary focus should be on the management of the triglycerides. HDL-C levels <20 mg/dL also occur in individuals using anabolic steroids. Secondary causes of more moderate reductions in plasma HDL (20每40 mg/dL) should be considered (Table 356-5). Smoking should be discontinued, obese persons should be encouraged to lose weight, sedentary persons should be encouraged to exercise, and diabetes should be optimally controlled. When possible, medications associated with reduced plasma levels of HDL-C should be discontinued. The presence of an isolated low plasma level of HDL-C in a patient with a borderline plasma level of LDL-C should prompt consideration of LDL-lowering drug therapy in high-risk individuals. Statins increase plasma levels of HDL-C only modestly (5每10%). Fibrates also have only a modest effect on plasma HDL-C levels (increasing levels 5每15%), except in patients with coexisting hypertriglyceridemia, where the effect on HDL levels can be greater. Niacin is the most effective HDL-C每raising therapeutic agent available and can increase plasma HDL-C by up to 30%, although some patients fail to achieve clinically important increases in HDL-C levels from niacin therapy.

The issue of whether pharmacologic intervention should be used to specifically raise HDL-C levels has not been adequately addressed in clinical trials. In persons with established CHD and low HDL-C levels whose plasma LDL-C levels are at or below the goal, it may be reasonable to initiate therapy (with a fibrate or niacin) directed specifically at reducing plasma triglyceride levels and raising the level of plasma HDL-C. More data are required before broad recommendations are made to use drug therapy to specifically raise HDL-C levels to prevent cardiovascular events. New HDL-raising approaches are under development that may help to address this important issue.

Management of Elevated Levels of LP(a)

High levels of Lp(a) are associated with increased risk of ASCVD. Genetic studies suggest that this association is causal, but there is no evidence that reducing plasma Lp(a) levels reduces cardiovascular risk. Until such studies are performed, the major therapeutic approach to patients with high plasma levels of Lp(a) and established CAD is to aggressively lower plasma levels of LDL-C. Niacin is the only drug currently available that lowers Lp(a), and might be considered as an addition to a statin in a very-high-risk patient with elevated Lp(a).

Chapter 357. Hemochromatosis >
 

Hemochromatosis: Introduction

Definition

Hemochromatosis is a common inherited disorder of iron metabolism in which dysregulation of intestinal iron absorption results in deposition of excessive amounts of iron in parenchymal cells with eventual tissue damage and impaired function in a wide range of organs. The iron-storage pigment in tissues is called hemosiderin because it is believed to be derived from the blood. The term hemosiderosis is used to describe the presence of stainable iron in tissues, but tissue iron must be quantified to assess body-iron status accurately (see below and Chap. 103). Hemochromatosis refers to a group of genetic diseases that predispose to iron overload, potentially leading to fibrosis and organ failure. Cirrhosis of the liver, diabetes mellitus, arthritis, cardiomyopathy, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism are the major clinical manifestations.

Although there is debate about definitions, the following terminology is widely accepted.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is most often caused by a mutant gene, termed HFE, which is tightly linked to the HLA-A locus on chromosome 6p (see "Genetic Basis," below). Persons who are homozygous for the mutation are at increased risk of iron overload and account for 80 to 90% of clinical hereditary hemochromatosis in persons of northern European descent. In such subjects, the presence of hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, arthropathy, or hepatocellular carcinoma constitutes iron overload每related disease. Rarer forms of non-HFE hemochromatosis are caused by mutations in other genes involved in iron metabolism (Table 357-1). The disease can be recognized during its early stages when iron overload and organ damage are minimal. At this stage, the disease is best referred to as earlyhemochromatosis or precirrhotic hemochromatosis.

Secondary iron overload occurs as a result of an iron-loading anemia, such as thalassemia or sideroblastic anemia, in which erythropoiesis is increased but ineffective. In the acquired iron-loading disorders, massive iron deposits in parenchymal tissues can lead to the same clinical and pathologic features as in hemochromatosis.

Prevalence

HFE-associated hemochromatosis mutations are among the most common inherited disease alleles, although the prevalence varies in different ethnic groups. It is most common in populations of northern European extraction in whom approximately 1 in 10 persons are heterozygous carriers and 0.3每0.5% are homozygotes. However, expression of the disease is variable and modified by several factors, especially alcohol consumption and dietary iron intake, blood loss associated with menstruation and pregnancy, and blood donation. Recent population studies indicate that approximately 30% of homozygous men develop iron overload每related disease and about 6% develop hepatic cirrhosis; for women, the figure is closer to 1%. Nearly 70% of patients develop the first symptoms between ages 40 and 60. The disease is rarely evident before age 20, although with family screening (see "Screening for Hemochromatosis," below) and periodic health examinations, asymptomatic subjects with iron overload can be identified, including young menstruating women.

In contrast to HFE-associated hemochromatosis, the non-HFE-associated forms of hemochromatosis (Table 357-1) are rare, but they affect all races and young people (juvenile hemochromatosis).

Genetic Basis

The HFE gene responsible for the most common form of hemochromatosis was identified in 1996. A homozygous G to A mutation resulting in a cysteine to tyrosine substitution at position 282 (C282Y) is the most common mutation. It is identified in 85每90% of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis in populations of northern European descent but is found in only 60% of cases from Mediterranean populations (e.g., southern Italy). A second, relatively common HFE mutation (H63D) results in a substitution of histidine to aspartic acid at codon 63. Homozygosity for H63D is not associated with clinically significant iron overload. Some compound heterozygotes (e.g., one copy each of C282Y and H63D) have mild to moderately increased body-iron stores but develop clinical disease only in association with cofactors such as heavy alcohol intake or hepatic steatosis. Thus, HFE-associated hemochromatosis is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait; heterozygotes have no, or minimal, increase in iron stores. However, this slight increase in hepatic iron can act as a cofactor that may modify the expression of other diseases such as porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

Mutations in other genes involved in iron metabolism are responsible for non-HFE-associated hemochromatosis, including juvenile hemochromatosis, which affects persons in the second and third decades of life (Table 357-1). Mutations in the genes encoding hepcidin, transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2), and hemojuvelin (Fig. 357-1) result in clinicopathologic features that are indistinguishable from HFE-associated hemochromatosis. However, mutations in ferroportin, responsible for the efflux of iron from enterocytes and most other cell types, result in iron loading of reticuloendothelial cells and macrophages as well as parenchymal cells.

Pathways of normaliron homeostasis. Dietary inorganic iron traverses the brush border membrane of duodenal enterocytes via DMT1 after reduction of ferric (Fe3+) iron to the ferrous (Fe2+) state by duodenal cytochrome B (DcytB). Iron then moves from the enterocyte to the circulation via a process requiring the basolateral iron exporter ferroportin (FPN) and the iron oxidase hephaestin (Heph). In the circulation, iron binds to plasma transferrin and is thereby distributed to sites of iron utilization and storage. Much of the diferric transferrin supplies iron to immature erythrocyte cells in the bone marrow for hemoglobin synthesis. At the end of their life, senescent red blood cells (RBC) are phagocytosed by macrophages and iron is returned to the circulation after export through ferroportin. The liver-derived peptide hepcidin represses basolateral iron transport in the gut as well as iron released from macrophages and other cells and serves as a central regulator of body-iron traffic. Hepcidin responds to changes in body-iron requirements by signals mediated by diferric transferrin through two mechanisms. One involves HFE and TfR2, while the other involves hemojuvelin (HJV) and the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)/SMAD pathway. Haem is metabolized by heme oxygenase within the enterocytes and the released iron then follows the same pathway.

Mutations in the genes encoding HFE, TfR2, hemojuvelin and hepcidin all lead to decreased hepcidin release and increased iron absorption, resulting in hemochromatosis (Table 357-1).
 
 

Pathophysiology

Normally, the body-iron content of 3每4 g is maintained such that intestinal mucosal absorption of iron is equal to iron loss. This amount is approximately 1 mg/d in men and 1.5 mg/d in menstruating women. In hemochromatosis, mucosal absorption is greater than body requirements and amounts to 4 mg/d or more. The progressive accumulation of iron increases plasma iron, saturation of transferrin, and results in a progressive increase of plasma ferritin (Fig. 357-2). A liver-derived peptide, hepcidin, represses basolateral iron transport in the intestine and iron release from macrophages and other cells by binding to ferroportin. Hepcidin, in turn, responds to signals in the liver mediated by HFE, TfR2, and hemojuvelin (Fig. 357-1). Thus, hepcidin is a crucial molecule in iron metabolism, linking body stores with intestinal iron absorption.

The HFE gene encodes a 343-amino-acid protein that is structurally related to MHC class I proteins. The basic defect in HFE-associated hemochromatosis is a lack of cell surface expression of HFE (due to the C282Y mutation). The normal (wild-type) HFE protein forms a complex with b2-microglobulin and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1). The C282Y mutation completely abrogates this interaction. As a result, the mutant HFE protein remains trapped intracellularly, reducing TfR1-mediated iron uptake by the intestinal crypt cell. This impaired TfR1-mediated iron uptake leads to upregulation of the divalent metal transporter (DMT1) on the brush border of the villus cells, causing inappropriately increased intestinal iron absorption (Fig. 357-1). In advanced disease, the body may contain 20 g or more of iron that is deposited mainly in parenchymal cells of the liver, pancreas, and heart. Iron may be increased 50- to 100-fold in the liver and pancreas and 5- to 25-fold in the heart. Iron deposition in the pituitary causes hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in both men and women. Tissue injury may result from disruption of iron-laden lysosomes, from lipid peroxidation of subcellular organelles by excess iron, or from stimulation of collagen synthesis by activated stellate cells.

Secondary iron overload with deposition in parenchymal cells occurs in chronic disorders of erythropoiesis, particularly in those due to defects in hemoglobin synthesis or ineffective erythropoiesis such as sideroblastic anemia and thalassemia (Chap. 104). In these disorders, iron absorption is increased. Moreover, these patients require blood transfusions and are frequently treated inappropriately with iron. PCT, a disorder characterized by a defect in porphyrin biosynthesis (Chap. 358), can also be associated with excessive parenchymal iron deposits. The magnitude of the iron load in PCT is usually insufficient to produce tissue damage. However, some patients with PCT also have mutations in the HFE gene, and some have associated hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Although the relationship between these disorders remains to be clarified, iron overload accentuates the inherited enzyme deficiency in PCT and should be avoided along with other agents (alcohol, estrogens, haloaromatic compounds) that may exacerbate PCT. Another cause of hepatic parenchymal iron overload is hereditary aceruloplasminemia. In this disorder, impairment of iron mobilization due to deficiency of ceruloplasmin (a ferroxidase) causes iron overload in hepatocytes.

Excessive iron ingestion over many years rarely results in hemochromatosis. An important exception has been reported in South Africa among groups who brew fermented beverages in vessels made of iron. Hemochromatosis has been described in apparently normal persons who have taken medicinal iron over many years, but such individuals probably had genetic disorders.

The common denominator in all patients with hemochromatosis is excessive amounts of iron in parenchymal tissues. Parenteral administration of iron in the form of blood transfusions or iron preparations results predominantly in reticuloendothelial cell iron overload. This appears to lead to less tissue damage than iron loading of parenchymal cells.

In the liver, parenchymal iron is in the form of ferritin and hemosiderin. In the early stages, these deposits are seen in the periportal parenchymal cells, especially within lysosomes in the pericanalicular cytoplasm of the hepatocytes. This stage progresses to perilobular fibrosis and eventually to deposition of iron in bile-duct epithelium, Kupffer cells, and fibrous septa due to activation of stellate cells. In the advanced stage, a macronodular or mixed macro- and micronodular cirrhosis develops. Hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis correlate significantly with hepatic iron concentration.

At autopsy, the enlarged nodular liver and pancreas are rusty in color. Histologically, iron is increased in many organs, particularly in the liver, heart, and pancreas, and, to a lesser extent, in the endocrine glands. The epidermis of the skin is thin, and melanin is increased in the cells of the basal layer and dermis. Deposits of iron are present around the synovial lining cells of the joints.

Clinical Manifestations

C282Y homozygotes can be characterized by the stage of progression as follows: (1) a genetic predisposition without abnormalities; (2) iron overload without symptoms; (3) iron overload with symptoms (e.g., arthritis and fatigue); and (4) iron overload with organ damage〞in particular, cirrhosis. Thus, many subjects with significant iron overload are asymptomatic. For example, in a study of 672 asymptomatic C282Y homozygous subjects〞identified by either family screening or routine health examinations〞there was hepatic iron overload (grades 2每4) in 56% and 34.5% of male and female subjects, respectively; hepatic fibrosis (stages 2每4) in 18.4% and 5.4%, respectively; and cirrhosis in 5.6% and 1.9%, respectively.

Initial symptoms are often nonspecific and include lethargy, arthralgia, change in skin color, loss of libido, and features of diabetes mellitus. Hepatomegaly, increased pigmentation, spider angiomas, splenomegaly, arthropathy, ascites, cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, loss of body hair, testicular atrophy, and jaundice are prominent in advanced disease.

The liver is usually the first organ to be affected, and hepatomegaly is present in more than 95% of symptomatic patients. Hepatic enlargement may exist in the absence of symptoms or of abnormal liver-function tests. Manifestations of portal hypertension and esophageal varices occur less commonly than in cirrhosis from other causes. Hepatocellular carcinoma develops in about 30% of patients with cirrhosis, and it is the most common cause of death in treated patients〞hence the importance of early diagnosis and therapy. The incidence increases with age, it is more common in men, and it occurs almost exclusively in cirrhotic patients.

Excessive skin pigmentation is present in patients with advanced disease. The characteristic metallic or slate-gray hue is sometimes referred to as bronzing and results from increased melanin and iron in the dermis. Pigmentation usually is diffuse and generalized, but it may be more pronounced on the face, neck, extensor aspects of the lower forearms, dorsa of the hands, lower legs, and genital regions, as well as in scars.

Diabetes mellitus occurs in about 65% of patients with advanced disease and is more likely to develop in those with a family history of diabetes, suggesting that direct damage to the pancreatic islets by iron deposition occurs in combination with other risk factors. The management is similar to that of other forms of diabetes, although insulin resistance is more common in association with hemochromatosis. Late complications are the same as seen in other causes of diabetes mellitus.

Arthropathy develops in 25每50% of symptomatic patients. It usually occurs after age 50 but may occur as a first manifestation, or long after therapy. The joints of the hands, especially the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints, are usually the first joints involved, a feature that helps to distinguish the chondrocalcinosis associated with hemochromatosis from the idiopathic form (Chap. 333). A progressive polyarthritis involving wrists, hips, ankles, and knees may also ensue. Acute brief attacks of synovitis may be associated with deposition of calcium pyrophosphate (chondrocalcinosis or pseudogout), mainly in the knees. Radiologic manifestations include cystic changes of the subchondral bones, loss of articular cartilage with narrowing of the joint space, diffuse demineralization, hypertrophic bone proliferation, and calcification of the synovium. The arthropathy tends to progress despite removal of iron by phlebotomy. Although the relation of these abnormalities to iron metabolism is not known, the fact that similar changes occur in other forms of iron overload suggests that iron is directly involved.

Cardiac involvement is the presenting manifestation in about 15% of symptomatic patients. The most common manifestation is congestive heart failure, which occurs in about 10% of young adults with the disease, especially those with juvenile hemochromatosis. Symptoms of congestive heart failure may develop suddenly, with rapid progression to death if untreated. The heart is diffusely enlarged; this may be misdiagnosed as idiopathic cardiomyopathy if other overt manifestations are absent. Cardiac arrhythmias include premature supraventricular beats, paroxysmal tachyarrhythmias, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and varying degrees of atrioventricular block.

Hypogonadism occurs in both sexes and may antedate other clinical features. Manifestations include loss of libido, impotence, amenorrhea, testicular atrophy, gynecomastia, and sparse body hair. These changes are primarily the result of decreased production of gonadotropins due to impairment of hypothalamic-pituitary function by iron deposition. Adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism are rare manifestations.
 
Diagnosis

The association of (1) hepatomegaly, (2) skin pigmentation, (3) diabetes mellitus, (4) heart disease, (5) arthritis, and (6) hypogonadism should suggest the diagnosis. However, as stated above, significant iron overload may exist with none or only some of these manifestations. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is needed to make the diagnosis early. Treatment before permanent organ damage occurs can reverse the iron toxicity and restore life expectancy to normal.

The history should be particularly detailed in regard to disease in other family members; alcohol ingestion; iron intake; and ingestion of large doses of ascorbic acid, which promotes iron absorption (Chap. 74). Appropriate tests should be performed to exclude iron deposition due to hematologic disease. The presence of liver, pancreatic, cardiac, and joint disease should be confirmed by physical examination, radiography, and standard function tests of these organs.

The degree of increase in total body每iron stores can be assessed by (1) measurement of serum iron and the percent saturation of transferrin (or the unsaturated iron-binding capacity), (2) measurement of serum ferritin concentration, (3) liver biopsy with measurement of the iron concentration and calculation of the hepatic iron index (Table 357-2), and (4) MRI of the liver. In addition, a retrospective assessment of body-iron storage is also provided by performing weekly phlebotomy and calculating the amount of iron removed before iron stores are exhausted (1 mL blood = approximately 0.5 mg iron).

Each of these methods for assessing iron stores has advantages and limitations. The serum iron level and percent saturation of transferrin are elevated early in the course, but their specificity is reduced by significant false-positive and false-negative rates. For example, serum iron concentration may be increased in patients with alcoholic liver disease without iron overload; in this situation, however, the hepatic iron index is usually not increased as in hemochromatosis (Table 357-1). In otherwise healthy persons, a fasting serum transferrin saturation greater than 50% is abnormal and suggests homozygosity for hemochromatosis.

The serum ferritin concentration is usually a good index of body-iron stores, whether decreased or increased. In fact, an increase of 1 mg/L in serum ferritin level reflects an increase of about 5 mg in body stores. In most untreated patients with hemochromatosis, the serum ferritin level is significantly increased (Fig. 357-2 and Table 357-1), and a serum ferritin level >1000 mg/L is the strongest predictor of disease expression among individuals homozygous for the C282Y mutation. However, in patients with inflammation and hepatocellular necrosis, serum ferritin levels may be elevated out of proportion to body-iron stores due to increased release from tissues. Therefore, a repeat determination of serum ferritin should be carried out after acute hepatocellular damage has subsided (e.g., in alcoholic liver disease). Ordinarily, the combined measurements of the percent transferrin saturation and serum ferritin level provide a simple and reliable screening test for hemochromatosis, including the precirrhotic phase of the disease. If either of these tests is abnormal, genetic testing for hemochromatosis should be performed (Fig. 357-3).

The role of liver biopsy in the diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis has been reassessed as a result of the widespread availability of genetic testing for the C282Y mutation. The absence of severe fibrosis can be accurately predicted in most patients using clinical and biochemical variables. Thus, there is virtually no risk of severe fibrosis in a C282Y homozygous subject with (1) serum ferritin level less than 1000 mg/L, (2) normal serum alanine amino transaminase values, (3) no hepatomegaly, and (4) no excess alcohol intake. However, it should be emphasized that liver biopsy is the only reliable method for establishing or excluding the presence of hepatic cirrhosis, which is the critical factor determining prognosis and the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Biopsy also permits histochemical estimation of tissue iron and measurement of hepatic iron concentration. Increased density of the liver due to iron deposition can be demonstrated by CT or MRI, and, with improved technology, MRI has become more accurate in determining hepatic iron concentration.

Screening for Hemochromatosis

When the diagnosis of hemochromatosis is established, it is important to counsel and screen other family members (Chap. 63). Asymptomatic as well as symptomatic family members with the disease usually have an increased saturation of transferrin and an increased serum-ferritin concentration. These changes occur even before the iron stores are greatly increased (Fig. 357-2). All adult first-degree relatives of patients with hemochromatosis should be tested for the C282Y and H63D mutations and counseled appropriately (Fig. 357-3). In affected individuals, it is important to confirm or exclude the presence of cirrhosis and begin therapy as early as possible. When children of a proband are affected, a homozygote-heterozygote mating is most likely. For practical purposes, children need not be checked before they are 18 years old.

The role of population screening for hemochromatosis is controversial. Recent studies indicate that it is highly effective for primary care physicians to screen subjects using serum iron, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin levels. Such screening also detects iron deficiency. Genetic screening of the normal population is feasible, but its cost-effectiveness has not been established.

Treatment: Hemochromatosis

The therapy of hemochromatosis involves removal of the excess body iron and supportive treatment of damaged organs. Iron removal is best accomplished by weekly or twice-weekly phlebotomy of 500 mL. Although there is an initial modest decline in the volume of packed red blood cells to about 35 mL/dL, the level stabilizes after several weeks. The plasma transferrin saturation remains increased until the available iron stores are depleted. In contrast, the plasma ferritin concentration falls progressively, reflecting the gradual decrease in body-iron stores. One 500 mL unit of blood contains 200每250 mg iron, and up to 25 g iron or more may have to be removed. Therefore, in patients with advanced disease, weekly phlebotomy may be required for 1每2 years, and it should be continued until the serum ferritin level is under 50 mg/L. Thereafter, phlebotomies are performed at appropriate intervals to maintain ferritin levels between 50 and 100 mg/L. Usually one phlebotomy every three months will suffice.

Chelating agents such as deferoxamine, when given parenterally, remove 10每20 mg iron per day, which is much less than that mobilized by once-weekly phlebotomy. Phlebotomy is also less expensive, more convenient, and safer for most patients. However, chelating agents are indicated when anemia or hypoproteinemia is severe enough to preclude phlebotomy. Subcutaneous infusion of deferoxamine using a portable pump is the most effective means of its administration.

An effective oral ironchelating agent, deferasirox (Exjade), has recently become available but is still in clinical trials. This agent is effective in thalassemia and secondary iron overload, but its role in primary iron overload has yet to be established.

Alcohol consumption should be severely curtailed or eliminated because it increases the risk of cirrhosis in hereditary hemochromatosis nearly tenfold. The management of hepatic failure, cardiac failure, and diabetes mellitus is similar to conventional therapy for these conditions. Loss of libido and change in secondary sex characteristics are managed with testosterone replacement or gonadotropin therapy (Chap. 346).

End-stage liver disease may be an indication for liver transplantation, although results are improved if the excess iron can be removed beforehand. The available evidence indicates that the fundamental metabolic abnormality in hemochromatosis is reversed by successful liver transplantation.

Prognosis

The principal causes of death are cardiac failure, hepatocellular failure or portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Life expectancy is improved by removal of the excessive stores of iron and maintenance of these stores at near-normal levels. The 5-year survival rate with therapy increases from 33 to 89%. With repeated phlebotomy, the liver decreases in size, liver function improves, pigmentation of skin decreases, and cardiac failure may be reversed. Diabetes improves in about 40% of patients, but removal of excess iron has little effect on hypogonadism or arthropathy. Hepatic fibrosis may decrease, but established cirrhosis is irreversible. Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs as a late sequela in patients who are cirrhotic at presentation. The apparent increase in its incidence in treated patients is probably related to their increased life span. Hepatocellular carcinoma rarely develops if the disease is treated in the precirrhotic stage. Indeed, the life expectancy of homozygotes treated before the development of cirrhosis is normal.

The importance of family screening and early diagnosis and treatment cannot be overemphasized. Asymptomatic individuals detected by family studies should have phlebotomy therapy if iron stores are moderately to severely increased. Assessment of iron stores at appropriate intervals is also important. With this management approach, most manifestations of the disease can be prevented.

Role of HFE Mutations in Other Liver Diseases

There is considerable interest in the role of HFE mutations and hepatic iron in several other liver diseases. Several studies have shown an increased prevalence of HFE mutations in PCT patients. Iron accentuates the inherited enzyme deficiency in PCT and clinical manifestations of PCT. The situation in nonalcoholic steatosis (NASH) is less clear, but some studies have shown an increased prevalence of HFE mutations in NASH patients. The role of phlebotomy therapy, however, is unproven. In chronic HCV infection, HFE mutations are not more common, but some subjects have increased hepatic iron. Before initiating antiviral therapy in these patients, it is reasonable to perform phlebotomy therapy to remove excess iron stores, because this reduces liver enzyme levels.

HFE mutations are not increased in frequency in alcoholic liver disease. Hemochromatosis in a heavy drinker can be distinguished from alcoholic liver disease by the presence of the C282Y mutation.

End-stage liver disease may also be associated with iron overload of the degree seen in hemochromatosis. The mechanism is uncertain, although recent evidence suggests that alcohol suppresses hepatic hepcidin secretion. Hemolysis also plays a role. HFE mutations are uncommon.

A recent large population study has shown that subjects homozygous for C282Y are at increased risk of breast and colorectal cancer.

Chapter 358. The Porphyrias >
 

The Porphyrias: Introduction

The porphyrias are metabolic disorders, each resulting from the deficiency of a specific enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 358-1 and Table 358-1). These enzyme deficiencies are inherited as autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked traits, with the exception of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), which usually is sporadic (Table 358-1). The porphyrias are classified as either hepatic or erythropoietic, depending on the primary site of overproduction and accumulation of their respective porphyrin precursors or porphyrins (Tables 358-1 and 358-2), although some have overlapping features. For example, PCT, the most common porphyria, is hepatic and presents with blistering cutaneous photosensitivity, which is usually a manifestation of the erythropoietic porphyrias. The major manifestations of the acute hepatic porphyrias are neurologic, including neuropathic abdominal pain, peripheral motor neuropathy, and mental disturbances, with attacks often precipitated by steroid hormones, certain drugs, and nutritional changes such as dieting. While hepatic porphyrias are symptomatic primarily in adults, rare homozygous variants of the autosomal dominant hepatic porphyrias usually manifest clinically prior to puberty.

In contrast, the erythropoietic porphyrias usually present with cutaneous photosensitivity at birth or in early childhood, or in the case of congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), even in utero as nonimmune hydrops fetalis. Cutaneous sensitivity to sunlight results from excitation of excess porphyrins in the skin by long-wave ultraviolet light, leading to cell damage, scarring, and disfigurement. Thus, the porphyrias are metabolic disorders in which genetic, physiologic, and environmental factors interact to cause disease.

Because many symptoms of the porphyrias are nonspecific, diagnosis is often delayed. Laboratory measurement of porphyrin precursors [5∩-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG)] or porphyrins in urine, plasma, erythrocytes, or feces is required to confirm or exclude the various types of porphyria (see below). However, a definite diagnosis requires demonstration of the specific enzyme deficiency or gene defect (Table 358-3). The isolation and characterization of the genes encoding all the heme biosynthetic enzymes has permitted identification of the mutations causing each porphyria (Table 358-2). Molecular genetic analyses now make it possible to provide precise heterozygote or homozygote identification and prenatal diagnoses in families with known mutations.

Heme Biosynthesis

Heme biosynthesis involves eight enzymatic steps in the conversion of glycine and succinyl-CoA to heme (Fig. 358-2 and Table 358-2). These eight enzymes are encoded by nine genes, as the first enzyme in the pathway, 5∩-aminolevulinate synthase (ALA-synthase), has two genes that encode unique housekeeping (ALAS1) and erythroid- specific (ALAS2) isozymes. The first and last three enzymes in the pathway are located in the mitochondrion, whereas the other four are in the cytosol. Heme is required for a variety of hemoproteins such as hemoglobin, myoglobin, respiratory cytochromes, and the cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs). Hemoglobin synthesis in erythroid precursor cells accounts for approximately 85% of daily heme synthesis in humans. Hepatocytes account for most of the rest, primarily for the synthesis of CYPs, which are especially abundant in the liver endoplasmic reticulum, and turn over more rapidly than many other hemoproteins, such as the mitochondrial respiratory cytochromes. As shown in Fig. 358-2, pathway intermediates are the porphyrin precursors, ALA and PBG, and porphyrins (mostly in their reduced forms, known as porphyrinogens). At least in humans, these intermediates do not accumulate in significant amounts under normal conditions or have important physiologic functions.

Figure 358-2

The first enzyme, ALA-synthase, catalyzes the condensation of glycine, activated by pyridoxal phosphate and succinyl coenzyme A, to form ALA. In the liver, this rate-limiting enzyme can be induced by a variety of drugs, steroids, and other chemicals. Distinct nonerythroid (e.g., housekeeping) and erythroid-specific forms of ALA-synthase are encoded by separate genes located on chromosomes 3p21.1 (ALAS1) and Xp11.2 (ALAS2), respectively. Defects in the erythroid gene ALAS2 that decrease its activity cause X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA). Recently, gain of function mutations in exon 11 of ALAS2 that increase its activity have been shown to cause an X-linked form of erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), known as X-linked protoporphyria (XLP).

The second enzyme, 5∩-aminolevulinate dehydratase (ALA-dehydratase), catalyzes the condensation of two molecules of ALA to form PBG. Hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMB-synthase; also known as PBG-deaminase) catalyzes the head-to-tail condensation of four PBG molecules by a series of deaminations to form the linear tetrapyrrole, HMB. Uroporphyrinogen III synthase (URO-synthase) catalyzes the rearrangement and rapid cyclization of HMB to form the asymmetric, physiologic, octacarboxylate porphyrinogen uroporphyrinogen (URO'gen) III.

The fifth enzyme in the pathway, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (URO-decarboxylase), catalyzes the sequential removal of the four carboxyl groups from the acetic acid side chains of URO'gen III to form coproporphyrinogen (COPRO'gen) III, a tetracarboxylate porphyrinogen. This compound then enters the mitochondrion via a specific transporter, ABCB6, where COPRO-oxidase, the sixth enzyme, catalyzes the decarboxylation of two of the four propionic acid groups to form the two vinyl groups of protoporphyrinogen (PROTO'gen) IX, a decarboxylate porphyrinogen. Next, PROTO-oxidase oxidizes PROTO IX'gen to protoporphyrin IX by the removal of six hydrogen atoms. The product of the reaction is a porphyrin (oxidized form), in contrast to the preceding tetrapyrrole intermediates, which are porphyrinogens (reduced forms). Finally, ferrous iron is inserted into protoporphyrin IX to form heme, a reaction catalyzed by the eighth enzyme in the pathway, ferrochelatase (also known as heme synthetase or protoheme ferrolyase).

Regulation of Heme Biosynthesis

Regulation of heme synthesis differs in the two major heme-forming tissues, the liver and erythron. In the liver, the concentration of "free" heme regulates the synthesis and mitochondrial translocation of the housekeeping form of ALA-synthase 1. Heme represses the synthesis of the ALA-synthase 1 mRNA and interferes with the transport of the enzyme from the cytosol into mitochondria. Hepatic ALA-synthase 1 is increased by many of the same chemicals that induce the cytochrome P450 enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum of the liver. Because most of the heme in the liver is used for the synthesis of cytochrome P450 enzymes, hepatic ALA-synthase 1 and the cytochrome P450s are regulated in a coordinated fashion, and many drugs that induce hepatic ALA-synthase 1 also induce the CYPs. The other hepatic heme biosynthetic enzymes are presumably expressed at constant levels, although their relative activities and kinetic properties differ. For example, normal individuals have high activities of ALA-dehydratase, but low activities of HMB-synthase, the latter being the second rate-limiting step in the pathway.

In the erythron, novel regulatory mechanisms allow for the production of the very large amounts of heme needed for hemoglobin synthesis. The response to stimuli for hemoglobin synthesis occurs during cell differentiation, leading to an increase in cell number. The erythroid-specific ALA-synthase 2 is expressed at higher levels than the housekeeping enzyme, and erythroid-specific control mechanisms regulate other pathway enzymes as well as iron transport into erythroid cells. Separate erythroid-specific and nonerythroid or "housekeeping" transcripts are known for the first four enzymes in the pathway. As noted above, housekeeping and erythroid-specific ALA-synthases are encoded by genes on different chromosomes, but for each of the next three genes in the pathway, both erythroid and nonerythroid transcripts are transcribed by alternative promoters from their single respective genes (Table 358-2).

Classification of the Porphyrias

As mentioned above, the porphyrias can be classified as either hepatic or erythropoietic, depending on whether the heme biosynthetic intermediates that accumulate arise initially from the liver or developing erythrocytes, or as acute or cutaneous, based on their clinical manifestations. Table 358-1 lists the porphyrias, their principal symptoms, and major biochemical abnormalities. Four of the five hepatic porphyrias〞acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), variegate porphyria (VP), and ALA-dehydratase porphyria (ADP)〞present during adult life with acute attacks of neurologic manifestations and elevated levels of one or both of the porphyrin precursors, ALA and PBG, and are thus classified as acute porphyrias. Patients with ADP have also presented in infancy and adolescence. The fifth hepatic disorder, porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), presents with blistering skin lesions. HCP and VP also may have cutaneous manifestations similar to PCT.

The erythropoietic porphyrias〞congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) and erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), including the recently described X-linked form, XLP〞are characterized by elevations of porphyrins in bone marrow and erythrocytes and present with cutaneous photosensitivity. The skin lesions in CEP resemble PCT but are usually much more severe, whereas EPP and XLP cause a more immediate, painful, and nonblistering type of photosensitivity. EPP is the most common porphyria to cause symptoms before puberty. About 20% of EPP patients develop minor abnormalities of liver function, with up to about 5% developing hepatic complications that can become life-threatening. XLP has a clinical presentation similar to EPP causing photosensitivity and liver disease.

Diagnosis of Porphyria

A few specific and sensitive first-line laboratory tests should be used whenever symptoms or signs suggest the diagnosis of porphyria (Table 358-3). If a first-line test is significantly abnormal, more comprehensive testing should follow to establish the type of porphyria, and finally the specific causative gene mutation.

Acute Porphyrias

An acute porphyria should be suspected in patients with neurovisceral symptoms after puberty, such as abdominal pain, and when the initial clinical evaluation does not suggest another cause, the urinary porphyrin precursors (ALA and PBG) should be measured (Fig. 358-2). Urinary PBG is virtually always increased during acute attacks of AIP, HCP, and VP and is not substantially increased in any other medical condition. Therefore, this measurement is both sensitive and specific. A method for rapid, in-house testing for urinary PBG, such as the Trace PBG kit (Trace America/Trace Diagnostics, Louisville, Colorado), can be used. Results from spot (single void) urine specimens are highly informative because very substantial increases in PBG are expected during acute attacks of porphyria. A 24-h collection can unnecessarily delay diagnosis. The same spot urine specimen should be saved for quantitative determination of ALA, PBG, and creatinine, in order to confirm the qualitative PBG result and also to detect patients with ALAD-deficient porphyria (ADP). Urinary porphyrins may remain increased longer than porphyrin precursors in HCP and VP. Therefore, it is useful to measure total urinary porphyrins in the same sample, keeping in mind that urinary porphyrin increases are often nonspecific. Measurement of urinary porphyrins alone should be avoided for screening, because these may be increased in disorders other than porphyrias, such as chronic liver disease, and misdiagnoses of porphyria can result from minimal increases in urinary porphyrins that have no diagnostic significance. Measurement of erythrocyte HMB-synthase is not useful as a first-line test in the acute setting because it does not differentiate latent from active AIP. Moreover, the enzyme activity is not decreased in all AIP patients and is never deficient in other acute porphyrias.

Cutaneous Porphyrias

Blistering skin lesions due to porphyria are virtually always accompanied by increases in total plasma porphyrins. A fluorometric method is preferred, because the porphyrins in plasma in VP are mostly covalently linked to plasma proteins and may be less readily detected by HPLC. The normal range for plasma porphyrins is somewhat increased in patients with end-stage renal disease.

Although a total plasma porphyrin determination will usually detect EPP and XLP, an erythrocyte protoporphyrin determination is more sensitive. Increases in erythrocyte protoporphyrin occur in many other conditions. Therefore, the diagnosis of EPP must be confirmed by showing a predominant increase in free protoporphyrin rather than zinc protoporphyrin. In XLP, both free and zinc protoporphyrin are markedly increased in approximately equal proportions. Interpretation of laboratory reports can be difficult, because the term free erythrocyte protoporphyrin sometimes actually represents zinc protoporphyrin.

More extensive testing is justified when an initial test is positive. A substantial increase in PBG may be due to AIP, HCP, or VP. These acute porphyrias can be distinguished by measuring erythrocyte HMB-synthase, urinary porphyrins (using the same spot urine sample), fecal porphyrins, and plasma porphyrins. Assays for COPRO-oxidase or PROTO-oxidase are not widely available. Alternatively, sequencing the genes encoding HMB-synthase, COPRO-oxidase, and PROTO-oxidase will detect most disease-causing mutations, and will be diagnostic even when the levels of urinary ALA and PBG have returned to normal or near-normal levels. The various porphyrias that cause blistering skin lesions are differentiated by measuring porphyrins in urine, feces, and plasma. These porphyrias can also be confirmed at the DNA level by the demonstration of the causative mutation(s). It is often difficult to diagnose or "rule out" porphyria in patients who have had suggestive symptoms months or years in the past, and in relatives of patients with acute porphyrias, because porphyrin precursors and porphyrins may be normal. In those situations, detection of the specific gene mutation in the index case can make the diagnosis. Consultation with a specialist laboratory and physician is useful for selecting which heme biosynthetic gene or genes to be sequenced. Before evaluating relatives, the gene-based diagnosis of porphyria should be established in an index case. Once a specific mutation is identified in an affected member, other at-risk relatives can be offered genetic counseling and testing for that mutation. Further details are provided in the sections below on each type of porphyria.
 
The Hepatic Porphyrias

Markedly elevated plasma and urinary concentrations of the porphyrin precursors ALA or PBG, which originate from the liver, are especially evident during attacks of neurologic manifestations of the four acute porphyrias, ADP, AIP, HCP, and VP. In PCT, excess porphyrins also accumulate initially in the liver and cause chronic blistering of sun-exposed areas of the skin.

Ala-Dehydratase Deficient Porphyria (Adp)

ADP is a rare autosomal recessive acute hepatic porphyria caused by a severe deficiency of ALA-dehydratase activity. To date, there are only a few documented cases, some in children or young adults, in which specific gene mutations have been identified. These affected homozygotes had <10% of normal ALA-dehydratase activity in erythrocytes, but their clinically asymptomatic parents and heterozygous relatives had about half-normal levels of activity and did not excrete increased levels of ALA. The frequency of ADP is unknown, but the frequency of heterozygous individuals with <50% normal ALA-dehydratase activity was 2% in a screening study in Sweden. Because there are multiple causes for deficient ALA-dehydratase activity, it is important to confirm the diagnosis of ADP by mutation analysis.

Clinical Features

The clinical presentation depends on the amount of residual ALA-dehydratase activity. Four of the six documented patients were male adolescents with symptoms resembling those of AIP, including abdominal pain and neuropathy. One patient was an infant with more severe disease, including failure to thrive beginning at birth. The earlier age of onset and more severe manifestations in this patient reflect a more significant deficiency of ALA-dehydratase activity. Another patient developed an acute motor polyneuropathy at age 63 that was associated with a myeloproliferative disorder. He was heterozygous for an ALAD mutation that presumably was present in erythroblasts that underwent clonal expansion due to the bone marrow malignancy.

Diagnosis

All patients had significantly elevated levels of plasma and urinary ALA and urinary coproporphyrin (COPRO) III; ALAD activities in erythrocytes were <10% of normal. Hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (fumarylacetoacetase deficiency) and lead intoxication should be considered in the differential diagnosis since either succinylacetone (which accumulates in hereditary tyrosinemia and is structurally similar to ALA) or lead can inhibit ALA-dehydratase, increase urinary excretion of ALA and COPRO III, and cause manifestations that resemble those of the acute porphyrias. Heterozygotes are clinically asymptomatic and do not excrete increased levels of ALA, but can be detected by demonstration of intermediate levels of erythrocyte ALA-dehydratase activity or a specific mutation in the ALAD gene. To date, molecular studies of ADP patients have identified nine point mutations, two splice-site mutations, and a two-base deletion in the ALAD gene (Human Gene Mutation Database; www.hgmd.org). The parents in each case were not consanguineous, and the index cases had inherited a different ALAD mutation from each parent. Prenatal diagnosis of this disorder is possible by determination of ALA-dehydratase activity and/or gene mutation in cultured chorionic villi or amniocytes.

Treatment: Ala-Dehydratase Deficient Poryphyria

The treatment of ADP acute attacks is similar to that of AIP (see below). The severely affected infant referred to above was supported by hyperalimentation and periodic blood transfusions, but did not respond to intravenous hemin and died after liver transplantation.

Acute Intermittent Porphyria (Aip)

This hepatic porphyria is an autosomal dominant condition resulting from the half-normal level of HMB-synthase activity. The disease is widespread but is especially common in Scandinavia and Great Britain. Clinical expression is highly variable, and activation of the disease is often related to environmental or hormonal factors, such as drugs, diet, and steroid hormones. Attacks can be prevented by avoiding known precipitating factors. Rare homozygous dominant AIP also has been described in children (see below).

Clinical Features

Induction of the rate-limiting hepatic enzyme ALA-synthase in AIP heterozygotes with half-normal HMB-synthase activity is thought to underlie the acute attacks in AIP and other acute porphyrias. The disorder remains latent (or asymptomatic) in the great majority of those who are heterozygous for HMB-synthase mutations, and this is almost always the case prior to puberty. In patients with no history of acute symptoms, porphyrin precursor excretion is usually normal, suggesting that half-normal hepatic HMB-synthase activity is sufficient, and that hepatic ALA-synthase activity is not increased. However, under conditions where heme synthesis is increased in the liver, half-normal HMB-synthase activity may become limiting, and ALA, PBG, and other heme pathway intermediates may accumulate and be excreted in the urine. Common precipitating factors include endogenous and exogenous steroids, porphyrinogenic drugs, alcohol ingestion, and low-calorie diets, usually instituted for weight loss.

The fact that AIP is almost always latent before puberty suggests that adult levels of steroid hormones are important for clinical expression. Symptoms are more common in women, suggesting a role for estrogens or progestins. Premenstrual attacks are probably due to endogenous progesterone. Acute porphyrias are sometimes exacerbated by exogenous steroids, including oral contraceptive preparations containing progestins. Surprisingly, pregnancy is usually well tolerated, suggesting that beneficial metabolic changes may ameliorate the effects of high levels of progesterone. Table 358-4 provides a partial list of the major drugs that are harmful in AIP (and also in HCP and VP). Extensive lists of unsafe and safe drugs are available on websites sponsored by the American Porphyria Foundation (www.porphyriafoundation.com), the European Porphyria Initiative (www.porphyria-europe.org), and at the Drug Database for Acute Porphyrias website (www.drugs-porphyria.com). Reduced intake of calories and carbohydrate, as may occur with illness or attempts to lose weight, can also increase porphyrin precursor excretion and induce attacks of porphyria. Increased carbohydrate intake can ameliorate attacks. Studies in a knockout AIP mouse model indicate that the hepatic ALAS1 gene is regulated by the peroxisome proliferator每activated receptor  coactivator 1 (PGC-1). Hepatic PGC-1 is induced by fasting, which in turn activates ALAS1 transcription, resulting in increased heme biosynthesis. This finding suggests an important link between nutritional status and the attacks in acute porphyrias. Attacks also can be provoked by infections, surgery, and ethanol.

Because the neurovisceral symptoms rarely occur before puberty and are often nonspecific, a high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis. The disease can be disabling but is rarely fatal. Abdominal pain, the most common symptom, is usually steady and poorly localized but may be cramping. Ileus, abdominal distention, and decreased bowel sounds are common. However, increased bowel sounds and diarrhea may occur. Abdominal tenderness, fever, and leukocytosis are usually absent or mild because the symptoms are neurologic rather than inflammatory. Nausea; vomiting; constipation; tachycardia; hypertension; mental symptoms; pain in the limbs, head, neck, or chest; muscle weakness; sensory loss; dysuria; and urinary retention are characteristic. Tachycardia, hypertension, restlessness, tremors, and excess sweating are due to sympathetic overactivity.

The peripheral neuropathy is due to axonal degeneration (rather than demyelinization) and primarily affects motor neurons. Significant neuropathy does not occur with all acute attacks; abdominal symptoms are usually more prominent. Motor neuropathy affects the proximal muscles initially, more often in the shoulders and arms. The course and degree of involvement are variable and sometimes may be focal and involve cranial nerves. Deep tendon reflexes initially may be normal or hyperactive but become decreased or absent as the neuropathy advances. Sensory changes such as paresthesia and loss of sensation are less prominent. Progression to respiratory and bulbar paralysis and death occurs especially when the diagnosis and treatment are delayed. Sudden death may result from sympathetic overactivity and cardiac arrhythmia.

Mental symptoms such as anxiety, insomnia, depression, disorientation, hallucinations, and paranoia can occur in acute attacks. Seizures can be due to neurologic effects or to hyponatremia. Treatment of seizures is difficult because most antiseizure drugs can exacerbate AIP (clonazepam may be safer than phenytoin or barbiturates). Hyponatremia results from hypothalamic involvement and inappropriate vasopressin secretion or from electrolyte depletion due to vomiting, diarrhea, poor intake, or excess renal sodium loss. Persistent hypertension and impaired renal function may occur. When an attack resolves, abdominal pain may disappear within hours, and paresis begins to improve within days and may continue to improve over several years.

Homozygous dominant AIP is a rare form of AIP in which patients inherit HMBS mutations from each of their heterozygous parents and, therefore, have very low (<2%) enzyme activity. The disease has been described in a Dutch girl, two young British siblings, and a Spanish boy. In these homozygous affected patients, the disease presented in infancy with failure to thrive, developmental delay, bilateral cataracts, and/or hepatosplenomegaly. Urinary ALA and PBG concentrations were markedly elevated. All of these patients' HMBS mutations (R167W, R167Q, and R172Q) were in exon 10 within five bases of each other. Studies of the brain MRIs of children with homozygous AIP have suggested damage primarily in white matter that was myelinated postnatally, while tracks that myelinated prenatally were normal. Most children with homozygous AIP die at an early age.

Diagnosis

ALA and PBG levels are substantially increased in plasma and urine, especially during acute attacks, and become normal only after prolonged latency. For example, urinary PBG excretion during an attack is usually 50每200 mg/24 h (220每880 mol/24 h) [normal, 0每4 mg/24 h (0每18 mol/24 h)], and urinary ALA excretion is 20每100 mg/24 h (150每760 mol/24 h) [normal, 1每7 mg/24 h (8每53 mol/ 24 h)]. Because levels often remain high after symptoms resolve, the diagnosis of an acute attack in a patient with biochemically proven AIP is based primarily on clinical features. Excretion of ALA and PBG decrease dramatically after intravenous hemin. A normal urinary PBG level before hemin effectively excludes AIP as a cause for current symptoms. Fecal porphyrins are usually normal or minimally increased in AIP, in contrast to HCP and VP. Most heterozygotes with HMB-synthase deficiency with no history of symptoms have normal urinary excretion of ALA and PBG. Therefore, measurement of HMB-synthase in erythrocytes or, better, the detection of the family's HMBS mutation will diagnose asymptomatic family members.

The enzyme deficiency is detectable in erythrocytes from most AIP heterozygotes. Because the activity is higher in young erythrocytes, it may increase into the normal range if erythropoiesis is increased due to a concurrent condition. Furthermore, patients with HMBS mutations in the initiation of translation codon in exon 1 and in the intron 1 5∩-splice donor site have normal enzyme levels in erythrocytes and deficient activity only in nonerythroid tissues. This occurs because the erythroid and housekeeping forms of HMB-synthase are encoded by a single gene, which has two promoters. More than 315 HMBS mutations have been identified in AIP, including missense, nonsense, and splicing mutations and insertions and deletions, with most mutations found in only one or a few families (Human Gene Mutation Database, www.hgmd.org). The prenatal diagnosis of a fetus at risk can be made with cultured amniotic cells or chorionic villi. However, this is seldom done, because the prognosis of individuals with HMBS mutations is generally favorable.

Treatment: Acute Intermittent Porphyria

During acute attacks, narcotic analgesics may be required for abdominal pain, and phenothiazines are useful for nausea, vomiting, anxiety, and restlessness. Chloral hydrate can be given for insomnia, and benzodiazepines are probably safe in low doses if a minor tranquilizer is required. Carbohydrate loading, usually with intravenous glucose (at least 300 g/dL of 10% dextrose in water daily), may be effective in milder acute attacks of porphyria (without paresis, hyponatremia, etc.). Because intravenous hemin is more effective and the response slower if treatment is delayed, it is no longer recommended that hemin therapy for a severe attack be started only after an unsuccessful trial of intravenous glucose for several days. Hemin should be used initially for severe attacks and for mild attacks that do not respond to carbohydrate loading within 1每2 days. The standard regimen is 3每4 mg/kg of heme, in the form of lyophilized hematin (Lundbeck Pharmaceuticals), heme albumin (hematin reconstituted with human albumin), or heme arginate (Orphan Europe), infused daily for 4 days. Heme arginate and heme albumin are chemically stable and are less likely than hematin to produce phlebitis or an anticoagulant effect. Recovery depends on the degree of neuronal damage and usually is rapid if therapy is started early. Recovery from severe motor neuropathy may require months or years. Identification and avoidance of inciting factors can hasten recovery from an attack and prevent future attacks. Inciting factors are usually multiple, and removal of one or more hastens recovery and helps prevent future attacks. Frequent attacks that occur during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle may be prevented with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue, which prevents ovulation and progesterone production, or by preventive monthly hematin administration.

The long-term risk of hypertension and chronic renal disease is increased in AIP; a number of patients have undergone successful renal transplantation. Chronic, low-grade abnormalities in liver function tests are common, and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma is increased. Hepatic imaging is recommended at least yearly for early detection of these tumors.

An allogeneic liver transplant was performed on a 19-year-old female AIP heterozygote who had 37 acute attacks in the 29 months prior to transplantation. Post-transplantation, her elevated urinary ALA and BPG levels returned to normal in 24 h, and she did not experience acute neurologic, attacks for more than 3 years post-transplant. Two AIP patients had combined liver and kidney transplants secondary to uncontrolled acute porphyria attacks, chronic peripheral neuropathy, and renal failure requiring dialysis. Both patients had a marked improvement with no attacks and normal urinary PBG levels post-transplantation, as well as improvement of their neuropathic manifestations. To date, a number of women with AIP have had successful liver transplants for severe recurrent neurologic attacks and secondary organ damage with amelioration of their neurologic attacks and normalization of their heme precursors. However, liver transplantation is a high-risk procedure and should be considered as a last resort in patients with severe recurrent attacks. Recently, liver-directed gene therapy has been successful in the prevention of drug-induced biochemical attacks in a murine model of human AIP.

Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (Pct)

PCT, the most common of the porphyrias, can be either sporadic (type 1) or familial (type 2) and can also develop after exposure to halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons. Hepatic URO-decarboxylase is deficient in all types of PCT, and for clinical symptoms to manifest, this enzyme deficiency must be substantial (20% of normal activity or less); it is currently attributed to generation of an URO-decarboxylase inhibitor in the liver in the presence of iron and under conditions of oxidative stress, although it remains to be isolated and characterized.

The majority of PCT patients (80%) have no UROD mutations and are said to have sporadic (type 1) disease. PCT patients heterozygous for UROD mutations have familial (type 2) PCT. In these patients, inheritance of a UROD mutation from one parent results in half-normal enzyme activity in liver and all other tissues, which is a significant predisposing factor, but is insufficient by itself to cause symptomatic PCT. As discussed below, other genetic and environmental factors contribute to susceptibility for both types of PCT. Because penetrance of the genetic trait is low, many patients with familial (type 2) PCT have no family history of the disease. Hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP) is an autosomal recessive form of porphyria that results from the marked systemic deficiency of URO-decarboxylase activity with clinical symptoms in childhood.

Clinical Features

Blistering skin lesions that appear most commonly on the backs of the hands are the major clinical feature (Fig. 358-3). These rupture and crust over, leaving areas of atrophy and scarring. Lesions may also occur on the forearms, face, legs, and feet. Skin friability and small white papules termed milia are common, especially on the backs of the hands and fingers. Hypertrichosis and hyperpigmentation, especially of the face, are especially troublesome in women. Occasionally, the skin over sun-exposed areas becomes severely thickened, with scarring and calcification that resembles systemic sclerosis. Neurologic features are absent.

A number of susceptibility factors, in addition to inherited UROD mutations in type 2 PCT, can be recognized clinically and can affect management. These include hepatitis C, HIV, excess alcohol, elevated iron levels, and estrogens. The importance of excess hepatic iron as a precipitating factor is underscored by the finding that the incidence of the common hemochromatosis-causing mutations, hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations C282Y and H63D, is increased in patients with types 1 and 2 PCT (Chap. 357). Excess alcohol is a long-recognized contributor, as is estrogen use in women. HIV is probably an independent but less common risk factor that, like hepatitis C, does not cause PCT in isolation. Multiple susceptibility factors that appear to act synergistically can be identified in the individual PCT patient. Patients with PCT characteristically have chronic liver disease and sometimes cirrhosis and are at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. Various chemicals can also induce PCT; an epidemic of PCT occurred in eastern Turkey in the 1950s as a consequence of wheat contaminated with the fungicide hexachlorobenzene. PCT also occurs after exposure to other chemicals, including di- and trichlorophenols and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-(p)-dioxin (TCDD, dioxin).

Diagnosis

Porphyrins are increased in the liver, plasma, urine, and stool. The urinary ALA level may be slightly increased, but the PBG level is normal. Urinary porphyrins consist mostly of URO and heptacarboxylate porphyrin, with lesser amounts of COPRO and hexa- and pentacarboxylate porphyrins. Plasma porphyrins are also increased, and fluorometric scanning of diluted plasma at neutral pH can rapidly distinguish VP and PCT (Table 358-3). Isocoproporphyrins, which are increased in feces and sometimes in plasma and urine, are diagnostic for hepatic URO-decarboxylase deficiency.

Type 2 PCT and HEP can be distinguished from type 1 by finding decreased URO-decarboxylase in erythrocytes. URO-decarboxylase activity in liver, erythrocytes, and cultured skin fibroblasts in type 2 PCT is approximately 50% of normal in affected individuals and in family members with latent disease. In HEP, the URO-decarboxylase activity is markedly deficient, with typical levels of 3每10% of normal. More than 105 mutations have been identified in the UROD gene (Human Gene Mutation Database; www.hgmd.org). Of the mutations listed in the database, 65% are missense or nonsense and 10% are splice-site mutations. Most UROD mutations have been identified in only one or two families.

Treatment: Porphyria Cutanea Tarda

Alcohol, estrogens, iron supplements, and, if possible, any drugs that may exacerbate the disease should be discontinued, but this step does not always lead to improvement. A complete response can almost always be achieved by the standard therapy, repeated phlebotomy, to reduce hepatic iron. A unit (450 mL) of blood can be removed every 1每2 weeks. The aim is to gradually reduce excess hepatic iron until the serum ferritin reaches the lower limits of normal. Because iron overload is not marked in most cases, remission may occur after only five or six phlebotomies; however, PCT patients with hemochromatosis may require more treatments to bring their iron levels down to the normal range. To document improvement in PCT, it is most convenient to follow the total plasma porphyrin concentration, which becomes normal some time after the target ferritin level is reached. Hemoglobin levels or hematocrits and serum ferritin should be followed closely to prevent development of iron deficiency and anemia. After remission, continued phlebotomy may not be needed. Plasma porphyrin levels are followed at 6每12-month intervals for early detection of recurrences, which are treated by additional phlebotomy.

An alternative when phlebotomy is contraindicated or poorly tolerated is a low-dose regimen of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, both of which complex with the excess porphyrins and promote their excretion. Small doses (e.g., 125 mg chloroquine phosphate twice weekly) should be given, because standard doses can induce transient, sometimes marked increases in photosensitivity and hepatocellular damage. Hepatic imaging can diagnose or exclude complicating hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment of PCT in patients with end-stage renal disease is facilitated by administration of erythropoietin.

Hereditary Coproporphyria (Hcp)

HCP is an autosomal dominant hepatic porphyria that results from the half-normal activity of COPRO-oxidase. The disease presents with acute attacks, as in AIP. Cutaneous photosensitivity also may occur, but much less commonly than in VP. HCP patients may have acute attacks and cutaneous photosensitivity together or separately. HCP is less common than AIP and VP. Homozygous dominant HCP and harderoporphyria, a biochemically distinguishable variant of HCP, present with clinical symptoms in children (see below).

Clinical Features

HCP is influenced by the same factors that cause attacks in AIP. The disease is latent before puberty, and symptoms, which are virtually identical to those of AIP, are more common in women. HCP is generally less severe than AIP. Blistering skin lesions are identical to PCT and VP and begin in childhood in rare homozygous cases.

Diagnosis

COPRO III is markedly increased in the urine and feces in symptomatic disease and often persists, especially in feces, when there are no symptoms. Urinary ALA and PBG levels are increased (but less than in AIP) during acute attacks, but may revert to normal more quickly than in AIP when symptoms resolve. Plasma porphyrins are usually normal or only slightly increased, but they may be higher in cases with skin lesions. The diagnosis of HCP is readily confirmed by increased fecal porphyrins consisting almost entirely of COPRO III, which distinguishes it from other porphyrias.

Although the diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring COPRO-oxidase activity, the assays for this mitochondrial enzyme are not widely available and require cells other than erythrocytes. The CPOX gene has been cloned and more than 50 mutations, 70% of which are missense or nonsense, have been identified in unrelated patients (Human Gene Mutation Database; www.hgmd.org). Detection of a CPOX mutation in a symptomatic individual permits the identification of asymptomatic family members.

Treatment: Hereditary Coproporphyria

Neurologic symptoms are treated as in AIP (see above). Phlebotomy and chloroquine are ineffective when cutaneous lesions are present.

Variegate Porphyria (Vp)

VP is an autosomal dominant hepatic porphyria that results from the deficient activity of PROTO-oxidase, the seventh enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway, and can present with neurologic symptoms, photosensitivity, or both. VP is particularly common in South Africa, where 3 of every 1000 whites have the disorder. Most are descendants of a couple who emigrated from Holland to South Africa in 1688. In other countries, VP is less common than AIP. Rare cases of homozygous dominant VP, presenting in childhood with cutaneous symptoms, also have been reported.

Clinical Features

VP can present with skin photosensitivity, acute neurovisceral crises, or both. In two large studies of VP patients, 59% had only skin lesions, 20% had only acute attacks, and 22% had both. Acute attacks are identical to those in AIP and are precipitated by the same factors as AIP (see above). Blistering skin manifestations are similar to those in PCT, but are more difficult to treat and usually are of longer duration. Homozygous VP is associated with photosensitivity, neurologic symptoms, and developmental disturbances, including growth retardation, in infancy or childhood; all cases had increased erythrocyte levels of zinc protoporphyrin, a characteristic finding in all homozygous porphyrias so far described.

Diagnosis

Urinary ALA and PBG levels are increased during acute attacks but may return to normal more quickly than in AIP. Increases in fecal protoporphyrin and COPRO III and in urinary COPRO III are more persistent. Plasma porphyrin levels also are increased, particularly when there are cutaneous lesions. VP can be distinguished rapidly from all other porphyrias by examining the fluorescence emission spectrum of porphyrins in plasma at neutral pH since VP has a unique fluorescence peak at neutral pH.

Assays of PROTO-oxidase activity in cultured fibroblasts or lymphocytes are not widely available. More than 145 mutations have been identified in the PPOX gene from unrelated VP patients (Human Gene Mutation Database; www.hgmd.org). The missense mutation R59W is the common mutation in most South Africans with VP of Dutch descent. Five missense mutations were common in English and French VP patients; however, most mutations have been found in only one or two families.

Treatment: Variegate Porphyria

Acute attacks are treated as in AIP, and hemin should be started early in most cases. Other than avoiding sun exposure, there are few effective measures for treating the skin lesions. -Carotene, phlebotomy, and chloroquine are not helpful.
 
The Erythropoietic Porphyrias

In the erythropoietic porphyrias, excess porphyrins from bone marrow erythrocyte precursors are transported via the plasma to the skin and lead to cutaneous photosensitivity.

X-Linked Sideroblastic Anemia (Xlsa)

XLSA results from the deficient activity of the erythroid form of ALA-synthase and is associated with ineffective erythropoiesis, weakness, and pallor.

Clinical Features

Typically, males with XLSA develop refractory hemolytic anemia, pallor, and weakness during infancy. They have secondary hypersplenism, become iron overloaded, and can develop hemosiderosis. The severity depends on the level of residual erythroid ALA-synthase activity and on the responsiveness of the specific mutation to pyridoxal 5∩-phosphate supplementation (see below). Peripheral blood smears reveal a hypochromic, microcytic anemia with striking anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, and polychromasia; the leukocytes and platelets appear normal. Hemoglobin content is reduced, and the mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration are decreased. Patients with milder, late-onset disease have been reported recently.

Diagnosis

Bone marrow examination reveals hypercellularity with a left shift and megaloblastic erythropoiesis with an abnormal maturation. A variety of Prussian blue每staining sideroblasts are observed. Levels of urinary porphyrin precursors and of both urinary and fecal porphyrins are normal. The level of erythroid ALA-synthase is decreased in bone marrow, but this enzyme is difficult to measure in the presence of the normal ALA-synthase housekeeping enzyme. Definitive diagnosis requires the demonstration of mutations in the erythroid ALAS2 gene.

Treatment: X-Linked Sideroblastic Anemia

The severe anemia may respond to pyridoxine supplementation. This cofactor is essential for ALA-synthase activity, and mutations in the pyridoxine-binding site of the enzyme have been found in several responsive patients. Cofactor supplementation may make it possible to eliminate or reduce the frequency of transfusion. Unresponsive patients may be transfusion-dependent and require chelation therapy.

Congenital Erythropoietic Porphyria (Cep)

CEP, also known as G邦nther disease, is an autosomal recessive disorder. It is due to the markedly deficient, but not absent, activity of URO-synthase and the resultant accumulation of URO I and COPRO I isomers. CEP is associated with hemolytic anemia and cutaneous lesions.

Clinical Features

Severe cutaneous photosensitivity begins in early infancy. The skin over light-exposed areas is friable, and bullae and vesicles are prone to rupture and infection. Skin thickening, focal hypo- and hyperpigmentation, and hypertrichosis of the face and extremities are characteristic. Secondary infection of the cutaneous lesions can lead to disfigurement of the face and hands. Porphyrins are deposited in teeth and in bones. As a result, the teeth are reddish-brown and fluoresce on exposure to long-wave ultraviolet light. Hemolysis is probably due to the marked increase in erythrocyte porphyrins and leads to splenomegaly. Adults with a milder form of the disease also have been described.

Diagnosis

URO and COPRO (mostly type I isomers) accumulate in the bone marrow, erythrocytes, plasma, urine, and feces. The predominant porphyrin in feces is COPRO I. The diagnosis of CEP can be confirmed by demonstration of markedly deficient URO-synthase activity and/or the identification of specific mutations in the UROS gene. The disease can be detected in utero by measuring porphyrins in amniotic fluid and URO-synthase activity in cultured amniotic cells or chorionic villi, or by the detection of the family's specific gene mutations. Molecular analyses of the mutant alleles from more than 50 unrelated patients have revealed the presence of more than 35 mutations in the UROS gene, including four in the erythroid-specific promoter of the UROS gene. Genotype/phenotype correlations can predict the severity of the disease.

Treatment: Congenital Erythropoietic Porphyria

Severe cases often require transfusions for anemia. Chronic transfusions of sufficient blood to suppress erythropoiesis are effective in reducing porphyrin production, but results in iron overload. Splenectomy may reduce hemolysis and decrease transfusion requirements. Protection from sunlight and from minor skin trauma is important. -Carotene may be of some value. Complicating bacterial infections should be treated promptly. Recently, bone marrow and cord blood transplantation has proven curative in several transfusion-dependent children, providing the rationale for stem-cell gene therapy.

Erythropoietic Protoporphyria (Epp)

EPP is an inherited disorder resulting from the deficient activity of ferrochelatase, the last enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. EPP is the most common erythropoietic porphyria in children and, after PCT, the second most common porphyria in adults. EPP patients have ferrochelatase activities as low as 15每25% in lymphocytes and cultured fibroblasts. Protoporphyrin accumulates in bone marrow reticulocytes and then appears in plasma, is taken up in the liver, and excreted in bile and feces. Protoporphyrin transported to the skin causes nonblistering photosensitivity. In most symptomatic patients (90%) with this autosomal recessive disorder, a mutation in one FECH allele is inherited with a relatively common (10% normal whites) intronic 3 (IVS3) alteration (IVS3-48T>C) that results in the low expression of the normal enzyme. In about 10% of EPP families, two FECH mutations have been found. Recently, deletion mutations in exon 11 of the ALAS2 gene have been described, which cause an X-linked protoporphyria (XLP) that is clinically indistinguishable from EPP. The deletion of the carboxy-terminal amino acid of ALAS2 results in increased ALA-synthase 2 activity and the accumulation of protoporphyrin. XLP accounts for approximately 2% of cases with the EPP phenotype.

Clinical Features

Skin photosensitivity, which differs from that in other porphyrias, usually begins in childhood and consists of pain, redness, and itching occurring within minutes of sunlight exposure (Fig. 358-4). Photosensitivity is associated with substantial elevations in erythrocyte protoporphyrin and occurs only in patients with genotypes that result in ferrochelatase activities lower than 35% of normal. Vesicular lesions are uncommon. Redness, swelling, burning, and itching can develop shortly after sun exposure and resemble angioedema. Symptoms may seem out of proportion to the visible skin lesions. Sparse vesicles and bullae occur in 10% of cases. Chronic skin changes may include lichenification, leathery pseudovesicles, labial grooving, and nail changes. Severe scarring is rare, as are pigment changes, friability, and hirsutism. Unless hepatic or other complications develop, protoporphyrin levels and symptoms of photosensitivity remain remarkably stable over many years in most patients. Factors that exacerbate the hepatic porphyrias play little or no role in EPP.

Figure 358-4

The primary source of excess protoporphyrin is the bone marrow reticulocytes. Erythrocyte protoporphyrin is free (not complexed with zinc) and is mostly bound to hemoglobin. In plasma, protoporphyrin is bound to albumin. Hemolysis and anemia are usually absent or mild.

Although EPP is an erythropoietic porphyria, up to 20% of EPP patients may have minor abnormalities of liver function, and in about 5% of these patients the accumulation of protoporphyrins causes chronic liver disease that can progress to liver failure and death. Protoporphyrin is insoluble, and excess amounts form crystalline structures in liver cells (Fig. 358-4) and can decrease hepatic bile flow. Studies in the mouse model of EPP have shown that the bile duct epithelium may be damaged by toxic bile, leading to biliary fibrosis. Thus, rapidly progressive liver disease appears to be related to the cholestatic effects of protoporphyrins and is associated with increasing hepatic protoporphyrin levels due to impaired hepatobiliary excretion and increased photosensitivity. The hepatic complications also are often characterized by increasing levels of protoporphyrins in erythrocytes and plasma as well as severe abdominal and back pains, especially in the right upper quadrant. Gallstones composed at least in part of protoporphyrin occur in some patients. Hepatic complications appear to be higher in autosomal recessive EPP due to two FECH mutations and in XLP.

Diagnosis

A substantial increase in erythrocyte protoporphyrin, which is predominantly free and not complexed with zinc, is the hallmark of EPP. Protoporphyrin levels are also variably increased in bone marrow, plasma, bile, and feces. Erythrocyte protoporphyrin concentrations are increased in other conditions such as lead poisoning, iron deficiency, various hemolytic disorders, all homozygous forms of other porphyrias, and sometimes even in acute porphyrias. In all these conditions, however, in contrast to EPP, protoporphyrin is complexed with zinc. Therefore, after an increase in erythrocyte protoporphyrin is found in a suspected EPP patient, it is important to confirm the diagnosis by an assay that distinguishes free and zinc-complexed protoporphyrin. Erythrocytes in EPP also exhibit red fluorescence under a fluorescence microscopy at 620 nm. Urinary levels of porphyrins and porphyrin precursors are normal. Ferrochelatase activity in cultured lymphocytes or fibroblasts is decreased. DNA diagnosis by mutation analysis is recommended to detect the causative FECH mutation(s) and/or the presence of the IVS3-48T>C hypo-expression allele. To date, 125 mutations have been identified in the FECH gene, many of which result in an unstable or absent enzyme protein (null alleles) (Human Gene Mutation Database; www.hgmd.org). Studies suggest that EPP patients with a null allele (and the IVS3-48T>C hypo-expression allele) have a great risk for developing severe liver complications. In XLP, the erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels appear to be higher than other forms of EPP and the proportions of free and zinc protoporphyrins are approximately equivalent. To date, two ALAS2 mutations, all deletions of 1 to 4 bases, have been described, which markedly increase ALAS2 activity and cause XLP.

Treatment: Erythropoietic Protoporphyria

Avoiding sunlight exposure and wearing clothing designed to provide protection for conditions with chronic photosensitivity are essential. Oral -carotene (120每180 mg/dL) improves tolerance to sunlight in some patients. The beneficial effects of -carotene may involve quenching of singlet oxygen or free radicals. The dosage may need to be adjusted to maintain serum carotene levels in the recommended range of 10每15 mmol/L (600每800 mg/dL). Mild skin discoloration due to carotenemia is the only significant side effect.

Treatment of hepatic complications, which may be accompanied by motor neuropathy, is difficult. Cholestyramine and other porphyrin absorbents such as activated charcoal may interrupt the enterohepatic circulation of protoporphyrin and promote its fecal excretion, leading to some improvement. Splenectomy may be helpful when the disease is accompanied by hemolysis and significant splenomegaly. Plasmapheresis and intravenous hemin are sometimes beneficial.

Liver transplantation has been carried out in some EPP and XLP patients with severe liver complications and is often successful in the short term. However, disease often recurs in the transplanted liver due to continued bone marrow production of excess protoporphyrin. In a retrospective study of 17 liver-transplanted EPP patients, 11 (65%) had recurrent EPP liver disease. Posttransplantation treatment with hematin and plasmapheresis should be considered to prevent the recurrence of liver disease. Bone marrow transplantation, which has been successful in human EPP and prevents liver disease in a mouse model, should be considered after the liver transplantation, if a suitable donor can be found.

Chapter 359. Disorders of Purine and Pyrimidine Metabolism >
 

Disorders of Purine and Pyrimidine Metabolism: Introduction

Purines (adenine and guanine) and pyrimidines (cytosine, thymine, uracil) serve fundamental roles in the replication of genetic material, gene transcription, protein synthesis, and cellular metabolism. Disorders that involve abnormalities of nucleotide metabolism range from relatively common diseases such as hyperuricemia and gout, in which there is increased production or impaired excretion of a metabolic end product of purine metabolism (uric acid), to rare enzyme deficiencies that affect purine and pyrimidine synthesis or degradation. Understanding these biochemical pathways has led, in some instances, to the development of specific forms of treatment, such as the use of allopurinol, to reduce uric acid production.
 
Uric Acid Metabolism

Uric acid is the final breakdown product of purine degradation in humans. It is a weak acid with pKas of 5.75 and 10.3. Urates, the ionized forms of uric acid, predominate in plasma extracellular fluid and synovial fluid, with 98% existing as monosodium urate at pH 7.4.

Plasma is saturated with monosodium urate at a concentration of 405 mol/L (6.8 mg/dL) at 37∼C. At higher concentrations, plasma is therefore supersaturated, creating the potential for urate crystal precipitation. However, plasma urate concentrations can reach 4800 mol/L (80 mg/dL) without precipitation, perhaps because of the presence of solubilizing substances.

The pH of urine greatly influences the solubility of uric acid. At pH 5.0, urine is saturated with uric acid at concentrations ranging from 360 to 900 mol/L (6每15 mg/dL). At pH 7, saturation is reached at concentrations between 9480 and 12,000 mol/L (158 and 200 mg/dL). Ionized forms of uric acid in urine include mono- and disodium, potassium, ammonium, and calcium urates.

Although purine nucleotides are synthesized and degraded in all tissues, urate is produced only in tissues that contain xanthine oxidase, primarily the liver and small intestine. Urate production varies with the purine content of the diet and the rates of purine biosynthesis, degradation, and salvage (Fig. 359-1). Normally, two-thirds to three-fourths of urate is excreted by the kidneys, and most of the remainder is eliminated through the intestines.

Figure 359-1

 
 
 
The total-body urate pool is the net result between urate production and excretion. Urate production is influenced by dietary intake of purines and the rates of de novo biosynthesis of purines from nonpurine precursors, nucleic acid turnover, and salvage by phosphoribosyltransferase activities. The formed urate is normally excreted by urinary and intestinal routes. Hyperuricemia can result from increased production, decreased excretion, or a combination of both mechanisms. When hyperuricemia exists, urate can precipitate and deposit in tissues as tophi.
 
 


The kidneys clear urate from the plasma and maintain physiologic balance by utilizing specific organic anion transporters (OATs), including urate transporter 1 (URAT1) and human uric acid transporter (hUAT) (Fig. 359-2). URAT1 and other OATs carry urate into the tubular cells from the apical side of the lumen. Once inside the cell, urate must pass to the basolateral side of the lumen in a process controlled by the voltage-dependent carrier hUAT. Until recently, a four-component model has been used to describe the renal handling of urate/uric acid: (1) glomerular filtration, (2) tubular reabsorption, (3) secretion, and (4) postsecretory reabsorption. Although these processes have been considered sequential, it is now apparent that they are carried out in parallel by these transporters. URAT1 is a novel transporter expressed at the apical brush border of the proximal nephron. Uricosuric compounds (Table 359-1) directly inhibit URAT1 on the apical side of the tubular cell (so-called cis-inhibition). In contrast, antiuricosuric compounds (those that promote hyperuricemia), such as nicotinate, pyrazinoate, lactate, and other aromatic organic acids, serve as the exchange anion inside the cell, thereby stimulating anion exchange and urate reabsorption (trans-stimulation). The activities of URAT1, other OATs, and sodium anion transporter result in 8每12% of the filtered urate being excreted as uric acid.

A complex interplay of transporters on both the apical and basolateral aspects of the renal tubuleepithelial cell is involved in the reabsorption of uric acid. Please see text for details. Most uricosuric compounds inhibit URAT1 on the apical side, as well as OAT1, OAT3, and GLUT9 on the basolateral side.

Most children have serum urate concentrations of 180每 240 mol/L (3每4 mg/dL). Levels begin to rise in males during puberty but remain low in females until menopause. Mean serum urate values of adult men and premenopausal women are 415 and 360 mol/L (6.8 and 6 mg/dL), respectively. After menopause, values for women increase to approximate those of men. In adulthood, concentrations rise steadily over time and vary with height, body weight, blood pressure, renal function, and alcohol intake.
 
Hyperuricemia

Hyperuricemia can result from increased production or decreased excretion of uric acid or from a combination of the two processes. Sustained hyperuricemia predisposes some individuals to develop clinical manifestations including gouty arthritis (Chap. 333), urolithiasis, and renal dysfunction (see below).

Hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma (or serum) urate concentration >405 mol/L (6.8 mg/dL). The risk of developing gouty arthritis or urolithiasis increases with higher urate levels and escalates in proportion to the degree of elevation. Hyperuricemia is present in between 2 and 13.2% of ambulatory adults and is even more frequent in hospitalized individuals.

Causes of Hyperuricemia

Hyperuricemia may be classified as primary or secondary depending on whether the cause is innate or is the result of an acquired disorder. However, it is more useful to classify hyperuricemia in relation to the underlying pathophysiology, i.e., whether it results from increased production, decreased excretion, or a combination of the two (Fig. 359-1, Table 359-2).

Increased Urate Production

Diet contributes to the serum urate in proportion to its purine content. Strict restriction of purine intake reduces the mean serum urate level by about 60 mol/L (1 mg/dL) and urinary uric acid excretion by 1.2 mmol/d (200 mg/d). Foods high in nucleic acid content include liver, "sweetbreads" (i.e., thymus and pancreas), kidney, and anchovy.

Endogenous sources of purine production also influence the serum urate level (Fig. 359-3). De novo purine biosynthesis is an 11-step process that forms inosine monophosphate (IMP). The rates of purine biosynthesis and urate production are determined, for the most part, by amidophosphoribosyltransferase (amidoPRT), which combines phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) and glutamine. A secondary regulatory pathway is the salvage of purine bases by hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). HPRT catalyzes the combination of the purine bases hypoxanthine and guanine with PRPP to form the respective ribonucleotides IMP and guanosine monophosphate (GMP).

Serum urate levels are closely coupled to the rates of de novo purine biosynthesis, which is driven in part by the level of PRPP, as evidenced by two X-linked inborn errors of purine metabolism. Both increased PRPP synthetase activity and HPRT deficiency are associated with overproduction of purines, hyperuricemia, and hyperuricaciduria (see below for clinical descriptions).

Accelerated purine nucleotide degradation can also cause hyperuricemia, i.e., with conditions of rapid cell turnover, proliferation, or cell death, as in leukemic blast crises, cytotoxic therapy for malignancy, hemolysis, or rhabdomyolysis. Hyperuricemia can result from excessive degradation of skeletal muscle ATP after strenuous physical exercise or status epilepticus and in glycogen storage diseases types III, V, and VII (Chap. 362). The hyperuricemia of myocardial infarction, smoke inhalation, and acute respiratory failure may also be related to accelerated breakdown of ATP.

Decreased Uric Acid Excretion

More than 90% of individuals with sustained hyperuricemia have a defect in the renal handling of uric acid. Gouty individuals excrete 40% less uric acid than nongouty individuals for any given plasma urate concentration. Uric acid excretion increases in gouty and nongouty individuals when plasma urate levels are raised by purine ingestion or infusion, but in those with gout, plasma urate concentrations must be 60每120 mol/L (1每2 mg/dL) higher than normal to achieve equivalent uric acid excretion rates.

Altered uric acid excretion could theoretically result from decreased glomerular filtration, decreased tubular secretion, or enhanced tubular reabsorption. Decreased urate filtration does not appear to cause primary hyperuricemia but does contribute to the hyperuricemia of renal insufficiency. Although hyperuricemia is invariably present in chronic renal disease, the correlation between serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, and urate concentration is poor. Uric acid excretion per unit of glomerular filtration rate increases progressively with chronic renal insufficiency, but tubular secretory capacity tends to be preserved, tubular reabsorptive capacity is reduced, and extrarenal clearance of uric acid increases as renal damage becomes more severe.

Many agents that cause hyperuricemia exert their effects by stimulating reabsorption rather than inhibiting secretion. This appears to occur through a process of "priming" renal urate reabsorption through the sodium-dependent loading of proximal tubular epithelial cells with anions capable of trans-stimulating urate reabsorption. The sodium-coupled monocarboxyl transporters SMCT1 and 2 (SLC5A8, SLC5A12) in the brush border of the proximal tubular cells mediate sodium-dependent loading of these cells with monocarboxylates. A similar transporter, SLC13A3, mediates sodium-dependent influx of dicarboxylates into the epithelial cell from the basolateral membrane. Some of these carboxylates are well known to cause hyperuricemia, including pyrazinoate (from pyrazinamide treatment), nicotinate (from niacin therapy), and the organic acids lactate, -hydroxybutyrate, and acetoacetate. The mono- and divalent anions then become substrates for URAT1 and organic anion transporter (OAT4), respectively, and are exchanged for uric acid from the proximal tubule. Increased blood levels of these anions result in their increased glomerular filtration and greater reabsorption by proximal tubular cells. The increased intraepithelial cell concentrations lead to increased uric acid reabsorption by promoting URAT1- and OAT4-dependent anion exchange. Low doses of salicylates also promote hyperuricemia by this mechanism. Sodium loading of proximal tubular cells also provokes urate retention by reducing extracellular fluid volume and increasing angiotensin II, insulin, and parathyroid hormone release. Additional organic anion transporters OAT1 and OAT3 are involved in the movement of uric acid through the basolateral membrane, although the detailed mechanisms are still being elucidated.

Glucose transporter 9 (GLUT9, SLC2A9) is an electrogenic hexose transporter with splicing variants that mediate co-reabsorption of uric acid along with glucose and fructose at the apical membrane (GLUT9DN/SLC2A9v2), as well as through the basolateral membrane, and thus into the circulation (SLC2A9v1). This might be a mechanism for the observed association of the consumption of fructose-sweetened soft drinks with an increased risk of hyperuricemia and gout. Genomewide association scanning (GWAS) suggests that polymorphisms in SLC2A9 may play an important role in susceptibility to gout in the white population. The presence of one predisposing variant allele increases the relative risk of developing gout by 30每70%, most likely by increasing expression of the shorter isoform, SLC2A9v2 (GLUT9DN). Notably, these polymorphisms explain <5% of the variation in serum uric acid levels in whites.

Alcohol promotes hyperuricemia because of increased urate production and decreased uric acid excretion. Excessive alcohol consumption accelerates hepatic breakdown of ATP to increase urate production. Alcohol consumption can also induce hyperlacticacidemia, which blocks uric acid secretion. The higher purine content in some alcoholic beverages such as beer may also be a factor.

Evaluation

Hyperuricemia does not necessarily represent a disease, nor is it a specific indication for therapy. The decision to treat depends on the cause and the potential consequences of the hyperuricemia in each individual.

Quantification of uric acid excretion can be used to determine whether hyperuricemia is caused by overproduction or decreased excretion. On a purine-free diet, men with normal renal function excrete <3.6 mmol/d (600 mg/d). Thus, the hyperuricemia of individuals who excrete uric acid above this level while on a purine-free diet is due to purine overproduction; for those who excrete lower amounts on the purine-free diet, it is due to decreased excretion. If the assessment is performed while the patient is on a regular diet, the level of 4.2 mmol/d (800 mg/d) can be used as the discriminating value.

Complications

The most recognized complication of hyperuricemia is gouty arthritis. In the general population, the prevalence of hyperuricemia ranges between 2.0 and 13.2%, and the prevalence of gout is between 1.3 and 3.7%. The higher the serum urate level, the more likely an individual is to develop gout. In one study, the incidence of gout was 4.9% for individuals with serum urate concentrations >540 mol/L (9.0 mg/dL) compared with 0.5% for those with values between 415 and 535 mol/L (7.0 and 8.9 mg/dL). The complications of gout correlate with both the duration and severity of hyperuricemia. For further discussion of gout, see Chap. 333.

Hyperuricemia also causes several renal problems: (1) nephrolithiasis; (2) urate nephropathy, a rare cause of renal insufficiency attributed to monosodium urate crystal deposition in the renal interstitium; and (3) uric acid nephropathy, a reversible cause of acute renal failure resulting from deposition of large amounts of uric acid crystals in the renal collecting ducts, pelvis, and ureters.

Nephrolithiasis

Uric acid nephrolithiasis occurs most commonly, but not exclusively, in individuals with gout. In gout, the prevalence of nephrolithiasis correlates with the serum and urinary uric acid levels, reaching 50% with serum urate levels of 770 mol/L (13 mg/dL) or urinary uric acid excretion >6.5 mmol/d (1100 mg/d).

Uric acid stones can develop in individuals with no evidence of arthritis, only 20% of whom are hyperuricemic. Uric acid can also play a role in other types of kidney stones. Some nongouty individuals with calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate stones have hyperuricemia or hyperuricaciduria. Uric acid may act as a nidus on which calcium oxalate can precipitate or lower the formation product for calcium oxalate crystallization.

Urate Nephropathy

Urate nephropathy, sometimes referred to as urate nephrosis, is a late manifestation of severe gout and is characterized histologically by deposits of monosodium urate crystals surrounded by a giant cell inflammatory reaction in the medullary interstitium and pyramids. The disorder is now rare and cannot be diagnosed in the absence of gouty arthritis. The lesions may be clinically silent or cause proteinuria, hypertension, and renal insufficiency.

Uric Acid Nephropathy

This reversible cause of acute renal failure is due to precipitation of uric acid in renal tubules and collecting ducts that causes obstruction to urine flow. Uric acid nephropathy develops following sudden urate overproduction and marked hyperuricaciduria. Factors that favor uric acid crystal formation include dehydration and acidosis. This form of acute renal failure occurs most often during an aggressive "blastic" phase of leukemia or lymphoma prior to or coincident with cytolytic therapy but has also been observed in individuals with other neoplasms, following epileptic seizures, and after vigorous exercise with heat stress. Autopsy studies have demonstrated intraluminal precipitates of uric acid, dilated proximal tubules, and normal glomeruli. The initial pathogenic events are believed to include obstruction of collecting ducts with uric acid and obstruction of distal renal vasculature.

If recognized, uric acid nephropathy is potentially reversible. Appropriate therapy has reduced the mortality from about 50% to practically nil. Serum levels cannot be relied on for diagnosis because this condition has developed in the presence of urate concentrations varying from 720 to 4800 mol/L (12每80 mg/dL). The distinctive feature is the urinary uric acid concentration. In most forms of acute renal failure with decreased urine output, urinary uric acid content is either normal or reduced, and the ratio of uric acid to creatinine is <1. In acute uric acid nephropathy the ratio of uric acid to creatinine in a random urine sample or 24-h specimen is >1, and a value that high is essentially diagnostic.

Hyperuricemia and Metabolic Syndrome

Metabolic syndrome (Chap. 242) is characterized by abdominal obesity with visceral adiposity, impaired glucose tolerance due to insulin resistance with hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and hyperuricemia. Hyperinsulinemia reduces the renal excretion of uric acid and sodium. Not surprisingly, hyperuricemia resulting from euglycemic hyperinsulinemia may precede the onset of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and gout in individuals with metabolic syndrome.

Treatment: Hyperuricemia

Asymptomatic Hyperuricemia

Hyperuricemia is present in 5% of the population and in up to 25% of hospitalized individuals. The vast majority are at no clinical risk. In the past, the association of hyperuricemia with cardiovascular disease and renal failure led to the use of urate-lowering agents for patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia. This practice is no longer recommended except for individuals receiving cytolytic therapy for neoplastic disease, in which treatment is given in an effort to prevent uric acid nephropathy. Because hyperuricemia can be a component of the metabolic syndrome, its presence is an indication to screen for and aggressively treat any accompanying obesity, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension.

Hyperuricemic individuals are at risk to develop gouty arthritis, especially those with higher serum urate levels. However, most hyperuricemic persons never develop gout, and prophylactic treatment is not indicated. Furthermore, neither structural kidney damage nor tophi are identifiable before the first attack. Reduced renal function cannot be attributed to asymptomatic hyperuricemia, and treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia does not alter the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with renal disease. Increased risk of stone formation in those with asymptomatic hyperuricemia is not established.

Thus, because treatment with specific antihyperuricemic agents entails inconvenience, cost, and potential toxicity, routine treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia cannot be justified other than for prevention of acute uric acid nephropathy. In addition, routine screening for asymptomatic hyperuricemia is not recommended. If hyperuricemia is diagnosed, however, the cause should be determined. Causal factors should be corrected if the condition is secondary, and associated problems such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, and obesity should be treated.

Symptomatic Hyperuricemia

Nephrolithiasis

(See Chap. 333 for treatment of gout.) Antihyperuricemic therapy is recommended for the individual who has both gouty arthritis and either uric acid每 or calcium-containing stones, both of which may occur in association with hyperuricaciduria. Regardless of the nature of the calculi, fluid ingestion should be sufficient to produce a daily urine volume >2 L. Alkalinization of the urine with sodium bicarbonate or acetazolamide may be justified to increase the solubility of uric acid. Specific treatment of uric acid calculi requires reducing the urine uric acid concentration with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, such as allopurinol or febuxostat. These agents decrease the serum urate concentration and the urinary excretion of uric acid in the first 24 h, with a maximum reduction occurring within 2 weeks. The average effective dose of allopurinol is 300每400 mg/d. Allopurinol can be given once a day because of the long half-life (18 h) of its active metabolite, oxypurinol. The drug is effective in patients with renal insufficiency, but the dose should be reduced. Allopurinol is also useful in reducing the recurrence of calcium oxalate stones in gouty patients and in nongouty individuals with hyperuricemia or hyperuricaciduria. Febuxostat (40每80 mg/d) is also taken once daily, and doses do not need to be adjusted in the presence of mild to moderate renal dysfunction. Potassium citrate (30每80 mmol/d orally in divided doses) is an alternative therapy for patients with uric acid stones alone or mixed calcium/uric acid stones. A xanthine oxidase inhibitor is also indicated for the treatment of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine kidney stones.

Uric Acid Nephropathy

Uric acid nephropathy is often preventable, and immediate, appropriate therapy has greatly reduced the mortality rate. Vigorous IV hydration and diuresis with furosemide dilute the uric acid in the tubules and promote urine flow to 100 mL/h. The administration of acetazolamide, 240每500 mg every 6每8 h, and sodium bicarbonate, 89 mmol/L, IV enhances urine alkalinity and thereby solubilizes more uric acid. It is important to ensure that the urine pH remains >7.0 and to watch for circulatory overload. In addition, antihyperuricemic therapy in the form of allopurinol in a single dose of 8 mg/kg is administered to reduce the amount of urate that reaches the kidney. If renal insufficiency persists, subsequent daily doses should be reduced to 100每200 mg because oxypurinol, the active metabolite of allopurinol, accumulates in renal failure. Despite these measures, hemodialysis may be required. Urate oxidase (Rasburicase) can also be administered IV to prevent or to treat tumor lysis syndrome.
 
Hypouricemia

Hypouricemia, defined as a serum urate concentration <120 mol/L (2.0 mg/dL) can result from decreased production of urate, increased excretion of uric acid, or a combination of both mechanisms. It occurs in <0.2% of the general population and <0.8% of hospitalized individuals. Hypouricemia causes no symptoms or pathology and therefore requires no therapy.

Most hypouricemia results from increased renal uric acid excretion. The finding of normal amounts of uric acid in a 24-h urine collection in an individual with hypouricemia is evidence for a renal cause. Medications with uricosuric properties (Table 359-1) include aspirin (at doses >2.0 g/d), losartan, fenofibrate, x-ray contrast materials, and glyceryl guaiacolate. Total parenteral hyperalimentation can also cause hypouricemia, possibly a result of the high glycine content of the infusion formula. Other causes of increased urate clearance include conditions such as neoplastic disease, hepatic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and inappropriate secretion of vasopressin; defects in renal tubular transport such as primary Fanconi syndrome and Fanconi syndromes caused by Wilson's disease, cystinosis, multiple myeloma, and heavy metal toxicity; and isolated congenital defects in the bidirectional transport of uric acid. Hypouricemia can be familial, generally inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Most cases are caused by a loss of function mutation in SLC12A12, the gene that encodes URAT-1, resulting in increased renal urate clearance. Individuals with normal SLC12A12 most likely have a defect in other urate transporters. Although usually asymptomatic, some patients suffer from urate nephrolithiasis or exercise-induced renal failure.
 
Selected Inborn Errors of Purine Metabolism

(See also Table 359-3, Fig. 359-3.) More than 30 defects in human purine and pyrimidine metabolic pathways have been identified thus far. Many are benign, but about half are associated with clinical manifestations, some causing major morbidity and mortality. Advances in genetics, as well as high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry, have allowed for better diagnosis.

Purine Disorders

Hprt Deficiency

The HPRT gene is located on the X chromosome. Affected males are hemizygous for the mutant gene; carrier females are asymptomatic. A complete deficiency of HPRT, the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, is characterized by hyperuricemia, self-mutilative behavior, choreoathetosis, spasticity, and mental retardation. A partial deficiency of HPRT, the Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome, is associated with hyperuricemia but no central nervous system manifestations. In both disorders, the hyperuricemia results from urate overproduction and can cause uric acid crystalluria, nephrolithiasis, obstructive uropathy, and gouty arthritis. Early diagnosis and appropriate therapy with allopurinol can prevent or eliminate all the problems attributable to hyperuricemia but have no effect on the behavioral or neurologic abnormalities.

Increased Prpp Synthetase Activity

Like the HPRT deficiency states, PRPP synthetase overactivity is X-linked and results in gouty arthritis and uric acid nephrolithiasis. Nerve deafness occurs in some families.

Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase (Aprt) Deficiency

APRT deficiency is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Affected individuals develop kidney stones composed of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine. Whites with the disorder have a complete deficiency (type I), whereas Japanese subjects have some measurable enzyme activity (type II). Expression of the defect is similar in the two populations, as is the frequency of the heterozygous state (0.4每1.1 per 100). Allopurinol treatment prevents stone formation.

Hereditary Xanthinuria

A deficiency of xanthine oxidase causes all purine in the urine to occur in the form of hypoxanthine and xanthine. About two-thirds of deficient individuals are asymptomatic. The remainder develop kidney stones composed of xanthine.

Myoadenylate Deaminase Deficiency

Primary (inherited) and secondary (acquired) forms of myoadenylate deaminase deficiency have been described. The primary form is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Clinically, some may have relatively mild myopathic symptoms with exercise or other triggers, but most individuals with this defect are asymptomatic. Therefore, another explanation for the myopathy should be sought in symptomatic patients with this deficiency. The acquired deficiency occurs in association with a wide variety of neuromuscular disease, including muscular dystrophies, neuropathies, inflammatory myopathies, and collagen vascular diseases.

Adenylosuccinate Lyase Deficiency

Deficiency of this enzyme is due to an autosomal recessive trait and causes profound psychomotor retardation, seizures, and other movement disorders. All individuals with this deficiency are mentally retarded, and most are autistic.

Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency and Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase Deficiency

See Chap. 316.
 
Pyrimidine Disorders

The pyrimidine cytidine is found in both DNA and RNA; it is a complementary base pair for guanine. Thymidine is found only in DNA, where it is paired with adenine. Uridine is found only in RNA and can pair with either adenine or guanine in RNA secondary structures. Pyrimidines can be synthesized by a de novo pathway (Fig. 359-4) or reused in a salvage pathway. Although >25 different enzymes are involved in pyrimidine metabolism, disorders of these pathways are rare. Seven disorders of pyrimidine metabolism have been discovered (Table 359-4), three of which are discussed below.

Ureidopropionase Deficiency Uncertain Hypotonia, dystonia, developmental delay High urinary excretion of N-carbamyl--alanine and N-carbamyl -aminoisobutyric acid 
 

 

Orotic Aciduria

Hereditary orotic aciduria is caused by mutations in a bifunctional enzyme, uridine-5'-monophosphate (UMP) synthase, which converts orotic acid to UMP in the de novo synthesis pathway (Fig. 359-4). The disorder is characterized by hypochromic megaloblastic anemia that is unresponsive to vitamin B12 and folic acid, growth retardation, and neurologic abnormalities. Increased excretion of orotic acid causes crystalluria and obstructive uropathy. Replacement of uridine (100每200 mg/kg per day) corrects the anemia, reduces orotic acid excretion, and improves the other sequelae of the disorder.

Pyrimidine 5'-Nucleotidase Deficiency

Pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase catalyzes the removal of the phosphate group from pyrimidine ribonucleoside monophosphates (cytidine-5'-monophosphate or UMP) (Fig. 359-4). An inherited deficiency of this enzyme causes hemolytic anemia with prominent basophilic stippling of erythrocytes. The accumulation of pyrimidines or cytidine diphosphate choline (CDPC) is thought to induce hemolysis. There is no specific treatment. Acquired pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase deficiency has been reported in lead poisoning and in thalassemia.

Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase Deficiency

Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway of uracil and thymine degradation (Fig. 359-4). Deficiency of this enzyme causes excessive urinary excretion of uracil and thymine. DPD deficiency causes nonspecific cerebral dysfunction with convulsive disorders, motor retardation, and mental retardation. No specific treatment is available.

Medication Effects on Pyrimidine Metabolism

A variety of medications can influence pyrimidine metabolism. The anticancer agents fluorodeoxyuridine and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and the antimicrobial agent fluorocytosine cause cytotoxicity when converted to fluorodeoxyuridylate (FdUMP), a specific suicide inhibitor of thymidylate synthase. Fluorocytosine must be converted to 5-FU to be effective. This conversion is catalyzed by cytosine deaminase activity. Fluorocytosine's action is selective because cytosine deaminase is present in bacteria and fungi but not in human cells.

DPD is involved in the degradation of 5-FU. Consequently, deficiency of this enzyme is associated with 5-FU neurotoxicity.

Leflunomide, which is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, inhibits de novo pyrimidine synthesis by inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, resulting in an antiproliferative effect on T cells. Allopurinol, which is used to block xanthine oxidase and purine synthesis, also inhibits orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase, a step in UMP synthesis. Consequently, allopurinol use is associated with increased excretion of orotidine and orotic acid; there are no known clinical effects of this inhibition.

 Chapter 360. Wilson's Disease >
 

Wilson's Disease: Introduction

Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, a membrane-bound, copper-transporting ATPase. Clinical manifestations are caused by copper toxicity and primarily involve the liver and the brain. Because effective treatment is available, it is important to make this diagnosis early.

The frequency of Wilson's disease in most populations is about 1 in 30,000每40,000, and the frequency of carriers of ATP7B mutations is 1%. Siblings of a diagnosed patient have a 1 in 4 risk of Wilson's disease, whereas children of an affected patient have about a 1 in 200 risk. Because a large number of inactivating mutations have been reported in the ATP7B gene, mutation screening for diagnosis is not routine, although this may be practical in the future. DNA haplotype analysis can be used to genotype siblings of an affected patient.

Pathogenesis

ATP7B protein deficiency impairs biliary copper excretion, resulting in positive copper balance, hepatic copper accumulation, and copper toxicity from oxidant damage. Excess hepatic copper is initially bound to metallothionein, but as this storage capacity is exceeded, liver damage begins as early as three years of age. Defective copper incorporation into apoceruloplasmin leads to excess catabolism and low blood levels of ceruloplasmin. Serum copper levels are usually lower than normal because of low blood ceruloplasmin, which normally binds >90% of serum copper. As the disease progresses, nonceruloplasmin serum copper ("free" copper) levels increase, resulting in copper buildup in other parts of the body, such as the brain, leading to neurologic and psychiatric disease.

Clinical Presentation

Hepatic

Wilson's disease may present as hepatitis, cirrhosis, or as hepatic decompensation, typically in the mid to late teenage years in western countries, although the age of presentation is quite broad and extends into the fifth decade of life.

An episode of hepatitis may occur, with elevated blood transaminase enzymes, with or without jaundice, and then spontaneously regress. Hepatitis often reoccurs, and most of these patients eventually develop cirrhosis.

Hepatic decompensation is associated with elevated serum bilirubin, reduced serum albumin and coagulation factors, ascites, peripheral edema, and hepatic encephalopathy. In severe hepatic failure, hemolytic anemia may occur because large amounts of copper derived from hepatocellular necrosis are released into the bloodstream. The association of hemolysis and liver disease makes Wilson's disease a likely diagnosis.

Neurologic

The neurologic manifestations of Wilson's disease typically occur in patients in their early twenties, although the age of onset extends into the sixth decade of life. MRI and CT scans reveal damage in the basal ganglia and occasionally in the pons, medulla, thalamus, cerebellum, and subcortical areas. The three main movement disorders include dystonia, incoordination, and tremor. Dysarthria and dysphagia are common. In some patients, the clinical picture closely resembles that of Parkinson's disease. Dystonia can involve any part of the body and eventually leads to grotesque positions of the limbs, neck, and trunk. Autonomic disturbances may include orthostatic hypotension and sweating abnormalities as well as bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction. Memory loss, migraine-type headaches, and seizures may occur. Patients have difficulties focusing on tasks, but cognition is not usually grossly impaired. Sensory abnormalities and muscular weakness are not features of the disease.

Psychiatric

A history of behavioral disturbances, with onset in the five years before diagnosis, is present in half of patients with neurologic disease. The features are diverse and may include loss of emotional control (temper tantrums, crying bouts), depression, hyperactivity, or loss of sexual inhibition.

Other Manifestations

Some female patients have repeated spontaneous abortions, and most become amenorrheic prior to diagnosis. Cholelithiasis and nephrolithiasis occur with increased frequency. Some patients have osteoarthritis, particularly of the knee. Microscopic hematuria is common, and increased urinary excretion of phosphates, amino acids, glucose, or urates may occur; however, a full-blown Fanconi syndrome is rare. Sunflower cataracts and Kayser-Fleischer rings (copper deposits in the outer rim of the cornea) may be seen. Electrocardiographic and other cardiac abnormalities have been reported but are not common.

Diagnosis

Diagnostic tests for Wilson's disease are listed in Table 360-1. Serum ceruloplasmin levels should not be used for definitive diagnosis, because they are normal in up to 10% of affected patients and are reduced in 20% of carriers. Kayser-Fleischer rings (Fig. 360-1) can only be diagnosed definitively by an ophthalmologist using a slit lamp. They are present in >99% of patients with neurologic/psychiatric forms of the disease and have been described very rarely in the absence of Wilson's disease. Kayser-Fleischer rings are present in only 30每50% of patients diagnosed in the hepatic or presymptomatic state; thus, the absence of rings does not exclude the diagnosis.

Urine copper is an important diagnostic tool, but it must be collected carefully to avoid contamination. Symptomatic patients invariably have urine copper levels > 1.6 mmol (>100 mg) per 24 h. Heterozygotes have values < 1.3 mmol (<80 mg) per 24 h. About half of presymptomatic patients who are ultimately affected have diagnostically elevated urine copper values, but the other half are in an intermediate range between 0.9 and 1.6 mmol (60 and 100 mg) per 24 h. Because heterozygotes may have values up to 1.3 mmol (80 mg) per 24 h, patients in this range may require a liver biopsy for definitive diagnosis.

The gold standard for diagnosis remains liver biopsy with quantitative copper assays. Affected patients have values > 3.1 mmol/g (> 200 mg/g dry weight of liver). Copper stains are not reliable. False-positive results can occur with long-standing obstructive liver disease, which can elevate hepatic and urine copper and rarely causes Kayser-Fleischer rings.

Treatment: Wilson's Disease

Recommended anticopper treatments are listed in Table 360-2. Penicillamine was previously the primary anticopper treatment but now plays a minor role because of its toxicity and because it often worsens existing neurologic disease if used as initial therapy. If penicillamine is given, it should always be accompanied by 25 mg/d of pyridoxine. Trientine is a less toxic chelator and is supplanting penicillamine when a chelator is indicated.

aZinc acetate is supplied as Galzin, manufactured by Gate Pharmaceutical. Recommended adult dose for all the above indications is 50 mg of elemental zinc three times daily, each dose separated from food and beverages other than water by at least 1 h, and separated from trientine or penicillamine doses by at least 1 h.

bTrientine is supplied as Syprine and penicillamine as Cuprimine, both manufactured by Merck. Recommended adult dosage for both drugs is 500 mg twice daily, each dose at least 1/2 h before or 2 h after meals.

cTetrathiomolybdate is being studied in clinical trials.
 

For patients with hepatitis or cirrhosis, but without evidence of hepatic decompensation or neurologic/psychiatric symptoms, zinc is the therapy of choice, although some advocate therapy with trientine. Zinc has proven efficacy in Wilson's disease and is essentially nontoxic. It produces a negative copper balance by blocking intestinal absorption of copper, and it induces hepatic metallothionein synthesis, which sequesters additional toxic copper. All presymptomatic patients should be treated prophylactically, because the disease is close to 100% penetrant.

The first step in evaluating patients presenting with hepatic decompensation is to establish disease severity, which can be estimated using the Nazer prognostic index (Table 360-3). Patients with scores < 7 can usually be managed with medical therapy. Patients with scores > 9 should be considered immediately for liver transplantation, and those with scores between 7 and 9 require clinical judgment as to whether to recommend transplantation or medical therapy. A combination of trientine and zinc has been used to treat patients with Nazer scores as high as 9, but such patients should be watched carefully for indications of hepatic deterioration, which mandates transplantation.

For initial medical therapy of patients with hepatic decompensation, a chelator (trientine is preferred) plus zinc is recommended (Table 360-2). Zinc should not, however, be ingested simultaneously with trientine, because it will chelate zinc and form therapeutically ineffective complexes; administration of the two drugs should be separated by at least one hour.

For initial neurologic therapy, tetrathiomolybdate is emerging as the drug of choice because of its rapid control of free copper, preservation of neurologic function, and low toxicity. Penicillamine and trientine should be avoided because they each have a high risk of worsening the neurologic condition. Until tetrathiomolybdate is commercially available, zinc therapy is recommended. Although it is relatively slow-acting, zinc itself does not cause neurologic worsening. Although hepatic transplantation may improve neurologic symptoms, it does so only by removing copper, which can be done more safely and inexpensively with anticopper drugs. Pregnant patients should be treated with zinc or trientine throughout pregnancy, but without tight copper control, because copper deficiency can be teratogenic.

Anticopper therapy must be lifelong. With treatment, liver function usually recovers after about a year, although residual liver damage is usually present. Neurologic and psychiatric symptoms usually improve after 6 to 24 months of treatment.

Monitoring Anticopper Therapy

When first using trientine or penicillamine, it is necessary to monitor for drug toxicity〞particularly bone marrow suppression and proteinuria. Complete blood counts, standard biochemical profiles, and a urinalysis should be performed at weekly intervals for a month, then at twice-weekly intervals for two to three months, then at monthly intervals for three or four months, and at four- to six-month intervals thereafter.

The anticopper effects of trientine and penicillamine can be monitored by following 24-h "free" serum copper. Changes in urine copper are more difficult to interpret because excretion reflects the effect of the drug, as well as body loading with copper. Free serum copper is calculated by subtracting the ceruloplasmin copper from the total serum copper. Each 10 mg/L (mg/dL) of ceruloplasmin contributes 0.5 mmol/L (3 mg/dL) of serum copper. The normal free copper value is 1.6每2.4 mmol/L (10每15 mg/dL), and it is often as high as 7.9 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) in untreated Wilson's disease. With treatment, free copper should be <3.9 mmol/L (<25 mg/dL).

Zinc treatment does not require blood or urine monitoring for toxicity. Its only significant side effect is gastric burning or nausea in 10% of patients, usually with the first morning dose. This can be mitigated by taking the first dose an hour after breakfast or taking the zinc with a small amount of protein. Because zinc mainly affects stool copper, 24-h urine copper can be used to reflect body loading. The typical value in untreated symptomatic patients is >3.1 mmol (>200 mg) per 24 h. This level should decrease during the first 1每2 years of therapy to <2.0 mmol (<125 mg) per 24 h. A normal value [0.3 to 0.8 mmol (20 to 50 mg)] is rarely reached during the first decade of therapy and should raise concern about overtreatment (copper deficiency), the first sign of which is anemia and/or leukopenia.
 
Global Considerations

Age of onset of clinical disease may be considerably younger in India and far Eastern countries, often occurring in children only five or six years of age. The incidence of the disease may be increased in certain populations due to founder effects. For example, in Sardinia, the incidence may be 1 in 3000. In countries where penicillamine, trientine, and zinc acetate (as Galzin) are not available or cannot be afforded, zinc salts such as the gluconate or sulfate provide an alternative treatment option.

 Chapter 361. Lysosomal Storage Diseases >
 

Lysosomal Storage Diseases: Introduction

Lysosomes are heterogeneous subcellular organelles containing specific hydrolyses that allow selective processing or degradation of proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. There are >40 different lysosomal storage diseases, classified based on the nature of the stored material (Table 361-1). Several of the most prevalent disorders are reviewed here, including Tay-Sachs disease, Fabry's disease, Gaucher's disease, Niemann-Pick disease, the mucopolysaccharidosis, and Pompe's disease. Lysosomal storage diseases should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with neurologic, renal, or muscular degeneration and/or unexplained hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, cardiomyopathy, or skeletal dysplasias and deformations. Physical findings are disease-specific, and enzyme assays or genetic testing can be used to make a definitive diagnosis. Although the nosology of these diseases segregates the variants into distinct phenotypes, these are heuristic and, in the clinic, each disease exhibits, more or less, a continuous spectrum of manifestations from severe to attenuated variants.

Pathogenesis of Lysosomal Storage Diseases

Lysosomal biogenesis involves ongoing synthesis of lysosomal hydrolases, membrane constitutive proteins, and new membranes. Lysosomes originate from the fusion of trans-Golgi network (TGN) vesicles with late endosomes. Progressive vesicular acidification accompanies the maturation of TGN vesicles, and this gradient facilitates the pH-dependent dissociation of receptors and ligands, as well as activating lysosomal hydrolases.

Abnormalities at any biosynthetic step can impair enzyme activation and lead to a lysosomal storage disorder. Following leader sequence clipping, complex oligosaccharide modifications occur during transit through the Golgi, including the lysosomal targeting ligand, mannose-6-phosphate, and modification of high-mannose oligosaccharide chains of many soluble lysosomal hydrolases. Lysosomal integral or associated membrane proteins are sorted to the membrane or interior of the lysosome by several different peptide signals. Phosphorylation, sulfation, additional proteolytic processing, and macromolecular assembly of heteromers occur concurrently. Such posttranslational modifications are critical to enzyme function, and defects can result in multiple enzyme/protein deficiencies.

The final common pathway for lysosomal storage diseases is the accumulation of specific macromolecules within tissues and cells that normally have a high flux of these substrates. The majority of lysosomal enzyme deficiencies result from point mutations or genetic rearrangements at a locus that encodes a single lysosomal hydrolase. However, some mutations cause deficiencies of several different lysosomal hydrolases by altering the enzymes/proteins involved in targeting, active site modifications, or macromolecular association or trafficking. All are inherited as autosomal recessive disorders, except Hunter's (mucopolysaccharidosis type II) and Fabry's diseases, which are X-linked. Substrate accumulation leads to lysosomal distortion, which has significant pathologic consequences. In addition, abnormal amounts of metabolites may also have pharmacologic effects important to disease pathophysiology and propagation.

For many lysosomal diseases, the accumulated substrates are endogenously synthesized within particular tissue sites of pathology. Other diseases have greater exogenous substrate supplies. For example, they are delivered by low-density lipoprotein receptor每mediated uptake in Fabry's and cholesteryl ester storage diseases or by phagocytosis in Gaucher's disease type 1. The threshold hypothesis refers to a level of enzyme activity below which disease develops. Consequently, small changes in enzyme activity near the threshold can lead to or prevent disease. A critical element of this model is that enzymatic activity can be challenged by changes in substrate flux based on genetic background, cell turnover, recycling, or metabolic demands. Thus, a set level of residual enzyme may be adequate for substrate in some tissues or cells, but not in others. In addition, several variants of each lysosomal storage disease exist at a clinical level. These disorders, therefore, represent a continuum of manifestations that are not easily dissociated into discrete entities. The bases for such variations have not been elucidated in any detail.
 
Selected Disorders

Tay-Sachs Disease

About 1 in 30 Ashkenazi Jews is a carrier for Tay-Sachs disease, which is caused by total hexosaminidase A (Hex A) deficiency〞defective a-chains. The infantile form is a fatal neurodegenerative disease with macrocephaly, loss of motor skills, increased startle reaction, and a macular cherry red spot. The juvenile-onset form presents with ataxia and dementia, with death by age 10每15 years. The adult-onset disorder is characterized by clumsiness in childhood; progressive motor weakness in adolescence; and additional spinocerebellar, lower motor neuron symptoms, and dysarthria in adulthood. Intelligence declines slowly, and psychosis is common. Screening for Tay-Sachs disease carriers is recommended in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Sandhoff's disease, defective b-chains, is phenotypically similar to Tay-Sachs disease, but hepatosplenomegaly and bony dysplasias are also present.

Fabry's Disease

Fabry's disease is an X-linked disorder that results from mutations in the a-galactosidase gene. The estimated prevalence of hemizygous males is 1/40,000 to 1/3500 in selected populations. Clinically, the disease manifests with angiokeratomas (telangiectatic skin lesions), hypohidrosis, corneal and lenticular opacities, acroparesthesia; and small-vessel disease of the kidney, heart, and brain.

The angiokeratomas and acroparesthesia may appear in childhood and lead to early diagnosis, if suspected. Angiokeratomas are punctate, dark red to blue-black, flat or slightly raised, and usually symmetric; they do not blanch with pressure. They range from barely visible to several millimeters in diameter and have a tendency to increase in size and number with age. They usually are most dense between the umbilicus and knees〞the "bathing suit area"〞but may occur anywhere, including the mucosal surfaces. Angiokeratomas also occur in Fordyce scrotal angiokeratoma and several other very rare lysosomal storage diseases. Corneal and lenticular lesions, detectable on slit-lamp examination, may help in establishing a diagnosis of Fabry's disease. Debilitating episodic burning pain of the hands, feet, and proximal extremities (acroparesthesia) can last from minutes to days and can be precipitated by changes in temperature, exercise, fatigue, or fever. Abdominal pain can resemble that from appendicitis or renal colic. Proteinuria, isosthenuria, and progressive renal dysfunction occur in the second to fourth decades; about 5% of idiopathic renal failure males have a-galactosidase mutations. Hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, anginal chest pain with or without myocardial ischemia or infarction, and congestive heart failure can occur in the third to fourth decades. About 1每3% of patients with idiopathic hypertrophic myocardiopathy were found to have Fabry's disease. Similarly, 3每5% of idiopathic stroke in males (35每50 years) have a-galactosidase mutations. Leg lymphedema without hypoproteinemia and episodic diarrhea also occur. Death is due to renal failure or cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease in untreated patients. Variants with residual a-galactosidase activity may have late-onset manifestations limited to the cardiovascular system that resemble hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Variants with predominant cardiac, renal, or central nervous system (CNS) manifestations are becoming better defined. Up to 70% of heterozygous females may exhibit clinical manifestations, including acroparesthesia and CNS, cardiac, and renal disease.

Phenytoin and carbamazepine diminish the chronic and episodic acroparesthesia. Chronic hemodialysis or kidney transplantation can be lifesaving in patients with renal failure. Enzyme therapy clears stored lipids from a variety of cells, particularly those of the renal, cardiac, and skin vascular endothelium. Renal insufficiency appears irreversible. Early institution of enzyme therapy may prevent or slow the progression of the life-threatening complications.

Gaucher's Disease

Gaucher's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder that results from defective activity of acid b-glucosidase; >400 mutations have been described at the GBA locus of such patients. Disease variants are classified based on the absence or presence and progression of neuronopathic involvement.

Gaucher's disease type 1 is a nonneuronopathic disease that can present in childhood to adulthood with slowly to rapidly progressive visceral disease. About 55每60% of such patients are diagnosed at <20 years in white populations and even younger in other groups. This pattern of presentation is distinctly bimodal, with peaks at <10 to 15 years and at 25 years. Younger patients tend to have a greater degree of hepatosplenomegaly and accompanying blood cytopenias. In contrast, the older group has a greater tendency for chronic bone disease. Hepatosplenomegaly occurs in virtually all symptomatic patients and can be minor or massive. Accompanying anemia and thrombocytopenia are variable and are not directly related to liver or spleen volumes. Severe liver dysfunction is unusual. Splenic infarctions can resemble an acute abdomen. Pulmonary hypertension and alveolar Gaucher's cell accumulation are uncommon, but life threatening, and can occur at any age. GBA mutations in the hetero- or homozygous states are a significant risk factor for early onset or more progressive Parkinson's disease.

All patients with Gaucher's disease have nonuniform infiltration of bone marrow by lipid-laden macrophages termed Gaucher's cells. This can lead to marrow packing with subsequent infarction, ischemia, necrosis, and cortical bone destruction. Bone marrow involvement spreads from proximal to distal in the limbs and can involve the axial skeleton extensively, causing vertebral collapse. In addition to bone marrow involvement, bone remodeling is defective, with loss of total bone calcium leading to osteopenia, osteonecrosis, avascular infarction, and vertebral compression fractures and spinal cord involvement. Aseptic necrosis of the femoral head is common, as is fracture of the femoral neck. The mechanism by which diseased bone marrow macrophages interact with osteoclasts and/or osteoblasts to cause bone disease is not well understood. Chronic, ill-defined bone pain can be debilitating and poorly correlated with radiographic findings. "Bone crises" are associated with localized, excruciating pain, and, on occasion, local erythema, fever, and leukocytosis. Some patients have frequent crises, whereas other patients experience only one. These crises represent acute infarctions of bone, as evidenced in nuclear scans by localized absent uptake of pyrophosphate agents. Osteomyelitis should be excluded by appropriate cultures.

Decreased acid b-glucosidase activity (0每20% of normal) in nucleated cells makes the diagnosis. The enzyme is not present in bodily fluids. The sensitivity of enzyme testing is poor for heterozygote detection; molecular testing is preferred when the mutations are known. The disease frequency varies from about 1 in 1000 in Ashkenazi Jews to <1 in 100,000 in other populations. About 1 in 12每15 Ashkenazi Jews carries a Gaucher's disease allele. Four common mutations account for 85% of the mutations in that population of affected patients: N370S (1226G), 84GG (a G insertion at cDNA position 84), L444P (1448C), and IVS-2 (an intron 2 splice junction mutation).

Genotype/phenotype studies indicate a significant correlation, though not absolute, between disease type and severity and the acid b-glucosidase genotype. The most common mutation in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (N370S) shares a 100% association with nonneuronopathic or type 1 Gaucher's disease. The N370S/N370S and N370S/other mutant allelegenotypes are associated with later onset/less severe disease and with earlier onset/severe disease, respectively. As many as 50每60% of individuals with the N370S/N370S genotype are asymptomatic. Other alleles include L444P (very low activity), 84GG (null), or IVS-2 (null), and rare/private or uncharacterized alleles. The L444P/L444P patients almost always have life-threatening to very severe/early-onset disease, and many, though not all, develop CNS involvement in the first 2 decades of life.

Symptomatic management of the blood cytopenias and joint replacement surgeries continue to have important roles in management. However, regular, intravenous enzyme therapy is currently the treatment of choice in significantly affected patients and is highly efficacious and safe in diminishing the hepatosplenomegaly and improving bone marrow involvement and hematologic findings. The bone disease is decreased but not eliminated by enzyme therapy. Adult patients may benefit from adjunctive treatment with bisphosphonates to improve bone density. Patients who cannot be treated with enzyme, either because it is not effective or because they have an allergy or other hypersensitivities, may be treated with medications that decrease the production of the complex lipid molecules that are broken down by acid b-glucosidase (so-called, substrate reduction therapy). Other approaches to stabilize the abnormal enzyme produced by mutant alleles allowing improved enzyme function (referred to as pharmacologic chaperone therapy) are under investigation as alternative treatments for Gaucher's disease, Fabry's disease, and other lysosomal diseases.

Gaucher's disease type 2 is a rare, severe CNS disease that leads to death by 2 years of age. Type 3 Gaucher's disease has highly variable manifestations in the CNS and viscera. It can present in early childhood with rapidly progressive, massive visceral disease and slowly progresses to static CNS involvement; in adolescence with dementia; or in early adulthood with rapidly progressive, uncontrollable myoclonic seizures and mild visceral disease. Visceral disease in type 3 is nearly identical to that in type 1 but is generally more severe. Early CNS findings may be limited to defects in lateral gaze tracking, which may remain static for decades. Mental retardation can be slowly progressive or static. This variant is most frequent among individuals of Swedish descent. The visceral, but not the CNS, involvement responds to enzyme therapy.

Niemann-Pick Disease

This is an autosomal recessive disorder that results from defects in acid sphingomyelinase. Types A and B are distinguished by an early age of onset and progressive CNS disease in type A. Type A typically has onset in the first 6 months, with rapidly progressive CNS deterioration, spasticity, failure to thrive, and massive hepatosplenomegaly. In contrast, type B has a later, more variable onset and progression of hepatosplenomegaly, with eventual development of cirrhosis and hepatic replacement by foam cells. Affected patients develop progressive pulmonary disease with dyspnea, hypoxemia, and a reticular infiltrative pattern on chest x-ray. Foam cells are present in alveoli, lymphatic vessels, and pulmonary arteries. Progressive hepatic or lung disease leads to demise in adolescence to early adulthood.

The diagnosis is established by markedly decreased (1每10% of normal) sphingomyelinase activity in nucleated cells. There is no specific treatment for Niemann-Pick disease. The efficacy of hepatic or bone marrow transplantation has not been clearly established. Clinical trials using enzyme therapy are anticipated in the near future.

Mucopolysaccharidoses

Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of a-L-iduronidase. The continuum of involvement traditionally has been divided into three categories: (1) Hurler's disease (MPS I H) for severe deficiency with neurodegeneration, (2) Scheie's disease (MPS I S) for later-onset disease without neurologic involvement and with relatively less severe disease in other organ systems, and (3) Hurler-Scheie syndrome (MPS I H/S) for patients intermediate between these extremes. MPS I H/S is characterized by severe somatic disease and usually without overt neurologic deterioration.

MPS I often presents in infancy or early childhood with chronic rhinitis, clouding of the corneas, and hepatosplenomegaly. As the disease progresses, nearly every organ system can be affected. For the more severe forms, cardiac and respiratory diseases become life threatening in childhood. Skeletal disease can be quite severe, resulting in very limited mobility.

There are two current treatments for the MPS I diseases. Stem cell transplantation is the standard treatment for patients presenting in infancy who appear to have or are at risk for neurologic degeneration. Stem cell engraftment results in stabilization of the CNS disease and reverses the hepatosplenomegaly. It also improves the cardiac and respiratory disease. Stem cell transplantation does not eliminate the corneal disease or resolve the progressive skeletal disease. Intravenous enzyme therapy effectively addresses the hepatosplenomegaly and improves cardiac and respiratory disease. The enzyme does not effectively penetrate the CNS and does not directly alter the CNS disease. Enzyme therapy and stem cell transplant appear to have similar effects for signs and symptoms outside the CNS. Enzyme therapy has a lower risk for life-threatening complications and may, therefore, have advantages for patients without CNS degeneration. A combination of enzyme therapy and stem cell transplantation has been used with enzyme therapy started prior to transplantation in an attempt to decrease the disease burden prior to transplantation. The experience with this approach is not well documented, but it appears to have advantages over stem cell therapy alone.

Enzyme therapy for Maroteaux-Lamy disease (MPS VI) has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for treatment. This very rare autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, bone disease, heart disease, and respiratory compromise similar to those seen in MPS I, but it is due to deficiency of arylsulfatase B and is not associated with neurologic degeneration.

Hunter's disease (MPS II) is an X-linked disorder due to deficiency in iduronate sulfate sulfatase; it has manifestations similar to MPS I, including neurologic degeneration, but there is no corneal clouding or other eye disease. Like MPS I, MPS II is clinically variable with CNS and non-CNS variants. Stem cell transplantation has not been successful in treating the CNS disease associated with MPS II. The FDA and the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) have approved enzyme replacement for treatment of the visceral manifestations of MPS II.

Pompe's Disease

Acid maltase (acid a-glucosidase's GAA) deficiency, also called Pompe's disease, is the only glycogen lysosomal storage disease. The classic severe infantile form presents with hypotonia, myocardiopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. This variant is rapidly progressive and generally results in death in the first year of life. However, as with other lysosomal diseases, there are early- and late-onset forms of this disorder. The late-onset variants may be as common as 1/40,000. The late-onset patients typically present with a slowly progressive myopathy that may resemble a limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Respiratory insufficiency may be the presenting sign or it may develop with advancing disease. In late stages of the disease, patients may require mechanical ventilation, report swallowing difficulties, and experience loss of bowel and bladder control. Myocardiopathy is not usually seen in late-onset variants of Pompe's disease.

The FDA has approved enzyme infusion therapy for Pompe's disease. This is clearly life-prolonging for the infantile form, consistently resulting in improved cardiac function. Improved respiratory function is seen in most treated infants. Some infants demonstrated marked improvement in motor functions while others had minor changes in muscle tone or strength. Prevention of deterioration has been shown with GAA enzyme therapy in the late-onset forms. Early intervention with GAA enzyme therapy in such patients may limit or prevent the deterioration, but very advanced disease will have significant irreversible components.

Chapter 362. Glycogen Storage Diseases and Other Inherited Disorders of Carbohydrate Metabolism >
 

Glycogen Storage Diseases and Other Inherited Disorders of Carbohydrate Metabolism: Introduction

Carbohydrate metabolism plays a vital role in cellular function by providing the energy required for most metabolic processes. The relevant biochemical pathways involved in the metabolism of these carbohydrates are shown in Fig. 362-1. Glucose is the principle substrate of energy metabolism in humans. Metabolism of glucose generates ATP through glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The body obtains glucose through the ingestion of polysaccharides, primarily starch, and disaccharides including lactose, maltose, and sucrose. Galactose and fructose are two other monosaccharides that serve as sources of fuel for cellular metabolism; however, their role as fuel sources is much less significant than that of glucose. Galactose is derived from lactose (galactose + glucose), which is found in milk products, and is an important component for certain glycolipids, glycoproteins, and glycosaminoglycans. Fructose is found in fruits, vegetables, and honey. Sucrose (fructose + glucose) is another dietary source of fructose and is a commonly used sweetener.

Glycogen, the storage form of glucose in animal cells, is composed of glucose residues joined in straight chains by 1-4 linkages and branched at intervals of 4每10 residues by 1-6 linkages. Glycogen forms a treelike molecule and can have a molecular weight of many millions. Glycogen may aggregate to form structures recognizable by electron microscopy. With the exception of glycogen storage disease (GSD) type 0, defects in glycogen metabolism typically cause an accumulation of glycogen in the tissues, hence the name glycogen storage diseases. The stored glycogen could be normal or abnormal in structure in the various disorders. The defects in gluconeogenesis or glycolytic pathways, including galactose and fructose metabolism, do not usually result in glycogen accumulation.

Clinical manifestations of the various disorders of carbohydrate metabolism differ markedly. The symptoms range from harmless to lethal. Unlike disorders of lipid metabolism, mucopolysaccharidoses, or other storage diseases, dietary therapy has been effective in many of the carbohydrate disorders. All of the genes responsible for the inherited defects of carbohydrate metabolism have been cloned, and mutations have been identified. Advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of these diseases are being used to improve diagnosis and management. Some of these disorders are candidates for enzyme replacement, substrate reduction, and early trials of gene therapy.

Historically, the glycogen storage diseases were categorized numerically in the order in which the enzymatic defects were identified. They are also classified by the organs involved and clinical manifestations. This is the system followed in this chapter (Table 362-1). The overall frequency of all forms of glycogen storage disease is approximately 1 in 20,000 live births. Most are inherited as autosomal recessive traits; however, phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency and one form of phosphorylase kinase deficiency are X-linked disorders. The most common childhood disorders are glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency (type I), lysosomal acid -glucosidase deficiency (type II), debrancher deficiency (type III), and liver phosphorylase kinase deficiency (type IX). The most common adult disorder is myophosphorylase deficiency (type V, or McArdle disease).

Selected Liver Glycogenoses

Disorders with Hepatomegaly and Hypoglycemia

Type I Glycogen Storage Disease (Glucose-6-Phosphatase or Translocase Deficiency, Von Gierke's Disease)

Type I glycogen storage disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency in liver, kidney, and intestinal mucosa. There are two subtypes of GSD I: type Ia, in which the glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme is defective, and type Ib, in which the translocase that transports glucose-6-phosphate across the microsomal membrane is defective. The defects in both subtypes lead to inadequate conversion in the liver of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose and thus make affected individuals susceptible to fasting hypoglycemia.

Clinical and Laboratory Findings

Persons with type I disease may develop hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis during the neonatal period; however, more commonly, they exhibit hepatomegaly at 3每4 months of age. Hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis can develop after a short fast. These children usually have doll-like faces with fat cheeks, relatively thin extremities, short stature, and a protuberant abdomen that is due to massive hepatomegaly. The kidneys are enlarged, but the spleen and heart are of normal size. The hepatocytes are distended by glycogen and fat with large and prominent lipid vacuoles. Despite hepatomegaly, liver enzymes are usually normal or near normal. Easy bruising and epistaxis are associated with a prolonged bleeding time as a result of impaired platelet aggregation/adhesion. Hyperuricemia is present. Hyperlipidemia includes elevation of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Type Ib patients have additional findings of neutropenia and impaired neutrophil function, resulting in recurrent bacterial infections and oral and intestinal mucosal ulceration. GSD I patients may experience intermittent diarrhea, which can worsen with age. In GSD Ib, it is largely due to loss of mucosal barrier function caused by inflammation.

Long-Term Complications

Gout usually becomes symptomatic at puberty as a result of the long-term hyperuricemia. Puberty is often delayed. Nearly all females have ultrasound findings consistent with polycystic ovaries; however, the other clinical features of polycystic ovary syndrome, such as acne and hirsutism, are not seen. Several reports of successful pregnancy in women with GSD I suggest fertility is not affected. Increased bleeding during menstrual cycles, including life-threatening menorrhagia, has been reported. Secondary to the lipid abnormalities, there is an increased risk of pancreatitis. Patients with GSD I may be at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Frequent fractures and radiographic evidence of osteopenia/osteoporosis can be observed in adult patients, and radial bone mineral content is significantly reduced in prepubertal patients. Pulmonary hypertension, although rare, has been reported. By the second or third decade, most patients with type I glycogen storage disease develop hepatic adenomas that can hemorrhage and, in some cases, become malignant. Renal disease is a serious late complication. Almost all patients older than 20 years have proteinuria, and many have hypertension, kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis, and altered creatinine clearance. In some patients, renal function deteriorates and progresses to complete failure, requiring dialysis or transplantation.

Diagnosis

Clinical presentation and abnormal plasma lactate and lipid values suggest that a patient may have GSD I, but gene-based mutation analysis provides a noninvasive means of reaching a definitive diagnosis for most patients with types Ia and Ib disease. Before the glucose-6-phosphatase and glucose-6-phosphate translocase genes were cloned, a definitive diagnosis required a liver biopsy to demonstrate a deficiency.

Treatment: Type I Glycogen Storage Disease

Treatment involves the maintenance of normal blood glucose levels through continuous infusion of glucose via feeding tube or oral administration of uncooked cornstarch. Uncooked cornstarch serves as a slow-release form of glucose and can be given at a dose of 1.6 g/kg every 4 h for infants younger than 2 years. As the child grows older, the cornstarch regimen can be changed to every 6 h at a dose of 1.75每2.5 g/kg of body weight. Newer starch products may be longer acting, better tolerated, and more palatable. Since fructose and galactose cannot be converted to free glucose, their dietary intake should be restricted. Dietary supplements of multivitamins, calcium, and Vitamin D are often required. Allopurinol is given to lower uric acid levels, if levels remain elevated despite diet and metabolic control. The hyperlipidemia can be reduced with dietary control, use of medium chain triglycerides, fish oil and lipid-lowering drugs such as statins and fibric acids. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are beneficial for treating microalbuminuria, an early indicator of renal dysfunction in these patients. Citrate supplementation may be beneficial in preventing or ameliorating nephrocalcinosis and development of urinary calculi. Orthotropic liver transplantation is a treatment usually reserved for GSD I patients with liver malignancy, multiple liver adenomas, metabolic derangements refractory to medical management, and/or liver failure.

Type III Glycogen Storage Disease (Debrancher Deficiency, Limit Dextrinosis)

Type III GSD is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of glycogen debranching enzyme. Debranching and phosphorylase enzyme are responsible for complete degradation of glycogen. When the debranching enzyme is defective, glycogen breakdown is incomplete. Abnormal glycogen accumulates with short outer chains and resembles dextrin.

Clinical and Laboratory Findings

Deficiency of glycogen debranching enzyme causes hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, short stature, variable skeletal myopathy, and cardiomyopathy. The disorder usually involves both liver and muscle and is termed type IIIa glycogen storage disease. However, in about 15% of patients, the disease appears to involve only the liver and is classified as type IIIb. Hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and elevated liver transaminases occur in children. In contrast to type I disease, fasting ketosis can be prominent, transaminases are elevated, and blood lactate and uric acid concentrations are usually normal. Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels can sometimes be used to identify patients with muscle involvement, but normal levels do not rule out muscle enzyme deficiency. In most patients with type III disease, hepatomegaly improves with age; however, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma may occur in late adulthood. Hepatic adenomas may occur although less common than in GSOI. Left ventricular hypertrophy and life-threatening arrhythmias have been reported. Those with type IIIa may experience muscle weakness in childhood that can become severe after the third or fourth decade of life. Polycystic ovaries are common in GSD III, and some patients develop features of polycystic ovarian syndrome, such as hirsutism and irregular menstrual cycles. Reports of successful pregnancy in women with GSD III suggest fertility is normal.

Diagnosis

In type IIIa glycogen storage disease, deficient debranching enzyme activity can be demonstrated in liver, skeletal muscle, and heart. In contrast, patients with type IIIb have debranching enzyme deficiency in the liver but not in muscle. In the past, definitive assignment of subtype required enzyme assays in both liver and muscle. DNA-based analyses now provide a noninvasive way of subtyping these disorders in most patients. However, the large size of the gene and the distribution of private mutations across it pose challenges in DNA based analysis.

Treatment: Type III Glycogen Storage Disease

Dietary management of type III disease is less demanding than that of type I. Frequent high-carbohydrate meals with cornstarch supplements or nocturnal gastric drip feedings are usually effective in treating hypoglycemia. A high-protein diet is recommended as neoglucogenesis is intact in GSD III thus providing a source for glucose.

Type IX Glycogen Storage Disease (Liver Phosphorylase Kinase Deficiency)

Defects of phosphorylase kinase cause a heterogeneous group of glycogenoses. The phosphorylase kinase enzyme complex consists of four subunits (, , , and ). Each is encoded by different genes (X chromosome as well as autosomes) that are differentially expressed in various tissues. Phosphorylase kinase deficiency can be divided into several subtypes on the basis of the gene/subunit involved, the tissues primarily affected, and the mode of inheritance. The most common subtype is X-linked liver phosphorylase kinase deficiency, which is one of the most common liver glycogenoses. Phosphorylase kinase activity may also be deficient in erythrocytes and leukocytes but is normal in muscle. Typically, a child between the ages of 1 and 5 years presents with growth retardation and hepatomegaly. Levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and liver enzymes are mildly elevated. Fasting ketosis is another feature of the disease. Lactic and uric acid levels are usually normal. Hypoglycemia is typically mild, in the X-linked form of the disease. Phenotypic variability is being increasingly recognized in the x-linked form. The accumulated glycogen in liver ( particles, rosette form) has a frayed or burst appearance and is less compact than the glycogen seen in type I or type III GSD. Hepatomegaly and abnormal blood chemistries gradually return to normal with age. Most adults reach a normal final height and are practically asymptomatic, despite a persistent phosphorylase kinase deficiency. Prognosis is usually good, and adult patients have normal stature and minimal hepatomegaly. "With further study, long term issues will be better understood."

Treatment is symptomatic. A high-carbohydrate diet and frequent feedings are effective in preventing hypoglycemia. Some patients require no specific treatment.

Other subtypes of type IX include an autosomal recessive form of liver and muscle phosphorylase kinase deficiency, an autosomal recessive form of liver phosphorylase kinase deficiency that often develops into liver cirrhosis, a muscle-specific phosphorylase kinase deficiency that causes cramps and myoglobinuria with exercise, and a cardiac-specific phosphorylase kinase deficiency that is lethal during infancy because of massive glycogen deposition in the myocardium. The finding of PK deficiency maybe a secondary phenomena as a subset of these patients have been found to have mutations in PRKAG2.

Other Liver Glycogenoses with Hepatomegaly and Hypoglycemia

These disorders include glycogen synthase deficiency (type 0) and hepatic glycogenosis with renal Fanconi syndrome (type XI). The latter is caused by defects in the facilitative glucose transporter 2 (GLUT-2), which transports glucose in and out of hepatocytes, pancreatic cells, and the basolateral membranes of intestinal and renal epithelial cells. The disease is characterized by proximal renal tubular dysfunction, impaired glucose and galactose utilization, and accumulation of glycogen in liver and kidney.
 
Selected Muscle Glycogenoses

Disorders with Muscle-Energy Impairment

Type V Glycogen Storage Disease (Muscle Phosphorylase Deficiency, Mcardle Disease)

Type V glycogen storage disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of muscle phosphorylase. McArdle disease is a prototypical muscle energy disorder as the enzyme deficiency limits ATP generation by glycogenolysis and results in glycogen accumulation.

Clinical and Laboratory Findings

Symptoms usually first develop in adulthood and involve exercise intolerance with muscle cramps. Two types of activity tend to cause symptoms: (1) brief exercise of great intensity, such as sprinting or carrying heavy loads; and (2) less-intense but sustained activity, such as climbing stairs or walking uphill. Most patients can engage in moderate exercise, such as walking on level ground, for long periods. Although most patients experience episodic muscle pain and cramping as a result of exercise, 35% report permanent pain that seriously affects sleep and other activities. About half of patients report burgundy-colored urine after exercise, resulting from myoglobinuria secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Intense myoglobinuria after vigorous exercise can lead to renal failure. Clinical heterogeneity is uncommon, however there are cases with symptom onset as late as the eighth decade and cases that present early with hypotonia, generalized muscle weakness, and progressive respiratory insufficiency, which is often fatal.

In rare cases, electromyography (EMG) findings may suggest an inflammatory myopathy, a diagnosis that may be confused with polymyositis. These patients may be at risk for a statin-induced myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.

During rest, the serum CK level is usually elevated; after exercise, the CK level increases even more. Exercise also increases the levels of blood ammonia, inosine, hypoxanthine, and uric acid. The latter abnormalities are caused by accelerated recycling of muscle purine nucleotides in the face of insufficient ATP production.

Diagnosis

Lack of an increase in blood lactate and exaggerated blood ammonia elevations after an ischemic exercise test are indicative of a muscle glycogenosis and suggest a defect in the conversion of glycogen or glucose to lactate. The abnormal exercise response, however, can also occur with other defects in glycogenolysis or glycolysis, such as deficiencies of muscle phosphofructokinase or debranching enzyme (when the test is done after fasting). Definitive diagnosis is made by enzymatic assay in muscle tissue or by mutation analysis of the myophosphorylase gene.

Treatment: Type V Glycogen Storage Disease

In general, avoidance of strenuous exercise can prevent major episodes of rhabdomyolysis; however, regular and moderate exercise is recommended to improve exercise capacity. Sucrose administered before exercise can markedly improve tolerance in these patients. A high-protein diet may increase exercise endurance. Creatine and vitamin B6 supplementation have also been shown to improve muscle function in some patients. In general, longevity does not appear to be affected.

Disorders with Progressive Skeletal Muscle Myopathy and/or Cardiomyopathy

Pompe Disease, Type II Glycogen Storage Disease (Acid a-1,4 Glucosidase Deficiency)

Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of lysosomal acid -1,4 glucosidase (acid maltase), an enzyme responsible for the degradation of glycogen in the lysosomes. It is characterized by the accumulation of glycogen in the lysosomes as opposed to accumulation in cytoplasm as in the other glycogenoses.

Clinical and Laboratory Findings

The disorder encompasses a range of phenotypes. Each includes myopathy but differs in the age of onset, organ involvement, and clinical severity. The most severe is the infantile form with cardiomegaly, hypotonia, and death before age 1. Infants may appear normal at birth but soon develop generalized muscle weakness with feeding difficulties, macroglossia, hepatomegaly, and congestive heart failure due to a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

The late onset form (juvenile, or late-childhood, or adult form) is characterized by skeletal muscle manifestations, usually without or with minimal cardiac involvement, and a more slowly progressive course. The juvenile form typically presents as delayed motor milestones (if age of onset is early enough) and difficulty in walking. With disease progression, patients often develop swallowing difficulties, proximal muscle weakness, and respiratory muscle involvement. Death may occur before the end of the second decade.

The adult form presents as a slowly progressive myopathy without overt cardiac involvement and typically has its onset between the second and seventh decades. The clinical picture is dominated by slowly progressive proximal muscle weakness with truncal involvement. The pelvic girdle, paraspinal muscles, and diaphragm are most seriously affected. Respiratory symptoms include somnolence, morning headache, orthopnea, and exertional dyspnea. In rare instances patients present with respiratory insufficiency as the initial symptom.

Laboratory findings include elevated levels of serum CK, aspartate transaminase, and lactate dehydrogenase. In infants, chest x-ray shows massive cardiomegaly and electrocardiographic findings include a high-voltage QRS complex and a shortened PR interval. Muscle biopsy shows the presence of vacuoles that stain positively for glycogen; muscle acid phosphatase is increased, presumably from a compensatory increase of lysosomal enzymes. EMG reveals myopathic features with irritability of muscle fibers and pseudomyotonic discharges. Serum CK is not always elevated in adults, and depending on the muscle biopsied or tested, muscle histology or EMG may not be abnormal. The affected muscle should be examined.

Diagnosis

The confirmatory step for a diagnosis of Pompe disease is enzyme assay demonstrating deficient acid -glucosidase or gene sequence showing 2 pathogenic mutations in the GAA gene. Enzyme activity can be measured in muscle, cultured skin fibroblasts, or blood. Deficiency is usually more severe in the infantile form than in the juvenile and adult disorders.

Treatment: Type II Glycogen Storage Disease

Nocturnal ventilatory support in late-onset patients improves the quality of life and is beneficial during a period of respiratory decompensation. A definitive therapy is now available using aglucosidase alfa (Myozyme), a recombinant human acid -glucosidase at 20 mg/kg body weight every 2 weeks as an intravenous infusion. In the clinical trials, aglucosidase alfa has been shown to improve ventilator-free survival and motor function in patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease as compared to untreated controls. A randomized placebo-controlled trial in adults demonstrated stabilization of musculoskeletal outcomes and respiratory parameters.

Glycogen Storage Disease Mimicking Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

Deficiencies of lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2, also called Danon's disease) and protein kinase, adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated gamma 2 noncatalytic subunit (PRKAG2) result in the accumulation of glycogen in the heart and skeletal muscle. Clinically, these patients present primarily as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Their electrophysiologic abnormalities, particularly ventricular preexcitation and conduction defects, can distinguish them from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy resulting from defects in sarcomere-protein genes. In patients with LAMP2 deficiency, the onset of cardiac symptoms, including chest pain, palpitation, syncope, and cardiac arrest, can occur between the ages of 8 and 15 years, which is younger than the average age of 33 years for patients with PRKAG2 deficiency. The prognosis for LAMP2 deficiency is poor, with progressive end-stage heart failure early in adulthood. By contrast, long-term survival is possible for patients with cardiomyopathy due to PRKAG2 mutations, although some patients may require the implantation of a pacemaker and aggressive control of arrhythmias. There is a congenital form of PRKAG2 that presents in early infancy with severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and a rapidly fatal course. In these patients, levels of phosphorylase kinase have been found to be low.
 
Selected Disorders of Galactose Metabolism

"Classic" galactosemia is caused by galactose 1-phosphate uridyl transferase deficiency. It is a serious disease with an incidence of 1 in 60,000 and an early onset of symptoms. The newborn infant normally receives up to 20% of caloric intake as lactose, which consists of glucose and galactose. Without the transferase, the infant is unable to metabolize galactose 1-phosphate (Fig. 362-1), which accumulates, resulting in injury to parenchymal cells of the kidney, liver, and brain. Patients with galactosemia are at increased risk for Escherichia coli neonatal sepsis; the onset of sepsis often precedes the diagnosis of galactosemia.

Widespread newborn screening for galactosemia has identified these infants early and allowed them to be placed on dietary restriction. Elimination of galactose from the diet reverses growth failure and renal and hepatic dysfunction, improving the prognosis. However, on long-term follow-up, some patients still have ovarian failure manifest as primary or secondary amenorrhea, as well as developmental delays and learning disabilities, which increase in severity with age. Eighty to over ninety percent of women with classic galactosemia report hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. While most female patients are infertile when they reach childbearing age, a small number have given birth. There are several mutations that appear protective, particularly the S135L mutation, which is more common in the African American population. In addition, most patients have speech disorders, and a smaller number demonstrate poor growth and impaired motor function and balance (with or without overt ataxia). The treatment of galactosemia to prevent long-term complications remains a challenge.

Deficiency of galactokinase (Fig. 362-1) causes cataracts. Deficiency of uridine diphosphate galactose 4-epimerase can be benign when the enzyme deficiency is limited to blood cells but can be as severe as classic galactosemia when the enzyme deficiency is generalized.
 
Selected Disorders of Fructose Metabolism

Fructokinase deficiency (Fig. 362-1) causes a benign condition that is usually an incidental finding made through the detection of fructose as a reducing substance in the urine.

Deficiency of fructose 1-6 bisphosphate aldolase (aldolase B, hereditary fructose intolerance) is a serious disease in infants. These patients are healthy and asymptomatic until fructose or sucrose (table sugar) is ingested (usually from fruit, sweetened cereal, or sucrose-containing formula). Clinical manifestations may include jaundice, hepatomegaly, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, and convulsions. There is a higher incidence of celiac disease in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (>10%) than in the general population (1每3%). Laboratory findings show a prolonged clotting time, hypoalbuminemia, elevation of bilirubin and transaminases, and proximal renal tubular dysfunction. If the disease is not diagnosed and intake of the noxious sugar continues, hypoglycemic episodes recur, and liver and kidney failure progresses, eventually leading to death. Treatment requires the elimination of all sources of sucrose, fructose, and sorbitol from the diet. Through this treatment, liver and kidney dysfunction improve, and catch-up growth is common; intellectual development is usually unimpaired. Over time, the patient's symptoms become milder, even after fructose ingestion, and the long-term prognosis is good.

Fructose 1,6-diphosphatase deficiency is characterized by childhood life-threatening episodes of acidosis, hypoglycemia, hyperventilation, convulsions, and coma. These episodes are triggered by febrile infections and gastroenteritis when oral food intake decreases. Laboratory findings show low blood glucose, high lactate and uric acid levels, and metabolic acidosis. Unlike hereditary fructose intolerance, there is usually no aversion to sweets, and renal tubular and liver functions are normal. Treatment of acute attacks requires the correction of hypoglycemia and acidosis by intravenous infusion. Later, avoidance of fasting and elimination of fructose and sucrose from the diet prevent further episodes. A slowly released carbohydrate such as cornstarch is useful for the long-term prevention of hypoglycemia. Prognosis is good as patients who survive childhood develop normally.
 
Global Considerations

The glycogen storage diseases and other inherited disorders of carbohydrate metabolism although rare, have been reported in most ethnic populations. The prevalent genetic mutations for each disease may vary in different ethnic populations but clinical symptoms are remarkably similar and treatment guidelines apply to all populations.

Chapter 363. Heritable Disorders of Connective Tissue >
 

Heritable Disorders of Connective Tissue: Introduction

Some of the most common heritable disorders involve the major connective tissues of the body such as bone, skin, cartilage, blood vessels, and basement membranes. Identification of the causes of these disorders has underscored the important structural role of connective tissue proteins, such as the collagens, fibrillin, and elastin. However, these studies have also uncovered unanticipated defects in other proteins and enzymes involved in cell signaling and protein processing. The literature on connective tissue disorders is vast. Consequently, this chapter will focus on the classification and pathophysiology of these disorders and summarize the clinical features and management of the more common disorders.
 
Classification of Connective Tissue Disorders

The original classification of connective tissue diseases was based on the pattern of inheritance, the cluster of signs and symptoms, as well as radiologic and histologic features. Identification of the mutations causing the diseases has provided a rational framework for understanding the multiple manifestations of the diseases and has led to revisions in the classifications. Also, it has provided tests for prenatal diagnosis and important information for genetic counseling. The usefulness of these tests is likely to increase with the capability to analyze the complete genomes of patients. At the same time, the identification of mutations has thus far provided few new therapies. Also, as with many genetic diseases, the mutations are not always reliable predictors of clinical outcomes. For example, identical collagen I mutations in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) can be associated with clinical mild or lethal phenotypes for reasons that are not apparent. Also, the current classifications tend to overemphasize the etiologic differences between genetic diseases that are apparent in infants versus similar diseases that appear later in life. For example, small subsets of patients with initial diagnoses of postmenopausal osteoporosis, familial aortic aneurysms, or osteoarthritis have mutations in collagen genes similar to the mutations that are found in patients with OI or chondrodysplasia (CD).

Composition of Connective Tissues

Connective tissues contain a large number of complex macromolecules (Table 363-1). The most abundant components are three similar fibrillar collagens (types I, II, and III). They have about the same tensile strength as steel wires. The three fibrillar collagens are distributed in a tissue-specific manner: Type I collagen accounts for most of the protein of dermis, ligaments, tendons, and demineralized bone; type I and type III are the most abundant proteins of large blood vessels; and type II is the most abundant protein of cartilage.

aOver 30 proteoglycans have now been identified. They differ in the structures of their core proteins and their contents of glycosaminoglycan side chains of chondroitin-4-sulfate, chondroitin-6-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and keratin sulfate. Basal lamina contains a proteoglycan with a side chain of heparan sulfate that resembles heparin.
 

Biosynthesis and Turnover of Connective Tissues

Connective tissues are among the most stable components in living organisms, but they are not inert. During embryonic development, connective tissue membranes appear as early as the four-cell blastocyst to provide strength and a structural scaffold for the developing embryo. With the development of blood vessels and skeleton, there is a rapid increase in the synthesis, degradation, and resynthesis of connective tissues. The turnover continues at a slower but still rapid pace throughout postnatal development and then spikes during the growth spurt of puberty. During adulthood, the metabolic turnover of most connective tissues is slow, but it continues at a moderate pace in bone. With age, malnutrition, physical inactivity, and low gravitational stress, the rate of degradation of most connective tissues, especially bone and skin, begins to exceed the rate of synthesis and the tissues shrink. In starvation, a large fraction of the collagen in skin and other connective tissues is degraded and provides amino acids for gluconeogenesis (Chap. 75). In both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, there is extensive degradation of articular cartilage collagen. Glucocorticoids weaken most tissues by decreasing collagen synthesis. In many pathologic states, however, collagen is deposited in excess. With most injuries to tissues, inflammatory and immune responses stimulate the deposition of collagen fibrils in the form of fibrotic scars. The deposition of the fibrils is largely irreversible and prevents regeneration of normal tissues in hepatic cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, atherosclerosis, and nephrosclerosis.

Structure and Biosynthesis of Fibrillar Collagens

The tensile strength of collagen fibers derives primarily from the self-assembly of protein monomers into large fibril structures in a process that resembles crystallization. The self-assembly requires monomers of highly uniform and rigid structure. It also requires a complex series of posttranslational processing steps that maintain the solubility of the monomers until they are transported to the appropriate extracellular sites for fibril assembly. Because of the stringent requirements for correct self-assembly, it is not surprising that mutations in genes for fibrillar collagens cause many of the diseases of connective tissues.

The monomers of the three fibrillar collagens are formed from three polypeptide chains, called  chains, that are wrapped around each other into a ropelike triple-helical conformation. The triple helix is a unique structure among proteins, and it provides rigidity to the molecule. It also orients the side chains of amino acids in an "inside out" manner relative to most other proteins so that the charged and hydrophobic residues on the surface can direct self-assembly of the monomers into fibrils. The triple-helical conformation of the monomer is generated because each of the  chains has a repetitive amino acid sequence in which glycine (Gly) appears as every third amino acid. Each  chain contains about 1000 amino acids. Therefore, the sequence of each  chain can be designated as (-Gly-X-Y-)n, where X and Y represent amino acids other than glycine and n is >338. The presence of glycine, the smallest amino acid, in every third position in the sequence is critical because this residue must fit in a sterically restricted space in the middle of the helix where the three chains come together. The requirement for a glycine residue at every third position explains the severe effects of mutations that convert any of the glycine residues to an amino acid with a bulkier side chain (see below). Many of the X- and Y-position amino acids are proline and hydroxyproline, which, because of their ring structures, provide additional rigidity to the triple helix. Other X- and Y-positions are occupied by charged or hydrophobic amino acids that precisely direct lateral and longitudinal assembly of the monomers into highly ordered thin fibrils. Mutations that substitute amino acids in some X- and Y-positions can, in rare instances, also produce genetic diseases.

The fibers formed by the three fibrillar collagens differ in thickness and length, but they have a similar fine structure. As viewed by electron microscopy, they all have a characteristic pattern of cross-striations that are about one-quarter the length of the monomers and reflect the precise packing into fibrils. The three fibrillar collagens, however, differ in sequences found in the X- and Y-positions of the  chains and therefore in some of their physical properties. Type I collagen is composed of two identical 1(I) chains and a third 2(I) chain that differs slightly in its amino acid sequence. Type II collagen is composed of three identical (II) chains. Type III collagen is composed of three identical 1(III) chains.

To deliver a monomer of the correct structure to the appropriate site of fibril assembly, the biosynthesis of fibrillar collagens involves a large number of unique processing steps (Fig. 363-1). The monomer, first synthesized as a soluble precursor called procollagen, contains an additional globular domain at each end. As the pro chains of procollagen are synthesized on ribosomes, the free N-terminal ends move into the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Signal peptides at the N termini are cleaved, and additional posttranslational reactions begin. Proline residues in the Y-position of the repeating -Gly-X-Y- sequences are converted to hydroxyproline by the enzyme prolyl hydroxylase. The hydroxylation of prolyl residues is essential for the three  chains of the monomer to fold into a triple helix at body temperature. The enzyme requires ascorbic acid as one of its essential cofactors, an observation that explains why wounds fail to heal in scurvy (Chap. 74). In scurvy, some of the underhydroxylated and unfolded protein accumulates in the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and is slowly degraded. Lysine residues in the Y-position are also hydroxylated to hydroxylysine by a separate lysyl hydroxylase. Many of the hydroxylysine residues are glycosylated with galactose or with galactose and glucose. A large mannose-rich oligosaccharide is assembled on the C-terminal propeptide of each chain. The pro chains are assembled by interactions among these C-terminal propeptides that control the selection of the appropriate partner chains to form hetero- or homotrimers and provide the correct chain registration required for subsequent formation of the collagen triple helix. After the C-terminal propeptides assemble three pro chains, a nucleus of triple helix is formed near the C terminus, and the helical conformation is propagated toward the N terminus in a zipper-like manner that resembles crystallization. The folding into the triple helix is spontaneous in solution, but as discussed below, identification of rare mutations causing OI demonstrated that the folding in cellulo is assisted by ancillary proteins. The fully folded protein is then secreted. After secretion, procollagen is processed to collagen by cleavage of the N propeptides and C propeptides by two specific proteinases. The release of the propeptides decreases the solubility of the protein about 1000-fold. The entropic energy that is released drives the self-assembly of the collagen into fibrils. Self-assembled collagen fibers have considerable tensile strength, but their strength is increased further by cross-linking reactions that form covalent bonds between  chains in one molecule and  chains in adjacent molecules.

Although the assembly of collagen monomers into fibers is a spontaneous reaction, the process in tissues is modulated by the presence of less abundant collagens (type V with type I, and type XI with type II) and by other components such as a series of small leucine-rich proteins (SLRPs). Some of the less abundant components alter the rate of fibril assembly, whereas others change the morphology of the fibers or their interactions with cells and other molecules.

Collagen fibers are resistant to most proteases, but during degradation of connective tissues, they are cleaved by specific matrix metalloproteinases (collagenases) that cause partial unfolding of the triple helices into gelatin-like structures that are further degraded by less specific proteinases.

Other Collagens and Related Molecules

The unique properties of the triple helix are used to define a family of at least 29 collagens that contain repetitive -Gly-X-Y- sequences and form triple helices of varying length and complexity. The proteins are heterogeneous both in structure and function, and many are the sites of mutations causing genetic diseases. For example, the type IV collagen found in basement membranes is composed of three  chains synthesized from any of six different genes. Mutations in any of the six genes can cause Alport syndrome.

Fibrillin Aggregates and Elastin

In addition to tensile strength, many tissues such as the lung, large blood vessels, and ligaments require elasticity. The elasticity was originally ascribed to an amorphous rubber-like protein named elastin. Subsequent analyses, largely sparked by discoveries of mutations causing the Marfan syndrome (MFS), demonstrated that the elasticity resided in thin fibrils composed primarily of large glycoproteins named fibrillins. The fibrillins contain large numbers of epidermal growth factor每like domains interspersed with characteristic cysteine-rich domains that are also found in latent transforming growth factor ? (TGF-?) binding proteins. The fibrillins assemble into long beadlike strands that also contain numerous other components including small and variable amounts of elastin, bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), and microfibril-associated glycoproteins (MAGPs). The principles whereby the fibrils provide elasticity to tissue and their biosynthetic assembly are still under investigation.

Proteoglycans

The resiliency to compression of connective tissues such as cartilage or the aorta is largely explained by the presence of proteoglycans. Proteoglycans are composed of a core protein to which are attached a large series of negatively charged polymers of disaccharides (largely chondroitin sulfates). At least 30 proteoglycans have been identified. They vary in their binding to collagens and other components of matrix, but specific functions have not been assigned to most. The major proteoglycan of cartilage, called aggrecan, has a core 2000-amino-acid protein that is decorated with about 100 side chains of chondroitin sulfate and keratin sulfate. The core protein, in turn, binds to long chains of the polymeric disaccharide hyaluronan to form proteoglycan aggregates, one of the largest soluble macromolecular structures in nature. Because of its highly negative charge and extended structure, the proteoglycan aggregate binds large amounts of water and small ions to distend the three-dimensional arcade of collagen fibers found in the same tissues. They thereby make the cartilage resilient to pressure.
 
Specific Disorders

Osteogenesis Imperfecta (Oi)

The central feature of OI is a severe decrease in bone mass that makes bones brittle. The disorder is frequently associated with blue sclerae, dental abnormalities (dentinogenesis imperfecta), progressive hearing loss, and a positive family history.

Classification

An extensive classification for OI has recently been revised (Table 363-2). Type I is the mildest subtype and can produce either mild or no apparent deformities of the skeleton. Most patients have distinctly blue sclerae. Type II produces bone so brittle that it is lethal in utero or shortly after birth; it is subclassified into types II A, B, and C, depending on radiologic findings. Of the severe nonlethal forms, type III is severely deforming, and type IV is moderately deforming. The rarer types V to VIII of OI are moderately to severely deforming (Table 363-2).

Table 363-2 Expanded Classification of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (Oi)

 
 
Type Bone Fragility Blue Sclerae Abnormal Dentition Hearing Loss Inheritance 
I Mild Present Present in some Present in most AD 
II Extreme Present Present in some Unknown S, rarely AR 
III Severe Bluish at birth Present in some High incidence AD, rarely AR 
IV Variable Absent Absent in IVA, present in IVB High incidence AD 
V Moderate to severe Absent Absent   AD 
VI Moderate to severe Absent Absent   Unknown 
VII Moderate Absent Absent Absent AR 
 


Abbreviations: AD, autosomal dominant; AR, autosomal recessive; S, sporadic.
 

The initial classifications of patients by types of OI do not always predict the clinical course of the disease. Some patients appear normal at birth and become progressively worse; others have multiple fractures in infancy and childhood, improve after puberty, and fracture more frequently later in life. Women are particularly prone to fracture during pregnancy and after menopause. A few women from families with mild variants of OI do not develop fractures until after menopause, and their disease may be difficult to distinguish from postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Incidence

Type I OI has a frequency of about 1 in 30,000 births. Type II OI has a reported incidence of about 1 in 60,000, but the combined incidence of the three severe forms that are recognizable at birth (types II, III, and IV) may be much higher. Only a few patients with types V, VI, VII, and VIII have been reported.

Skeletal Effects

In type I OI, the fragility of bones may be severe enough to limit physical activity or be so mild that individuals are unaware of any disability. Radiographs of the skull in patients with mild disease may show a mottled appearance because of small islands of irregular ossification. In type II OI, ossification of many bones is frequently incomplete. Continuously beaded or broken ribs and crumpled long bones (accordina femora) may be present. For reasons that are not apparent, the long bones may be either thick or thin. In types III and IV, multiple fractures from minor physical stress can produce severe deformities. Kyphoscoliosis can impair respiration, cause cor pulmonale, and predispose to pulmonary infections. The appearance of "popcorn-like" deposits of mineral in x-rays of the ends of long bones is an ominous sign. Progressive neurologic symptoms may result from basilar compression and communicating hydrocephalus. Type V OI is recognized by the presence of dislocated radial heads and hyperplastic callus formation. Rhizomelia and coxa vara are observed in patients with type VII. Type VIII is characterized by severe growth deficiency, skeletal undermineralization, and bulbous metaphyses.

In all forms of OI, bone mineral density is decreased. However, the degree of osteopenia may be difficult to evaluate because recurrent fractures limit exercise and thereby diminish bone mass. Surprisingly, fractures appear to heal normally.

Ocular Features

The sclerae can be normal, slightly bluish, or bright blue. The color is probably caused by a thinness of the collagen layers of the sclerae that allows the choroid layers to be seen. Blue sclerae, however, are an inherited trait in some families who do not have increased bone fragility.

Dentinogenesis

The teeth may be normal, moderately discolored, or grossly abnormal. The enamel generally appears normal, but the teeth may have a characteristic amber, yellowish brown, or translucent bluish gray color because of a deficiency of dentin that is rich in type I collagen. The deciduous teeth are usually smaller than normal, whereas permanent teeth are frequently bell-shaped and restricted at the base. In some patients, the teeth readily fracture and need to be extracted. Similar tooth defects, however, can be inherited without any evidence of OI.

Hearing Loss

Hearing loss usually begins during the second decade of life and occurs in more than 50% of individuals over age 30. The loss can be conductive, sensorineural, or mixed, and it varies in severity. The middle ear usually exhibits maldevelopment, deficient ossification, persistence of cartilage in areas that are normally ossified, and abnormal calcium deposits.

Other Features

Changes in other connective tissues can include thin skin that scars extensively, joint laxity with permanent dislocations indistinguishable from those of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), and occasionally, cardiovascular manifestations such as aortic regurgitation, floppy mitral valves, mitral incompetence, and fragility of large blood vessels. For unknown reasons, some patients develop bouts of a hypermetabolic state with elevated serum thyroxine levels, hyperthermia, and excessive sweating.

Molecular Defects

Most patients who meet the clinical criteria for OI are heterozygous for mutations in either the pro1 chain gene or the pro2 chain gene of type I procollagen (the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes). Over 90% of patients with type I OI and blue sclerae have mutations that reduce the synthesis of pro 1chains to about one half. Mutations that reduce the synthesis of pro2 chains produce slightly more severe phenotypes and skin defects similar to EDS.

In contrast to the null mutations found in type I OI, most of the severe variants (types II, III, and IV) are caused by mutations that produce structurally abnormal pro chains that have compromised assembly or abnormal folding of the triple helix. As with collagen mutations in other connective tissue diseases, these structural mutations generally fall into two functional categories. Firstly, the relatively rare mutations in the C-propeptide domain can prevent or seriously impair initial assembly of the procollagen trimers. These misfolded chains are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and targeted for degradation by the ER-associated proteasomal pathway. Because these mutations induce an ER-stress response, the unfolded protein response (UPR) may have many downstream effects on cells. ER stress is a new concept in the pathophysiology of connective tissue disease and has been best characterized for chondrodysplasias (see below).

The most common type I collagen mutations, however, are single base substitutions that introduce an amino acid with a bulky side chain for one of the glycine residues that appear as every third amino acid in the triple helix. In effect, any of the 338 glycine residues in either the pro1 or pro2 chain of type I procollagen is a potential site for a disease-producing mutation. These mutations compromise the structural integrity of the triple helix, causing disruption to helix folding, retention of the mutant trimers in the ER, and increased posttranslational hydroxylation and glycosylation of lysines. Collagen-containing helix mutations can form insoluble aggregates in the ER that are degraded by the autophagosome-endosome system, rather than the proteasomes.

A similar sequence of events occurs with less common mutations that produce partial gene deletions, partial gene duplications, and splicing mutations. The search for mutations causing the very rare recessive types of OI (VII and VIII) identified mutations in genes for a series of chaperone proteins that are essential for the timely folding of the procollagen monomer: cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP), prolyl-3-hydroxylase (LEPRE1/P3H1), cyclophilin B (PPIB), collagen chaperone-like protein HSP47 (SERPINH1), and the procollagen chaperone protein FKBP65 (FKBP10).

In addition to their intracellular effects, the structurally abnormal mutant-containing collagen that is secreted by the cell can also have important extracellular affects. For example, the presence of one abnormal pro chain in a procollagen molecule can interfere with cleavage of the N propeptide from the protein. The persistence of the N propeptide on a fraction of the molecules interferes with the self-assembly of normal collagen so that thin and irregular collagen fibrils are formed. Furthermore, if structurally abnormal collagens are incorporated into fibrils, they may have a destabilizing effect and be selectively degraded, or they may alter the interactions of collagen with other connective tissue components, disturbing architecture and stability.

Several generalizations can be made about mutations in type I collagengenes. One is that unrelated patients rarely have the same mutation in the same gene. Over 900 such "private" mutations have been identified. Glycine substitutions in the N-terminal region of the triple helix tend to produce milder phenotypes, apparently because they have less effect on the zipper-like propagation of the triple-helical conformation from the C terminus. Rare substitutions of charged amino acids (Asp, Arg) or a branched amino acid (Val) in X- or Y-positions produce lethal phenotypes, apparently because they are located at sites for lateral assembly of the monomers or binding of other components of matrix.

Inheritance and Mosaicism in Germ-Line Cells and in Somatic Cells

Type I OI is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. However, some patients with type I OI appear to represent sporadic new mutations or a diagnosis that was missed in earlier generations. Most lethal OI is the result of sporadic mutations that occur in the germ line in one of the parents. Because of the possibility for germ-line mosaicism for newly generated mutations, there is about a 7% probability that a second child could inherit a severe variant of OI.

Diagnosis

OI is usually diagnosed on the basis of clinical criteria. The presence of fractures together with blue sclerae, dentinogenesis imperfecta, or family history of the disease is usually sufficient to make the diagnosis. Other causes of pathologic fractures must be excluded, including battered child syndrome, nutritional deficiencies, malignancies, and other inherited disorders such as CDs and hypophosphatasia, that can have overlapping presentations. The absence of superficial bruises can be helpful in distinguishing OI from battered child syndrome. X-rays usually reveal a decrease in bone density that can be verified by photon or x-ray absorptiometry. Bone microscopy can be helpful in the diagnosis. A molecular defect in type I procollagen can be demonstrated in over two-thirds of patients by incubating skin fibroblasts with radioactive amino acids and then analyzing the pro chains by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mutations themselves can be defined in most patients by the sequencing of genomic DNA with tests that are currently available from specialized laboratories.

Treatment: Osteogenesis Imperfecta

Many patients with OI lead productive and successful lives despite severe deformities. Those with mild disorder may need little treatment when fractures decrease after puberty, but women require special attention during pregnancy and after menopause, when fractures again increase. More severely affected children require a comprehensive program of physical therapy and surgical management of fractures and skeletal deformities.

Many fractures are only slightly displaced and have little soft tissue swelling. Therefore, they can be treated with minimal support or traction for a week or two followed by a light cast. If fractures are relatively painless, physical therapy can be initiated early. A judicious amount of exercise prevents loss of bone mass secondary to physical inactivity. Some physicians advocate insertion of steel rods into long bones to correct limb deformities; the risk/benefits and cost/benefits of such procedures are difficult to evaluate. Aggressive conventional intervention is usually warranted for pneumonia and cor pulmonale. For severe hearing loss, stapedectomy or replacement of the stapes with a prosthesis may be successful. Moderately to severely affected patients should be evaluated periodically to anticipate possible neurologic problems. About half of children have a substantial increase in growth when given growth hormone. Treatment with bisphosphonates to decrease bone loss has been introduced for moderate to severe forms of OI. Initial responses were promising, particularly in decreasing bone pain. However the long-term effects of the drugs are still unknown. Also, a clinical trial was performed in which patients were treated by intravenous infusion of cells from bone marrow referred to as mesenchymal stem cells, or multipotential stromal cells (MSCs; see Chap. 67). Promising results were obtained, but the trial required a prior bone marrow transplant with marrow from a normal donor who subsequently was used as a source of normal MSCs. As a result, the procedure has not been widely adopted. However, the results raise the possibility that it may be possible in the future to develop effective stem cell therapies for OI.

Counseling and emotional support are important for patients and their parents; lay organizations in some countries provide help in these areas. Prenatal ultrasonography will detect severely affected fetuses at about 16 weeks of pregnancy. Diagnosis by demonstrating synthesis of abnormal pro chains or by DNA sequencing can be carried out in chorionic villus biopsies at 8每12 weeks of pregnancy.

Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome

EDS is characterized by hyperelasticity of the skin and hypermobile joints.

Classification

Several types of EDS have been defined, based on the extent to which the skin, joints, and other tissues are involved, mode of inheritance, and by molecular and biochemical analysis (Table 363-3). Classical EDS includes a severe form of the disease (type I) and a milder form (type II), both characterized by joint hypermobility and skin that is velvety in texture, hyperextensible, and easily scarred. In hypermobile EDS (type III), joint hypermobility is more prominent than skin changes. In vascular-type EDS (type IV), the skin changes are more prominent than joint changes, and the patients are predisposed to sudden death from rupture of large blood vessels or other hollow organs. EDS V is similar to EDS II but is inherited as an X-linked trait. The ocular-scoliotic type of EDS (type VI) is characterized by scoliosis, ocular fragility, and a cone-shaped deformity of the cornea (keratoconus). The arthrochalasic type of EDS (type VII A and B) is characterized by marked joint hypermobility that is difficult to distinguish from EDS III except by the specific molecular defects in the processing of type I procollagen to collagen. The periodontotic-type EDS (type VIII) is distinguished by prominent periodontal changes. EDS IX, X, and XI were defined on the basis of preliminary biochemical and clinical data. EDS due to tenascin X deficiency has not been assigned a type; it is an autosomal recessive form of the syndrome similar to EDS II. The cardiac valvular form of EDS has similar features to EDS II but also involves severe changes to the aorta. The progeroid form of EDS displays features of both EDS and progeria. Because of overlapping signs and symptoms, many patients and families with some of the features of EDS cannot be assigned to any of the defined types.

Abbreviations: AD, autosomal dominant; AR, autosomal recessive.
 

Incidence

The overall incidence of EDS is about 1 in 5000 births, with a higher rate for blacks. Classical and hypermobile types of EDS are the most common. Patients with milder forms frequently do not seek medical attention.

Skin

Skin changes vary from thin and velvety to skin that is either dramatically hyperextensible ("rubber person" syndrome) or easily torn or scarred. Patients with classical EDS develop characteristic "cigarette-paper" scars. In vascular-type EDS, extensive scars and hyperpigmentation develop over bony prominences, and the skin may be so thin that subcutaneous blood vessels are visible. In the periodontotic type of EDS, the skin is more fragile than hyperextensible, and it heals with atrophic, pigmented scars. Easy bruisability occurs in several types of EDS.

Ligament and Joint Changes

Laxity and hypermobility of joints vary from mild to unreducible dislocations of hips and other large joints. In mild forms, patients learn to avoid dislocations by limiting physical activity. In more severe forms, surgical repair may be required. Some patients have progressive difficulty with age.

Other Features

Mitral valve prolapse and hernias occur, particularly with type I. Pes planus and mild to moderate scoliosis are common. Extreme joint laxity and repeated dislocations may lead to degenerative arthritis. In the ocular-scoliotic type of EDS, the eye may rupture with minimal trauma, and kyphoscoliosis can cause respiratory impairment. Also, sclerae may be blue.

Molecular Defects

Subsets of patients with different types of EDS have mutations in the structural genes for collagens (Table 363-3). These include mutations in the COL1A1 gene in a few patients with moderately severe classical EDS (type I); mutations in COL1A2 in rare patients with an aortic valvular form of EDS; mutations in two of the three genes (COL5A1 and COL5A2) for type V collagen, a minor collagen found in association with type I collagen, in about half the patients with classical EDS (types I and II); mutations in the COL3A1 gene for type III collagen that is abundant in the aorta in patients with the frequently lethal vascular EDS (type IV).

Some of the type I collagen-related mutations alter processing of the protein or genes for the processing enzymes. Arthrochalasic EDS (type VII) is caused by mutations in amino acid sequence that make type I procollagen resistant to cleavage by procollagen N-proteinase or by mutations that decrease the activity of the enzyme. The persistence of the N propeptide causes the formation of collagen fibrils that are thin and irregular. Some of the patients have fragile bones and therefore a phenotype that overlaps with OI. The ocular-scoliotic type of EDS (type VI) is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the PLOD 1 gene, which encodes procollagen-lysine 5-dioxygenase (lysyl hydroxylase 1), an enzyme required for formation of stable cross-links in collagen fibers.

Some patients with the hypermobile EDS (type III) and a few with mild EDS (type II) have mutations in the TNXB gene, which encodes tenascin X, another minor component of connective tissue that appears to regulate the assembly of collagen fibers. Mutations in proteoglycans have been found in a few patients. The progeroid form of EDS results from autosomal recessive mutations in B4GALT7, the gene for -1,4-galactosyltransferase 7, a key enzyme in the addition of glycosaminoglycan chains to proteoglycans.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis is based on clinical criteria. Biochemical assays and gene analyses for known molecular defects in EDS are difficult and time-consuming, but tests are sometimes available from specialized laboratories. Correlations between genotype and phenotype are challenging, but the tests are particularly useful for the diagnosis of vascular-type IV EDS with its dire prognosis.

As with other heritable diseases of connective tissue, there is a large degree of variability among members of the same family carrying the same mutation. Some patients have increased fractures and are difficult to distinguish from OI. A few families with heritable aortic aneurysms have mutations in the gene for type III collagen without any evidence of EDS or OI.

Treatment: Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome

Surgical repair and tightening of joint ligaments require careful evaluation of individual patients, as the ligaments frequently do not hold sutures. Patients with easy bruisability should be evaluated for bleeding disorders. Patients with type IV EDS and members of their families should be evaluated at regular intervals for early detection of aneurysms, but surgical repair may be difficult because of friable tissues. Also, women with type IV EDS should be counseled about the increased risk of uterine rupture, bleeding, and other complications of pregnancy.

Chondrodysplasias

(See also Chap. 355) Chondrodysplasias (CDs), also referred to as skeletal dysplasias, are heritable skeletal disorders that are characterized by dwarfism and abnormal body proportions. The category also includes some individuals with normal stature and body proportions who have features such as ocular changes or cleft palate, which are common in more severe CDs. Many patients develop degenerative joint changes, and mild CD in adults may be difficult to differentiate from primary generalized osteoarthritis.

Classification

Over 200 distinct types and subtypes have been defined based on criteria such as "bringing death" (thanatophoric), causing "twisted" bones (diastrophic), affecting metaphyses (metaphyseal), affecting epiphyses (epiphyseal), affecting spine (spondylo-), and producing histologic changes such as an apparent increase in the fibrous material in the epiphyses (fibrochondrogenesis). Also, a number of eponyms are based on the first or most comprehensive case reports. Severe forms of the diseases produce dwarfism with gross distortions of most cartilaginous structures and of other structures including the eye. Mild forms are more difficult to classify. Among the features are cataracts, degeneration of the vitreous, and retinal detachment high forehead hypoplastic facies cleft palate short extremities and gross distortions of the epiphyses, metaphyses, and joint surfaces. Patients with Stickler syndrome (hereditary arthro-ophthalmopathy) have been classified into three types based on a combination of the ocular phenotype and mutated genes.

Incidence

The overall incidence of all forms of CD ranges from 1 per 2500 to 1 per 4000 births. Data on the frequency of individual CDs are incomplete, but the incidence of the Stickler syndrome is 1 in 10,000. Therefore, the disease is probably among the more common heritable disorders of connective tissue.

Molecular Defects

Mutations in the COL2A1 gene for the type II collagen of cartilage are found in a fraction of patients with both mild and severe CDs. For example, a mutation in the gene substituting a cysteine residue for an arginine was found in three unrelated families with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SED) and precocious generalized osteoarthritis (OA). Mutations in the gene were also found in some lethal CDs characterized by gross deformities of bones and cartilage, such as those found in spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia congenita, hypochondrogenesis/achondrogenesis type II, and Kniest syndrome. The highest incidence of COL2A1 mutations, however, occurs in patients with the distinctive features of the Stickler syndrome, which is characterized by skeletal changes, orofacial abnormalities, and auditory abnormalities. Most of the mutations in COL2A1 are premature stop codons that produce haploinsufficiency. In addition, some of the patients with the Stickler syndrome or a closely related syndrome have mutations in two genes specific for type XI collagen, which is an unusual heterotrimer formed from  chains encoded by the gene for type II collagen (COL2A1) and two distinctive genes for type XI collagen (COL11A1 and COL11A2). Mutations in the COL11A1 gene are also found in patients with Marshall syndrome, which is similar to classic Stickler syndrome but with more severe hearing loss and dysmorphic features, such as a flat or retracted midface with flat nasal bridge, short nose, anteverted nostrils, long philtrum, and large-appearing eyes.

CDs are also caused by mutations in the less abundant collagens found in cartilage. For example, patients with Schmid metaphyseal CD have mutations in the gene for type X collagen, a short, network-forming collagen found in the hypertrophic zone of endochondral cartilage. The syndrome is characterized by short stature, coxa vara, flaring metaphyses, and waddling gait. As with other collagen genes, the most common mutations are of two types: Nonsense mutations that lead to haploinsufficiency and structural mutations that compromise collagen assembly. In type X collagen all the structural mutations detected occur in the C-terminal NC1 domain that coordinates the formation of the trimers. This NC1 domain is functionally equivalent to the C propeptide of the fibrillar collagens. These mutations disturb the structure of the NC1 domain, leading to misfolding and initiation of cellular ER stress via the unfolded protein response (UPR). While the UPR evolved to allow cells to adjust their ER folding capacity to differing protein folding loads, it is deployed by cells when mutant misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER. Activation of the UPR attenuates protein translation and activates mutant protein degradation pathways such as ER-associated degradation. If these strategies do not sufficiently reduce the stress response, cell death may occur. In Schmid metaphyseal CD, mutant misfolded type X collagen induces the UPR, resulting in downstream consequences that contribute to the pathophysiology.

Some patients have mutations in genes for proteins that interact with collagens. Patients with pseudoachondroplasia, or autosomal dominant multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, have mutations in the gene for the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), a protein that interacts with both collagens and proteoglycans in cartilage. However, some families with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia have a defect in one of the three genes for type IX collagen (COL9A1, COL9A2, and COL9A3) or in matrilin-3, another extracellular protein found in cartilage. With misfolding mutations in COMP and matrilin-3, the activation of the UPR has been described, providing further evidence that the UPR is a component of pathology of these conditions.

Some CDs are caused by mutations in genes that affect early development of cartilage and related structures. The most common form of short-limbed dwarfism, achondroplasia, is caused by mutations in the gene for a receptor for a fibroblastic growth factor (FGFR3). The mutations in the FGFR3 gene causing achondroplasias are unusual in several respects. The same single-base mutation in the gene that converts glycine to arginine at position 380 in the FGFR3 gene is present in over 90% of patients. Most patients harbor sporadic new mutations, and therefore this nucleotide change must be one of the most common recurring mutations in the human genome. The mutation causes unregulated signal transduction through the receptor and inappropriate development of cartilage. Mutations that alter other domains of FGFR3 have been found in patients with the more severe disorders of hypochondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia and in a few families with a variant of craniosynostosis. However, most patients with craniosynostosis appear to have mutations in the related FGFR2 gene. The similarities between the phenotypes produced by mutations in genes for FGF receptors and mutations in structural proteins of cartilage are probably explained by the observation that the activity of FGFs is regulated in part by binding of FGFs to proteins sequestered in the extracellular matrix. Therefore, the situation parallels the interactions between transforming growth factors (TGFs) and fibrillin in MFS (see below).

Rare mutations involve the proteoglycans of cartilage. Patients with an autosomal recessive form of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia have mutations in a gene encoding a sulfate transporter protein (DTDST) required for synthesis of chondroitin sulfates and proteoglycans.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of CDs is made on the basis of the physical appearance, slit-lamp eye examinations, x-ray findings, histologic changes, and clinical course. Evaluation of patients by specialists in the field is usually required for a diagnosis. DNA tests for mutations in some of the genes are available from specialized laboratories. For Stickler syndrome, more precise diagnostic criteria have made it possible to identify type I variants with mutations in the COL2A1 gene with a high degree of accuracy. It has been suggested that the type II variant with mutations in the COL11A1 gene can be identified on the basis of a "beaded" vitreous phenotype, and the type III variant with mutations in the COL11A2 gene can be identified on the basis of the characteristic systemic features without the ocular involvement. Prenatal diagnosis based on analysis of DNA obtained from chorionic villus or amniotic fluid is possible.

Treatment: Chondrodysplasias

The treatment is symptomatic and is directed to secondary features such as degenerative arthritis. Many patients require joint replacement surgery and corrective surgery for cleft palate. The eyes should be monitored carefully for the development of cataracts and the need for laser therapy to prevent retinal detachment. Patients should be advised to avoid obesity and contact sports. Counseling for the psychological problems of short stature is critical, and support groups have formed in many countries.

Marfan Syndrome (Mfs)

MFS includes features that primarily affect the skeleton, the cardiovascular system, and the eyes.

Classification

MFS was initially characterized by a triad of features: (1) skeletal changes that include long, thin extremities, frequently associated with loose joints; (2) reduced vision as the result of dislocations of the lenses (ectopia lentis); and (3) aortic aneurysms. An international panel has developed a series of "Ghent criteria" that are useful in classifying patients.

Incidence and Inheritance

The incidence of MFS is among the highest of any heritable disorder: about 1 in 3000/5000 births in most racial and ethnic groups. The related syndromes are less common. Mutations are generally inherited as autosomal dominant traits, but about one-fourth of patients have sporadic new mutations.

Skeletal Effects

Patients have long limbs and are usually tall compared to other members of the same family. The ratio of the upper segment (top of the head to the top of the pubic ramus) to the lower segment (top of the pubic ramus to the floor) is usually 2 SDs below mean for age, race, and sex. The fingers and hands are long and slender and have a spider-like appearance (arachnodactyly). Many patients have severe chest deformities, including depression (pectus excavatum), protrusion (pectus carinatum), or asymmetry. Scoliosis is frequent and usually accompanied by kyphosis. CT or MRI examinations of the lumbar sacral region frequently reveals enlargement of the neural canal, thinning of the pedicles and laminae, widening of the foramins, or anterior meningocele (dural ectasia). High-arched palate and high pedal arches or pes planus are common. A few patients have severe joint hypermobility similar to EDS.

Cardiovascular Features

Cardiovascular abnormalities are the major source of morbidity and mortality (Chap. 248). Mitral valve prolapse develops early in life and progresses to mitral valve regurgitation of increasing severity in about one-quarter of patients. Dilation of the root of the aorta and the sinuses of Valsalva are characteristic and ominous features of the disease that can develop at any age. The rate of dilation is unpredictable, but it can lead to aortic regurgitation, dissection of the aorta, and rupture. Dilation is probably accelerated by physical and emotional stress, as well as by pregnancy. Patients with familial aortic aneurysms tend to develop aneurysms at the base of the abdominal aorta. The location of the aneurysms, however, is somewhat variable, and the high incidence of aortic aneurysms in the general population (1 in 100) makes the differential diagnosis difficult unless other features of MFS are clearly present.

Ocular Features

Upward displacement of the lens is common. It is usually not progressive but may contribute to the formation of cataracts. The ocular globe is frequently elongated, and most patients are myopic but with adequate vision. Retinal detachment can occur.

Other Features

Striae may occur over the shoulders and buttocks. A number of patients develop spontaneous pneumothorax. Inguinal and incisional hernias are common. Patients are typically thin with little subcutaneous fat, but adults may develop centripetal obesity.

Molecular Defects

More than 90% of patients clinically classified as having MFS by the "Ghent criteria" have a mutation in the gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1). Mutations in the same gene are found in a few patients who do not meet the Ghent criteria. Also, a few MFS patients without mutations in the FBN1 gene have mutations in the gene for TGF- receptor 2 (TGFBR2). In addition, mutations in either TGFBR2 or TGFBR1 are found in the related Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), which is characterized by aortic aneurysms, cleft palate, and hypertelorism. Mutations in the FBN2 gene, which is structurally similar to the FBN1 gene, which, are found in patients with MFS-like syndrome of congenital contractual arachnodactyly (CCA).

Over 550 different mutations have been found in the FBN1 gene, scattered throughout its 65 coding exons. Most are private mutations, but about 10% are recurrent new mutations that are largely located in CpG sequences known to be "hot spots." Most severe mutations are located in the central codons (24每32). About one-third of the mutations introduce premature termination codons, and about two-thirds are missense mutations that alter calcium-binding domains in the repetitive epidermal growth factor每like domains of the protein. Rarer mutations alter the processing of the protein. As in many genetic diseases, the severity of the phenotype cannot be predicted from the nature of the mutation.

The discovery that syndromes similar to MFS are caused by mutations in TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 refocused attention on structural similarity between fibrillin-1 and TGF- binding proteins that sequester TGF- in the extracellular matrix. As a result, some of the manifestations of MFS have been shown to arise from alterations in binding sites that modulate the activity of TGF- during early development of the skeleton and other tissues.

Diagnosis

All patients with a suspected diagnosis of MFS should have a slit-lamp examination and an echocardiogram. Also, homocystinuria should be ruled out by amino acid analysis of plasma (Chap. 364). The diagnosis of MFS according to the international Ghent standards places emphasis on major criteria that include presence of at least four skeletal abnormalities: ectopia lentis; dilation of the ascending aorta with or without dissection; dural ectasia; and a blood relative who meets the same criteria, with or without a DNA diagnosis. A final diagnosis is based on a balanced assessment of the major criteria together with several minor criteria. The absence of ocular changes suggests LDS, and the presence of contractures with some of the signs of OI suggests CCA.

Diagnostic tests based on detection of protein defects in fibrillin-1 in cultured skin fibroblasts or DNA analyses of most of the gene are now available from several laboratories. The results are unlikely to alter the treatment or prognosis, but are helpful to inform the patients and families and to rapidly exclude the diagnosis in unaffected family members.

Treatment: Marfan Syndrome

Propranolol or other -adrenergic blocking agents are used to lower blood pressure and thereby delay or prevent aortic dilation. Surgical correction of the aorta, aortic valve, and mitral valve has been successful in many patients, but tissues are frequently friable. Patients should be advised of the risks of severe physical and emotional stress and of pregnancy.

The scoliosis tends to be progressive and should be treated by mechanical bracing and physical therapy if >20∼ or by surgery if it progresses to >45∼. Dislocated lenses rarely require surgical removal, but patients should be followed closely for retinal detachment. The finding that MFS pathophysiology involves alterations in TGF- signaling has raised the possibility of new therapeutic strategies. Attenuation of TGF- signaling with agents such as angiotensin II receptor blockers (e.g., Losartan) appears promising based on studies in animal models and is undergoing clinical trials.

Elastin-Related Diseases

Mutations in the elastin gene (ELN) have been found in patients with supravalvular aortic stenosis and cutis laxa.

Epidermolysis Bullosa (Eb)

EB is of a group of similar disorders in which the skin and related epithelial tissues break and blister as the result of minor trauma.

Classification and Incidence

Four types of EB are defined on the basis of the level at which blistering occurs: (1) EB simplex for blistering in the epidermis, (2) EB hemidesmosomal for fissures between keratinocytes and the basal lamina, (3) EB junctional for blistering in the dermal-epidermal junction, and (4) EB dystrophica for blistering in the dermis.

The incidence of EB in the United States is about 1 in 50,000.

Molecular Defects

The distinctive anatomic features of skin have made it possible to relate the clinical features of subtypes of EB to mutations for specific components. Mutations in the genes for the major keratins of basal epithelial cells (keratins 14 and 15) are found in patients with the blistering skin of EB simplex. Patients with the related syndrome, epidermolytic ichthyosis, have mutations in keratin 1 and keratin 10. Mutations in a large number of genes for the complex structure of hemidesmosomes are found in EB hemidesmosomal. Hemidesmosomal mutations occur in genes for type XVII collagen, lamin 3, 6 integrin, 4 integrin, and plectin. Mutations in the genes for components of the dermal-epidermal junction are found in EB junctional and include: three lamin genes (A3, B3, and C2) and type XVII collagen. Mutations in the gene that codes for type VII collagen that forms long anchoring fibrils for the basement membrane are found in the severe syndrome of EB dystrophica.

Diagnosis and Treatment

The diagnosis is based on skin that readily breaks and forms blisters. EB simplex and EB hemidesmosomal are generally milder than EB junctional or EB dystrophica. EB dystrophica variants usually cause large and prominent scars. Precise classification within subtypes usually requires electron microscopy. DNA diagnostic tests are also available. The treatment is symptomatic.

Alport Syndrome (as)

AS is an inherited disorder characterized by hematuria and several associated features. Four forms of the disease are now recognized: (1) classic AS, which is inherited as an X-linked disorder with hematuria, sensorineural deafness, and conical deformation of the anterior surface of the lens (lenticonus); (2) a subtype of the X-linked form associated with diffuse leiomyomatosis; (3) an autosomal recessive form; and (4) an autosomal dominant form. Both autosomal recessive and dominant forms can cause renal disease without deafness or lenticonus.

Incidence

The incidence of AS is about 1 in 10,000 births in the general population and as high as 1 in 5000 in some ethnic groups. About 80% of AS patients have the classical X-linked variant.

Molecular Defects

Most patients have mutations in four of the six genes for the chains of type IV collagen (COL4A3, COL4A4, COL4A5, and COL4A6). The genes for the proteins are arranged in tandem pairs on different chromosomes in an unusual head-to-head orientation and with overlapping promoters; i.e., the COL4A1 and COL4A2 genes are head-to-head on chromosome 13q34, the COL4A3 and COL4A4 genes are on chromosome 2q35每37, and the COL4A5 and COL4A6 genes are on chromosome Xq22. The X-linked variants are caused by either mutations in the COL4A5 gene or by partial deletions of both of the adjacent COL4A4 and COL4A5 genes. The autosomal recessive variants are caused by mutations in either the COL4A3 or COL4A4 genes. The mutations responsible for the autosomal dominant variants are still unknown, but they have been mapped to the same locus as the COL4A3 and COL4A4 genes.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of classic AS is based on X-linked inheritance of hematuria, sensorineural deafness, and lenticonus. The lenticonus together with hematuria is pathognomonic of classic AS. The sensorineural deafness is primarily in the high-tone range. It can frequently be detected only by an audiogram and is usually not progressive. Because of the X-linked transmission, women are generally underdiagnosed and are usually less severely affected than men. The hematuria usually progresses to nephritis and may cause renal failure in late adolescence in affected males and at older ages in some women. Renal transplantation is usually successful.

 Chapter 364. Inherited Disorders of Amino Acid Metabolism in Adults >
 

Inherited Disorders of Amino Acid Metabolism in Adults: Introduction

Amino acids are not only the building blocks of proteins but also serve as neurotransmitters (glycine, glutamate, -aminobutyric acid) or as precursors of hormones, coenzymes, pigments, purines, or pyrimidines. Eight amino acids, referred to as essential, cannot be synthesized by humans and must be obtained from dietary sources. The others are formed endogenously. Each amino acid has a unique degradative pathway by which its nitrogen and carbon components are used for the synthesis of other amino acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. Disorders of amino acid metabolism and transport (Chap. 365) are individually rare〞the incidences range from 1 in 10,000 for cystinuria or phenylketonuria to 1 in 200,000 for homocystinuria or alkaptonuria〞but collectively they affect perhaps 1 in 1,000 newborns. Almost all are transmitted as autosomal recessive traits.

The features of inherited disorders of amino acid catabolism are summarized in Table 364-1. In general, these disorders are named for the compound that accumulates to highest concentration in blood (-emias) or urine (-urias). For many conditions (often called aminoacidopathies), the parent amino acid is found in excess; for others, generally referred to as organic acidemias, products in the catabolic pathway accumulate. Which compound(s) accumulates depends on the site of the enzymatic block, the reversibility of the reactions proximal to the lesion, and the availability of alternative pathways of metabolic "runoff." Biochemical and genetic heterogeneity are common. Five distinct forms of hyperphenylalaninemia, seven forms of homocystinuria, and seven types of methylmalonic acidemia are recognized. Such heterogeneity reflects the presence of an even larger array of molecular defects.

The manifestations of these conditions differ widely (Table 364-1). Some, such as sarcosinemia, produce no clinical consequences. At the other extreme, complete deficiency of ornithine transcarbamylase is lethal in the untreated neonate. Central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, in the form of developmental retardation, seizures, alterations in sensorium, or behavioral disturbances, is present in more than half the disorders. Protein-induced vomiting, neurologic dysfunction, and hyperammonemia occur in many disorders of urea cycle intermediates. Metabolic ketoacidosis, often accompanied by hyperammonemia, is a frequent presenting finding in disorders of branched-chain amino acid metabolism. Some disorders produce focal tissue or organ involvement such as liver disease, renal failure, cutaneous abnormalities, or ocular lesions.

The analysis of plasma amino acids (by ion-exchange chromatography), urine organic acids (by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry), and plasma acylcarnitines (by tandem mass spectrometry) is commonly used to diagnose and monitor most of these disorders. The diagnosis is confirmed by enzyme assay on cells or tissues from the patients or by DNA testing. The clinical manifestations in many of these conditions can be prevented or mitigated if a diagnosis is achieved early and appropriate treatment (e.g., dietary protein or amino acid restriction or vitamin supplementation) is instituted promptly. For this reason, newborn screening programs seek to identify several of these disorders. Infants with a positive screening test need additional metabolic testing (usually suggested by the newborn screening program) to confirm or exclude the diagnosis. Confirmed cases should be referred to a metabolic center for initiation of therapy. The parents need to be counseled about the recurrence risk of the disease in future pregnancies. In some cases, parents need testing to exclude metabolic alterations seen in carriers for some of these disorders (such as some forms of homocystinuria) or because they might have a disorder themselves (such as methylcrotonyl CoA carboxylase deficiency, glutaric acidemia type 1, primary carnitine deficiency, or fatty acid oxidation defects). Some metabolic disorders can remain asymptomatic until adult age, presenting only when fasting or severe stress require full activity of affected metabolic pathways to provide energy.

Selected disorders that illustrate the principles, properties, and problems presented by the disorders of amino acid metabolism are discussed in this chapter.
 
The Hyperphenylalaninemias

The hyperphenylalaninemias (Table 364-1) result from impaired conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. The most common and clinically important is phenylketonuria (frequency 1:10,000), which is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an increased concentration of phenylalanine and its by-products in body fluids and by severe mental retardation if untreated in infancy. It results from reduced activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH deficiency phenylketonuria). The accumulation of phenylalanine inhibits the transport of other amino acids required for protein or neurotransmitter synthesis, reduces synthesis and increases degradation of myelin, and leads to inadequate formation of norepinephrine and serotonin. Phenylalanine is a competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase, a key enzyme in the pathway of melanin synthesis, and accounts for the hypopigmentation of hair and skin. Untreated children with classic phenylketonuria are normal at birth but fail to attain early developmental milestones, develop microcephaly, and demonstrate progressive impairment of cerebral function. Hyperactivity, seizures, and severe mental retardation are major clinical problems later in life. Electroencephalographic abnormalities; "mousy" odor of skin, hair, and urine (due to phenylacetate accumulation); and a tendency to hypopigmentation and eczema complete the devastating clinical picture. In contrast, affected children who are detected and treated at birth show none of these abnormalities.

Treatment: Phenylketonuria

To prevent mental retardation, diagnosis and initiation of dietary treatment of classic phenylketonuria must occur before the child is 3 weeks of age. For this reason, most newborns in North America, Australia, and Europe are screened by determinations of blood phenylalanine levels. Abnormal values are confirmed using quantitative analysis of plasma amino acids. Dietary phenylalanine restriction is usually instituted if blood phenylalanine levels are >300 mol/L (5 mg/dL). Treatment consists of a special diet low in phenylalanine and supplemented with tyrosine, since tyrosine becomes an essential amino acid in phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. With therapy, plasma phenylalanine concentrations should be maintained between 60 and 360 mol/L (1 and 6 mg/dL). Dietary restriction should be continued and monitored indefinitely. About one-third of all patients with phenylketonuria and the majority of those with milder forms (phenylalanine <1200 mol/L at presentation) show increased tolerance to dietary proteins and improved metabolic control when treated with tetrahydrobiopterin (5每20 mg/kg per day), an essential cofactor of phenylalanine hydroxylase. This drug should be used in addition to dietary therapy.

Women with phenylketonuria, who have been treated since infancy, reach adulthood and can become pregnant. If maternal phenylalanine levels are not strictly controlled before and during pregnancy, their offspring are at increased risk for congenital defects and microcephaly (maternal phenylketonuria). After birth, these children have severe mental and growth retardation. Pregnancy risks can be minimized by continuing lifelong phenylalanine-restricted diets and assuring strict phenylalanine restriction 2 months prior to conception and throughout gestation.
 
The Homocystinurias (Hyperhomocysteinemias)

The homocystinurias are seven biochemically and clinically distinct disorders (Table 364-1) characterized by increased concentration of the sulfur-containing amino acid homocystine in blood and urine.

Classic homocystinuria, the most common (frequency 1:200,000), results from reduced activity of cystathionine -synthase (Fig. 364-1), the pyridoxal phosphate每dependent enzyme that condenses homocysteine with serine to form cystathionine. Most patients present between 3 and 5 years of age with dislocated optic lenses and mental retardation (in about half of cases). Some patients develop a marfanoid habitus and radiologic evidence of osteoporosis.

Figure 364-1

 
 
 
Pathways, enzymes, and coenzymes involved in the homocystinurias. Methionine transfers a methyl group during its conversion to homocysteine. Defects in methyl transfer or in the subsequent metabolism of homocysteine by the pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6)-dependent cystathionine b-synthase increase plasma methionine levels. Homocysteine is transformed into methionine via remethylation. This occurs through methionine synthase, a reaction requiring methylcobalamin and folic acid. Deficiencies in these enzymes or lack of cofactors is associated with decreased or normal methionine levels. In an alternative pathway, homocysteine can be remethylated by betaine:homocysteine methyl transferase.
 
 

Life-threatening vascular complications (affecting coronary, renal, and cerebral arteries) can occur during the first decade of life and are the major cause of morbidity and mortality. Classic homocystinuria can be diagnosed with analysis of plasma amino acids, showing elevated methionine and presence of free homocystine. Total plasma homocysteine is also extremely elevated (usually >100 M). Treatment consists of a special diet restricted in protein and methionine and supplemented with cystine. In approximately half of patients, oral pyridoxine (25每500 mg/d) produces a decrease in plasma methionine and homocystine concentration in body fluids. Folate and vitamin B12 deficiency should be prevented by adequate supplementation. Betaine is also effective in reducing homocystine levels.

The other forms of homocystinuria are the result of impaired remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. This can be caused by defective methionine synthase or reduced availability of two essential cofactors, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and methylcobalamin (methyl-vitamin B12).

Hyperhomocysteinemia refers to increased total plasma concentration of homocysteine with or without an increase in free homocystine (disulfide form). Hyperhomocysteinemia, in the absence of significant homocystinuria, is found in some heterozygotes for the genetic defects noted above or in homozygotes for milder variants. Changes of homocysteine levels are also observed with increasing age; with smoking; in postmenopausal women; in patients with renal failure, hypothyroidism, leukemias, inflammatory bowel disease, or psoriasis; and during therapy with drugs such as methotrexate, nitrous oxide, isoniazid, and some antiepileptic agents. Homocysteine acts as an atherogenic and thrombophilic agent. An increase in total plasma homocysteine represents an independent risk factor for coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral arterial disease as well as for deep-vein thrombosis (Chap. 241). Homocysteine is synergistic with hypertension and smoking, and it is additive with other risk factors that predispose to peripheral arterial disease. In addition, hyperhomocysteinemia and folate and vitamin B12 deficiency have been associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects in pregnant women. Vitamin supplements are effective in reducing plasma homocysteine levels in these cases, although the risk reduction for cardiovascular disease and stroke has been inconsistent among different studies.
 
Alkaptonuria

Alkaptonuria is a rare (frequency 1:200,000) disorder of tyrosine catabolism in which deficiency of homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (also known as homogentisic acid oxidase) leads to excretion of large amounts of homogentisic acid in urine and accumulation of oxidized homogentisic acid pigment in connective tissues (ochronosis). Alkaptonuria may go unrecognized until middle life, when degenerative joint disease develops. Prior to this time, about half of patients might be diagnosed for the presence of dark urine. Foci of gray-brown scleral pigment and generalized darkening of the concha, anthelix, and, finally, helix of the ear usually develop after age 30. Low back pain usually starts between 30 and 40 years of age. Ochronotic arthritis is heralded by pain, stiffness, and some limitation of motion of the hips, knees, and shoulders. Acute arthritis may resemble rheumatoid arthritis, but small joints are usually spared. Pigmentation of heart valves, larynx, tympanic membranes, and skin occurs, and occasional patients develop pigmented renal or prostatic calculi. Degenerative cardiovascular disease is increased in older patients. The diagnosis should be suspected in a patient whose urine darkens to blackness. Homogentisic acid in urine is identified by urine organic acid analysis or by a specific colorimetric test. Ochronotic arthritis is treated symptomatically (Chap. 332). Nitisinone [2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione], a drug used in tyrosinemia type I, reduces urinary excretion of homogentisic acid, but it is still unclear whether it can prevent the long-term complications of alkaptonuria.
 
Urea Cycle Defects

Excess ammonia generated from protein nitrogen is removed by the urea cycle, a process mediated by several enzymes and transporters (Table 364-1). Complete absence of any of these enzymes usually causes severe hyperammonemia in newborns, while milder variants can be seen in adults. The accumulation of ammonia and glutamine leads to brain edema and direct neuronal toxicity. Deficiencies in urea cycle enzymes are individually rare, but as a group they affect about 1:25,000 individuals. They are all transmitted as autosomal recessive traits, with the exception of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, which is X-linked. Hepatocytes of females with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency express either the normal or the mutant allele due to random X-inactivation and may be unable to remove excess ammonia if mutant cells are predominant.

Infants with classic urea cycle defects present at 1每4 days of life with refusal to eat and lethargy progressing to coma and death. Milder enzyme deficiencies present with protein avoidance, recurrent vomiting, migraine, mood swings, chronic fatigue, irritability, and disorientation that can progress to coma. Acute liver failure can also be observed in adults. Females with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency or milder forms of other urea cycle defects can present at time of childbirth due to the combination of involuntary fasting and stress that favor catabolism. The diagnosis requires measurement of plasma ammonia, plasma amino acids, and urine orotic acid, useful for differentiating ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency from carbamyl phosphate synthase-1 and N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency. Hyperammonemia can also be caused by liver disease from any cause and several organic acidemias and fatty acid oxidation defects (the latter two excluded by the analysis of urine organic acids and plasma acylcarnitine profile).

Treatment: Urea Cycle Defects

Therapy is aimed at stopping catabolism and ammonia production by providing adequate calories (as intravenous glucose and lipids in the comatose patient) and, if needed, insulin. Excess nitrogen is removed by intravenous phenylacetate and benzoate (0.25 g/kg for the priming dose and subsequently as an infusion over 24 h) that conjugate with glutamine and glycine, respectively, to form phenylacetylglutamine and hippuric acid, water-soluble molecules efficiently excreted in urine. Arginine (200 mg/kg/d) becomes an essential amino acid (except in arginase deficiency) and should be provided intravenously to resume protein synthesis. Standard therapy of brain edema with mannitol and hypertonic saline should also be instituted in the comatose patient. If these measures fail to reduce ammonia, hemodialysis should be initiated promptly. Chronic therapy consists of a protein-restricted diet, phenylbutyrate (a more palatable precursor of phenylacetate), arginine or citrulline supplements, depending on the specific diagnosis. Liver transplantation should be considered in patients with severe urea cycle defects that are difficult to control medically.

Hyperammonemia due to a functional deficiency of glutamine synthase can occur in patients receiving chemotherapy for different malignancies or undergoing solid organ transplants. Several of these patients have been successfully rescued from hyperammonemia using the protocol described above for urea cycle defects.

 Chapter 365. Inherited Defects of Membrane Transport >
 

Inherited Defects of Membrane Transport: Introduction

Specific membrane transporters mediate the passage of a wide variety of substances across cellular membranes. Classes of substrates include amino acids, sugars, cations, anions, vitamins, and water. The number of inherited disorders of membrane transport continues to increase with the identification of new transporters and the clarification of the molecular basis of diseases with previously unknown pathophysiology. The first transport disorders identified affected the gut or the kidney, but transport processes are essential for the normal function of every organ. Mutations in transporter molecules cause disorders of the heart, muscle, brain, and endocrine and sensory organs (Table 365-1). Inherited defects impairing the transport of selected amino acids that can present in adults are discussed here as examples of the abnormalities encountered; others are considered elsewhere in this text.

Cystinuria

Cystinuria (frequency of 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 15,000) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by defective transporters in the apical brush border of proximal renal tubule and small intestinal cells. It is characterized by impaired reabsorption and excessive urinary excretion of the dibasic amino acids lysine, arginine, ornithine, and cystine. Because cystine is poorly soluble, its excess excretion predisposes to the formation of renal, ureteral, and bladder stones. Such stones are responsible for the signs and symptoms of the disorder.

There are two variants of cystinuria. Homozygotes for both variants have high urinary excretion of cystine, lysine, arginine, and ornithine. Type I heterozygotes usually have normal urinary amino acids, whereas most non-type I (formerly type II and type III) heterozygotes have moderately increased urinary excretion of each of the four amino acids. The gene for type I cystinuria (SLC3A1, chromosome 2p16.3) encodes a membrane glycoprotein. Non-type I cystinuria is caused by mutations in SLC7A9 (chromosome 19q13) that encodes the b0,+ amino acid transporter. The glycoprotein encoded by SLC3A1 favors the correct processing of the b0,+ membrane transporter, and explains why mutations in two different genes cause a similar disease.

Cystine stones account for 1每2% of all urinary tract calculi but are the most common cause of stones in children. Cystinuria homozygotes regularly excrete 2400每7200 mol (600每1800 mg) of cystine daily. Since the maximum solubility of cystine in the physiologic urinary pH range of 4.5每7.0 is about 1200 mol/L (300 mg/L), cystine needs to be diluted to 2.5每7 L of water to prevent crystalluria. Stone formation usually manifests in the second or third decade but may occur in the first year of life. Symptoms and signs are those typical of urolithiasis: hematuria, flank pain, renal colic, obstructive uropathy, and infection (Chap. 287). Recurrent urolithiasis may lead to progressive renal insufficiency.

Cystinuria is suspected after observing typical hexagonal crystals in the sediment of acidified, concentrated, chilled urine or after performing a urinary nitroprusside test. Quantitative urine amino acid analysis confirms the diagnosis of cystinuria by showing selective over excretion of cystine, lysine, arginine, and ornithine. Quantitative measurements are important for differentiating heterozygotes from homozygotes and for following free cystine excretion during therapy.

Management is aimed at preventing cystine crystal formation by increasing urinary volume and by maintaining an alkaline urine pH. Fluid ingestion in excess of 4 L/d is essential, and 5每7 L/d is optimal. Urinary cystine concentration should be <1000 mol/L (250 mg/L). The daily fluid ingestion necessary to maintain this dilution of excreted cystine should be spaced over 24 h, with one-third of the total volume ingested between bedtime and 3 a.m. Cystine solubility rises sharply above pH 7.5, and urinary alkalinization (with potassium citrate) can be therapeutic. Penicillamine (1每3 g/d) and tiopronin (-mercaptopropionylglycine, 800每1200 mg/d in four divided doses) undergo sulfhydryl-disulfide exchange with cystine to form mixed disulfides. Since these disulfides are much more soluble than cystine, pharmacologic therapy can prevent and promote dissolution of calculi. Penicillamine can have significant side effects and should be reserved for patients who fail to respond to hydration alone or who are in a high-risk category (one remaining kidney, renal insufficiency). The dose of penicillamine should be increased gradually to limit side-effects. When medical management fails, shock wave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy are effective for most stones. Open urologic surgery is considered for complex staghorn stones or when the patient has concomitant renal or ureteral abnormalities. Occasional patients progress to renal failure and require kidney transplantation.
 
Dibasic Aminoaciduria

This disorder is characterized by a defect in renal tubular reabsorption of the three dibasic amino acids lysine, arginine, and ornithine but not cystine. There are two variants, transmitted as autosomal recessive traits. In the common form of dibasic aminoaciduria (type II), also known as lysinuric protein intolerance, homozygotes show defective intestinal transport of dibasic amino acids as well as exaggerated renal losses. It is most common in Finland (1 in 60,000), Southern Italy, and Japan, but is rare elsewhere. The transport defect affects basolateral rather than luminal membrane transport and is associated with impairment of the urea cycle. The defective gene (SLC7A7, chromosome 14q11.2) encodes the membrane transporter, y+LAT, which associates with the cell-surface glycoprotein 4F2 heavy chain to form the complete sodium-independent transporter y+L.

Manifestations are related to the losses of ornithine, arginine, and lysine. Affected patients can present in childhood with hepatosplenomegaly, protein intolerance, and episodic ammonia intoxication. Older patients may present with severe osteoporosis, impairment of kidney function, or interstitial changes in the lungs. Plasma concentrations of lysine, arginine, and ornithine can be reduced, whereas urinary excretion of lysine and orotic acid are increased. Hyperammonemia may develop after the ingestion of protein loads or with infections, probably because of insufficient amounts of arginine and ornithine to maintain proper function of the urea cycle. The clinical features have been attributed to the hyperammonemia, to insufficient amounts of lysine to support protein synthesis during growth, and to decreased production of nitric oxide caused by arginine deficiency.

Therapy consists of dietary protein restriction and supplementation of citrulline (2每8 g/d), a neutral amino acid that fuels the urea cycle when metabolized to arginine and ornithine. Pulmonary disease responds to glucocorticoids or bronchoalveolar lavage in some patients. Women with lysinuric protein intolerance, who become pregnant, have an increased risk of anemia, toxemia, and bleeding complications during delivery. These can be minimized by aggressive nutritional therapy and control of blood pressure. Their infants can have intrauterine growth restriction but have normal neurologic function.
 
Hartnup Disease

Hartnup disease (frequency 1 in 24,000) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by pellagra-like skin lesions, variable neurologic manifestations, and neutral and aromatic aminoaciduria. Alanine, serine, threonine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, glutamine, asparagine, and histidine are excreted in urine in quantities 5每10 times greater than normal, and intestinal transport of these same amino acids is defective. The defective neutral amino acid transporter, B0AT1 encoded by the SLC6A19 gene on chromosome 5p15, localizes to the apical membrane in renal tubular and intestinal cells.

The clinical manifestations result from nutritional deficiency of the essential amino acid tryptophan, caused by its intestinal and renal malabsorption, and of niacin, which derives in part from tryptophan metabolism. Only a small fraction of patients with the chemical findings of this disorder develop a pellagra-like syndrome, implying that manifestations depend on other factors in addition to the transport defect. The diagnosis of Hartnup disease should be suspected in any patient with clinical features of pellagra who does not have a history of dietary niacin deficiency (Chap. 74). The neurologic and psychiatric manifestations range from attacks of cerebellar ataxia to mild emotional lability to frank delirium, and they are usually accompanied by exacerbations of the erythematous, eczematoid skin rash. Fever, sunlight, stress, and sulfonamide therapy provoke clinical relapses. Diagnosis is made by detection of the neutral aminoaciduria, which does not occur in dietary niacin deficiency. Treatment is directed at niacin repletion and includes a high-protein diet and daily nicotinamide supplementation (50每250 mg).
